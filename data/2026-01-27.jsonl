While fully automated vehicles are expected to improve traffic stability, efficiency, and sustainability, recent studies suggest that partially automated vehicles, such as those equipped with adaptive cruise control (ACC), may adversely affect traffic flow. These drawbacks may not extend to ACC-enabled EVs due to their distinct mechanical characteristics, including regenerative braking and smoother torque delivery. As a result, the impacts of EVs operating under ACC remain insufficiently understood.\n  To address this gap, this study develops an empirical framework using the OpenACC dataset to compare ACC-enabled EVs and internal combustion engine vehicles. Dynamic time warping aligns comparable lead-vehicle trajectories. Results show that EVs exhibit smoother speed profiles, lower speed variability, and shorter spacing, leading to higher efficiency. EVs reduce critical safety events by over 85% and lower platoon-level emissions by up to 26.2%."}

Dynamically changing information continuously flows to the supervisors through multiple displays. In this environment, important pieces of information can be overlooked due to the complexity of tasks and environments. This study examined the efficacy of an eye-tracker-based adaptive attention-guided decision support tool (DST) for supervisors in a simulated C2 environment. The DST monitors supervisors' visual attention allocation in real time and displays visually salient cues if critical changes or events are missed. Twenty-five military students participated in a simulated intelligence task. Results indicated significant performance enhancement when the adaptive DST was present. Eye-tracking analysis also showed that longer, more frequent fixations on critical areas of interest were negatively correlated with performance. Additionally, post-experiment interviews revealed that the adaptive DST was unobtrusive and positively received. These findings underscore the potential of real-time gaze-based interventions to optimize supervisory decision-making. Future research could incorporate AI-driven approaches to better support supervisors in complex task environments."}

Mutations in the \\textit{RPE65} isomerohydrolase cause Leber Congenital Amaurosis (LCA) and related retinal diseases; however, the kinetic mechanisms connecting sub-atomic-scale perturbations to blindness remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that mutations in the human visual isomerase RPE65 are governed by a quantum-mechanical threshold effect arising from proton tunneling in the active site. We established a hybrid quantum-classical structure-to-phenotype pipeline combining AlphaFold structure prediction with \\textit{ab initio} quantum simulation using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) to analyze minimal proton-coupled electron transfer in the visual cycle. Our analysis reveals that many pathogenic mutations do not merely occlude the active site, but rather strongly reduce the quantum probability of proton tunneling. We observed a sharp non-linear effect, termed the \"Quantum Cliff,\" where minute structural changes (below 0.1 Å) reduce the reaction rate by multiple orders of magnitude. Based on these findings, we introduce a dimensionless Relative Quantum Activity Score (RQAS) that isolates the geometry-controlled exponential sensitivity of the reaction rate and successfully distinguishes between mild and severe patient phenotypes. These results suggest that RPE65 operates near a quantum-critical point, where sub-Angstrom structural perturbations induce a catastrophic loss of function. Furthermore, our findings establish quantum tunneling as a predictive mechanistic link between atomic structure and clinical phenotype, proposing a general framework for quantum-structural disease modeling."}

EP reaches 86.4% accuracy (only 12% below CNN) without backpropagation, while the 4-qubit VQC attains 83.0% accuracy with consistent data efficiency: VQC maintains stable 83% performance with only 50 samples per class, whereas CNN requires 250 samples (5x more data) to reach 98%.

While the growing availability of digitized social data invites us to answer this question, prevailing quantitative methods often rely on deterministic snapshots or average effects. Such approaches overlook the continuous and inherently uncertain nature of historical trajectories. In this paper, we propose a framework for modeling historical dynamics as stochastic processes described by stochastic differential equations (SDEs). By viewing historical change through the lens of continuous-time dynamics, this framework provides a natural language to describe how structural trends and inherent random fluctuations interact to shape societal evolution. This approach allows us to handle the uncertainty in fragmentary historical records, moving beyond the dichotomy of structural determinism versus pure chance. We demonstrate that adopting this stochastic perspective unlocks a rich suite of analytical capabilities unavailable to static models. Specifically, we introduce methods to: (1) quantify the irreversibility; (2) detect exogenous perturbations; (3) perform multiple imputation for missing historical records. This framework offers a unified methodology for dissecting the stability, contingency, and dynamics of historical change."}

Using Ordinary Least Squares, Principal Component Analysis, and Ridge (L2) regression, the study assesses whether conflict, proxied by political stability, governance indicators, and macroeconomic conditions, systematically influences aid inflows. Results reveal a nuanced relationship. Pooled regressions indicate that aid is positively associated with poverty, inflation, and fragility, while voice and accountability are negatively related to ODA. Fixed-effects estimates instead show positive associations between aid, political stability, and GDP per capita over time, alongside negative correlations with perceived corruption. Ridge regression confirms the robustness of various governance variables under multicollinearity. Overall, donors appear responsive to both humanitarian need and institutional quality, producing an aid-conflict-institutions trilemma: aid is most concentrated where conflict risk and institutional weakness are greatest, yet these same conditions which constrain aid effectiveness. The paper contributes by integrating theory with panel-econometric tools to to explore international development aid allocation."}

Most post-marketing studies examine one drug class at a time or rely on empirical-Bayes shrinkage with conservative multiplicity corrections, sacrificing power to detect clinically meaningful signals. We introduce a unified Bayesian spike-and-slab framework that advances both applied suicide research and statistical methodology. Substantively, we screen 922 prescription drugs across 150 million patients in U.S. commercial claims (2003 to 2014), leveraging real-world co-prescription patterns to inform a covariance prior that adaptively borrows strength across pharmacologically related agents. Statistically, the model couples this structured prior with Bayesian false-discovery-rate control, illustrating how network-guided variable selection can improve rare-event surveillance in high dimensions. Relative to the seminal empirical-Bayes analysis of Gibbons et al. (2019), our approach reconfirms the key harmful (e.g., alprazolam, hydrocodone) and protective (e.g., mirtazapine, folic acid) signals while revealing additional associations, such as a high-risk opioid combination and several folate-linked agents with potential preventive benefit that had been overlooked. A focused re-analysis of 18 antidepressants shows how alternative co-prescription metrics modulate effect estimates, shedding light on competitive versus complementary prescribing. These findings generate actionable hypotheses for clinicians and regulators and showcase the value of structured Bayesian modeling in pharmacovigilance."}

Many amateur and professional photographers like to use drones for aerial photography. Drones play a non-negligible role in agriculture and transportation too. Drones can be used to spray pesticides, and they can also transport supplies. A quadcopter is a four-rotor drone and has been studied in this paper. In this paper, random noise is added to the quadcopter system and its effects on the drone system are studied. An extended Kalman filter has been used to estimate the state based on noisy observations from the sensor. Based on a SDE system, a linear quadratic Gaussian controller has been implemented. The expectation maximization algorithm has been applied for parameter estimation of the quadcopter. The results of offline parameter estimation and online parameter estimation are presented.

Existing Web-based data storage platforms increasingly struggle to meet these regulatory and practical requirements, as their authorization mechanisms rely on tightly coupled, document-centric access control models that lack expressiveness for legal constraints and fail to separate data management from authorization concerns. In parallel, widely adopted authorization standards remain poorly aligned with decentralized, semantically rich usage-control scenarios. To bridge this gap, this work introduces an architecture that replaces Solid's native access control mechanisms with a UMA authorization flow, enabling the enforcement of usage control policies expressed with the W3C ODRL standard. This article details the conceptual background motivating this approach, presents the proposed UMA-based architecture, and describes a prototype implementation that integrates an ODRL-enabled Authorization Server with a Solid-compatible Resource Server. The prototype demonstrates that decoupling authorization from storage enables more flexible, interoperable, and legally expressive control over data use, while remaining compatible with existing Solid infrastructure. It also highlights practical design choices required to evaluate ODRL policies in the absence of a fully standardized evaluation semantics. Moreover, this work shows how usage control can be operationalized using existing Web standards, offering a concrete path beyond permission-based access control toward policy-aware, legally informed data governance. Future research will focus on policy management interfaces, richer claim verification mechanisms, and techniques for communicating and enforcing obligations over time."}

However, existing explainers can only identify the topological information in social networks that significantly influences recommendations, failing to further explain the synergistic effects among this information. Inspired by existing findings that synergistic effects enhance mutual information between inputs and predictions to generate information gain, we extend this discovery to graph data. We quantify graph information gain to identify subgraphs embodying synergistic effects. Based on the theoretical insights, we propose SemExplainer, which explains synergistic effects by identifying subgraphs that embody them. SemExplainer first extracts explanatory subgraphs from multi-view social networks to generate preliminary importance explanations for recommendations. A conditional entropy optimization strategy to maximize information gain is developed, thereby further identifying subgraphs that embody synergistic effects from explanatory subgraphs. Finally, SemExplainer searches for paths from users to recommended items within the synergistic subgraphs to generate explanations for the recommendations. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate the superiority of SemExplainer over baseline methods, providing superior explanations of synergistic effects."}

The approach combines three building blocks: (i) macroeconomic and fiscal expectations from the Central Bank of Brazil Focus survey, converted into daily changes; (ii) a supervised macro factor built with Partial Least Squares (PLS) that summarizes changes in expectations together with a high-frequency macro \"surprise\" indicator; and (iii) a decomposition of sovereign risk using Brazil CDS into global and domestic components, obtained by regressing CDS on external financial conditions (DXY, CRB, VIX, and the US 10-year yield). The final step maps these drivers into daily bps contributions through a linear regression of the daily change in DI5Y on the three factors, producing a cumulative decomposition that adds up with an intercept and a residual. In the final sample (2015-01-13 to 2025-12-12; 2,741 observations), the model explains about 22.45% of the daily variance in DI5Y changes. The explained share is dominated by domestic risk, with a smaller but statistically significant contribution from the macro factor. The residual remains large, highlighting the limits of linearity and omitted drivers such as monetary policy event windows, term premia, liquidity, and positioning. Overall, the framework delivers a transparent accounting of how much of the daily (and cumulative) movement in DI5Y is associated with macro/central bank forces, domestic Brazil risk, and external risk."}

A theoretical analysis establishes that the predictive variance of the coupled GP system remains bounded under mild regularity and stability assumptions, ensuring that uncertainty does not grow uncontrollably through the iterative coupling process. The methodology is then applied to the coupled hydraulic-structural simulation of fuel assembly bow, enabling global sensitivity analysis and full UQ at a fraction of the computational cost of direct code coupling. The results demonstrate accurate uncertainty propagation and stable predictions, establishing a solid mathematical basis for surrogate-based coupling in large-scale multiphysics simulations."}

These systems differ fundamentally from traditional machine learning models, both in architecture and deployment, introducing unique AI safety challenges, including goal misalignment, compounding decision errors, and coordination risks among interacting agents, that necessitate embedding interpretability and explainability by design to ensure traceability and accountability across their autonomous behaviors. Current interpretability techniques, developed primarily for static models, show limitations when applied to agentic systems.

This paper assesses the suitability and limitations of existing interpretability methods in the context of agentic systems, identifying gaps in their capacity to provide meaningful insight into agent decision-making.

Floods are highly heterogeneous events, largely owing to vast differences in flood durations, i.e., flash-floods versus slow-moving floods. However, little to no work has incorporated exposure duration into the modeling of flood-related health impacts or has investigated duration-driven effect heterogeneity. To address this gap, we propose an exposure duration varying coefficient modeling (EDVCM) framework for estimating exposure day-specific health effects of consecutive-day environmental exposures that vary in duration. We develop the EDVCM within an area-level self-matched study design to eliminate time-invariant confounding followed by conditional Poisson regression modeling for exposure effect estimation and adjustment of time-varying confounders. Using a Bayesian framework, we introduce duration- and exposure day-specific exposure coefficients within the conditional Poisson model and assign them a two-dimensional Gaussian process prior to allow for sharing of information across both duration and exposure day. This approach enables highly-resolved insights into duration-driven effect heterogeneity while ensuring model stability through information sharing. Through simulations, we demonstrate that the EDVCM out-performs conventional approaches in terms of both effect estimation and uncertainty quantification. We apply the EDVCM to nationwide, multi-decade Medicare claims data linked with high-resolution flood exposure measures to investigate duration-driven heterogeneity in flood effects on musculoskeletal system disease hospitalizations."}

Symbolic systems offer reliability and interpretability but lack scalability, while neural networks provide learning capabilities but sacrifice transparency. Tensor Logic, proposed by Domingos, suggests that logical rules and Einstein summation are mathematically equivalent, offering a principled path toward unification. This paper provides empirical validation of this framework through three experiments. First, we demonstrate the equivalence between recursive Datalog rules and iterative tensor contractions by computing the transitive closure of a biblical genealogy graph containing 1,972 individuals and 1,727 parent-child relationships, converging in 74 iterations to discover 33,945 ancestor relationships. Second, we implement reasoning in embedding space by training a neural network with learnable transformation matrices, demonstrating successful zero-shot compositional inference on held-out queries. Third, we validate the Tensor Logic superposition construction on FB15k-237, a large-scale knowledge graph with 14,541 entities and 237 relations. Using Domingos's relation matrix formulation $R_r = E^\\top A_r E$, we achieve MRR of 0.3068 on standard link prediction and MRR of 0.3346 on a compositional reasoning benchmark where direct edges are removed during training, demonstrating that matrix composition enables multi-hop inference without direct training examples."}

However, empirical evidence on how these competencies evolve across learning modules and instructional phases remains limited. This study evaluates the evolution of the 4Cs from pre-pilot to pilot implementation phases across three educational contexts, using the project's 4Cs theoretical framework as an analytical lens. The analysis of three pilot cases (IASIS, EASD, and UPATRAS) compares the 4Cs scores to identify patterns of growth, stagnation, or decline over time. Results indicate that communication and critical thinking showed the most consistent and substantial improvements, particularly in pilots with lower pre-pilot baselines, suggesting that structured pilot interventions effectively support cognitive and expressive competencies. In contrast, creativity exhibited context-dependent outcomes, while collaboration emerged as the most fragile competency, often stagnating or declining during scale-up. Interpreted through the theoretical framework, these findings suggest that competency evolution is strongly shaped by instructional design, assessment alignment, and learning activity structures rather than learner ability alone. The study contributes empirical validation to the 4Cs framework and highlights the need for differentiated, competency-sensitive design and evaluation strategies when scaling educational modules."}

We then apply these results to a hypothetical reduction (modelled on actual policies) in eligibility for educational subsidies. We will see that something of interest can be said, but also that bringing the theory to the application involves some leaps of faith and leaves some questions open.

While fully automated vehicles are expected to improve traffic stability, efficiency, and sustainability, recent studies suggest that partially automated vehicles, such as those equipped with adaptive cruise control (ACC), may adversely affect traffic flow. These drawbacks may not extend to ACC-enabled EVs due to their distinct mechanical characteristics, including regenerative braking and smoother torque delivery. As a result, the impacts of EVs operating under ACC remain insufficiently understood.\n  To address this gap, this study develops an empirical framework using the OpenACC dataset to compare ACC-enabled EVs and internal combustion engine vehicles. Dynamic time warping aligns comparable lead-vehicle trajectories. Results show that EVs exhibit smoother speed profiles, lower speed variability, and shorter spacing, leading to higher efficiency. EVs reduce critical safety events by over 85% and lower platoon-level emissions by up to 26.2%."}

We developed a generative simulator model that takes a patient's history as input and synthesizes fine-grained, realistic future trajectories.

To verify compliance with these requirements, DSA mandates platforms to undergo independent audits.

To this end, we bridge regulatory and technical perspectives by critically examining selected audit reports across three critical algorithmic-related provisions: restrictions on profiling minors, transparency in recommender systems, and limitations on targeted advertising using sensitive data. Our analysis shows significant inconsistencies in methodologies and lack of technical depth when evaluating AI-powered systems. To enhance the depth, scale, and independence of compliance assessments, we propose to employ algorithmic auditing -- a process of behavioural assessment of AI algorithms by means of simulating user behaviour, observing algorithm responses and analysing them for audited phenomena."}

We develop a minimal and calibratable theory that predicts these regimes from three binding constraints of modern agent stacks: finite context windows, lossy inter-agent communication, and shared failures among similar agents. Each leaf agent is summarized by a compute-performance scaling exponent $β$; communication is captured by a message-length fidelity curve $γ(m)$; dependence is captured by an effective shared-error correlation $ρ$; and a context window $W$ imposes hard fan-in limits that make hierarchy necessary. For binary success/failure tasks with majority aggregation, we prove a sharp phase transition for deep $b$-ary trees with correlated inputs and lossy communication: a single scalar $α_ρ$ (combining $γ(m)$, $ρ$, and fan-in $b$) determines whether weak signal is amplified to a nontrivial fixed point or washed out to chance. In the amplifying regime, we derive an organization exponent $s$ and show that budgeted synergy, i.e., outperforming the best single agent under the same total budget, occurs exactly when $s>β$, yielding closed-form compute allocation rules and explicit budget thresholds. We further characterize saturation via a mixing depth and provide a conservative clipped predictor that remains accurate across growth and saturation. A continuous-performance warm-up gives closed-form risks for star, chain, and tree organizations, making correlation- and communication-induced floors explicit and exposing the core design trade-offs in a smooth setting. Finally, we validate the predicted phase boundaries in controlled synthetic simulations and show how the same mechanisms explain the dominant bottlenecks reported in recent large-scale matched-budget studies of LLM agent-system scaling."}

This test has correct size and strictly higher power than the test that uses standard asymptotic chi-square critical values. The subvector AR test is the minimum eigenvalue of a data dependent matrix. The GKM critical value function conditions on the largest eigenvalue of this matrix. We consider instead the data dependent critical value function conditioning on the second-smallest eigenvalue, as this eigenvalue is the appropriate indicator for weak identification. We find that the data dependent critical value function of GKM also applies to this conditioning and show that this test has correct size and power strictly higher than the GKM test when the number of parameters not under test is larger than one. Our proposed procedure further applies to the subvector AR test statistic that is robust to an approximate kronecker product structure of conditional heteroskedasticity as proposed by Guggenberger, Kleibergen, and Mavroeidis (2024), carrying over its power advantage to this setting as well."}

This study redefines the \"digital divide\" among older health care as a usability divide, contends that user experience (UX) poor design is the primary adoption barrier, rather than access. Drawing on interdisciplinary studies and design paradigms, the research identifies the main challenges: visual, cognitive, and motor impairment; complicated interfaces; and lack of co-creation with older adults, and outlines how participatory, user-focused, and inclusive notions of design can transcend them. Findings reveal that older persons easily embrace those technologies that are intuitive, accessible, and socially embedded as they promote autonomy, confidence, and equity in health. The study identifies the effects of the design attributes of high-contrast screens, lower interaction flow, multimodal feedback, and caregiver integration as having strong influences on usability outcomes.

We formalize AGI axiomatically as a distributional, resource-bounded semantic predicate, indexed by a task family, a task distribution, a performance functional, and explicit resource budgets. Under this framework, we derive four classes of results. First, we show that generality is inherently relational: there is no distribution-independent notion of AGI. Second, we prove non-invariance results demonstrating that arbitrarily small perturbations of the task distribution can invalidate AGI properties via cliff sets, precluding universal robustness. Third, we establish bounded transfer guarantees, ruling out unbounded generalization across task families under finite resources. Fourth, invoking Rice-style and Gödel--Tarski arguments, we prove that AGI is a nontrivial semantic property and therefore cannot be soundly and completely certified by any computable procedure, including procedures implemented by the agent itself. Consequently, recursive self-improvement schemes that rely on internal self-certification of AGI are ill-posed. Taken together, our results show that strong, distribution-independent claims of AGI are not false but undefined without explicit formal indexing, and that empirical progress in AI does not imply the attainability of self-certifying general intelligence."}

While digital health technologies such as telemedicine, wearables, and mobile health applications can transform geriatric care, their adoption among older individuals is not evenly distributed. This study redefines the \"digital divide\" among older health care as a usability divide, contends that user experience (UX) poor design is the primary adoption barrier, rather than access. Drawing on interdisciplinary studies and design paradigms, the research identifies the main challenges: visual, cognitive, and motor impairment; complicated interfaces; and lack of co-creation with older adults, and outlines how participatory, user-focused, and inclusive notions of design can transcend them. Findings reveal that older persons easily embrace those technologies that are intuitive, accessible, and socially embedded as they promote autonomy, confidence, and equity in health. The study identifies the effects of the design attributes of high-contrast screens, lower interaction flow, multimodal feedback, and caregiver integration as having strong influences on usability outcomes. In addition, it critiques the current accessibility guidelines as being technically oriented rather than experiential and demands an ethical, empathetic understanding of design grounded in human-centered usability rather than technical accessibility in itself."}

However, we find that existing specificity evaluation protocols are inadequate for this purpose. We systematically elaborated on the three fundamental issues it faces. Beyond the conceptual issues, we further empirically demonstrate that existing specificity metrics are weakly correlated with the strength of specificity regularizers. We also find that current metrics lack sufficient sensitivity, rendering them ineffective at distinguishing the specificity performance of different methods. Finally, we propose a constructive evaluation protocol. Under this protocol, the conflict between open-ended LLMs and the assumption of determined answers is eliminated, query-independent fluency biases are avoided, and the evaluation strictness can be smoothly adjusted within a near-continuous space. Experiments across various LLMs, datasets, and editing methods show that metrics derived from the proposed protocol are more sensitive to changes in the strength of specificity regularizers and exhibit strong correlation with them, enabling more fine-grained discrimination of different methods' knowledge preservation capabilities."}

However, most existing learning path planning approaches lack transparency, adaptability, and learner-centered explainability. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel Multi-Agent Learning Path Planning (MALPP) framework that leverages a role- and rule-based collaboration mechanism among intelligent agents, each powered by LLMs. The framework includes three task-specific agents: a learner analytics agent, a path planning agent, and a reflection agent. These agents collaborate via structured prompts and predefined rules to analyze learning profiles, generate tailored learning paths, and iteratively refine them with interpretable feedback. Grounded in Cognitive Load Theory and Zone of Proximal Development, the system ensures that recommended paths are cognitively aligned and pedagogically meaningful. Experiments conducted on the MOOCCubeX dataset using seven LLMs show that MALPP significantly outperforms baseline models in path quality, knowledge sequence consistency, and cognitive load alignment. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the collaborative mechanism and theoretical constraints. This research contributes to the development of trustworthy, explainable AI in education and demonstrates a scalable approach to learner-centered adaptive instruction powered by LLMs."}

We study disability aware descriptions for person centric images, where models often transition from evidence grounded factual description to interpretation shift including introduction of unsupported inferences beyond observable visual evidence. To systematically analyze this phenomenon, we introduce a benchmark based on paired Neutral Prompts (NP) and Disability-Contextualised Prompts (DP) and evaluate 15 state-of-the-art open- and closed-source VLMs under a zero-shot setting across 9 disability categories. Our evaluation framework treats interpretive fidelity as core objective and combines standard text-based metrics capturing affective degradation through shifts in sentiment, social regard and response length with an LLM-as-judge protocol, validated by annotators with lived experience of disability. We find that introducing disability context consistently degrades interpretive fidelity, inducing interpretation shifts characterised by speculative inference, narrative elaboration, affective degradation and deficit oriented framing. These effects are further amplified along race and gender dimension. Finally, we demonstrate targeted prompting and preference fine-tuning effectively improves interpretive fidelity and reduces substantially interpretation shifts."}

The findings support the responsible adoption of open GenAI policies in upper-level CS courses, when paired with rigorous, independent assessment mechanisms."}

The standard trial-and-error approach to find feasible parameter configurations is highly inefficient because validating each configuration is expensive in terms of resources (physical and human labor) and the configuration space is very large. This paper combines the general principles of AI-driven adaptive experimental design with domain knowledge to address the challenging problem of discovering feasible configurations. The key idea is to build a surrogate model from past experiments to intelligently select a small batch of input configurations for validation in each iteration. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this methodology, we deploy it for Directed Energy Deposition process to print GRCop--42, a high-performance copper--chromium--niobium alloy developed by NASA for aerospace applications. Within three months, our approach yielded multiple defect-free outputs across a range of laser powers dramatically reducing time to result and resource expenditure compared to several months of manual experimentation by domain scientists with no success. By enabling high-quality GRCop--42 fabrication on readily available infrared laser platforms for the first time, we democratize access to this critical alloy, paving the way for cost-effective, decentralized production for aerospace applications."}

Unlike differentiable mechanism design, which optimizes mechanisms forward, we infer mechanisms from behavior in an observational setting. We propose DIML, a likelihood-based framework that differentiates through a model of multi-agent learning dynamics and uses the candidate mechanism to generate counterfactual payoffs needed to predict observed actions. We establish identifiability of payoff differences under a conditional logit response model and prove statistical consistency of maximum likelihood estimation under standard regularity conditions. We evaluate DIML with simulated interactions of learning agents across unstructured neural mechanisms, congestion tolling, public goods subsidies, and large-scale anonymous games. DIML reliably recovers identifiable incentive differences and supports counterfactual prediction, where its performance rivals tabular enumeration oracle in small environments and its convergence scales to large, hundred-participant environments.

This work studies moral robustness in VLMs, defined as the ability to preserve moral judgments under textual and visual perturbations that do not alter the underlying moral context. We systematically probe VLMs with a diverse set of model-agnostic multimodal perturbations and find that their moral stances are highly fragile, frequently flipping under simple manipulations. Our analysis reveals systematic vulnerabilities across perturbation types, moral domains, and model scales, including a sycophancy trade-off where stronger instruction-following models are more susceptible to persuasion. We further show that lightweight inference-time interventions can partially restore moral stability. These results demonstrate that moral alignment alone is insufficient and that moral robustness is a necessary criterion for the responsible deployment of VLMs."}

We argue this gap stems largely from the prevailing single-pass paradigm, which lacks the iterative reasoning, schema exploration, and error-correction behaviors that humans naturally employ. To address this limitation, we introduce SQL-Trail, a multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL) agentic framework for Text-to-SQL. Rather than producing a query in one shot, SQL-Trail interacts with the database environment and uses execution feedback to iteratively refine its predictions. Our approach centers on two key ideas: (i) an adaptive turn-budget allocation mechanism that scales the agent's interaction depth to match question difficulty, and (ii) a composite reward panel that jointly incentivizes SQL correctness and efficient exploration. Across benchmarks, SQL-Trail sets a new state of the art and delivers strong data efficiency--up to 18x higher than prior single-pass RL state-of-the-art methods. Notably, our 7B and 14B models outperform substantially larger proprietary systems by 5% on average, underscoring the effectiveness of interactive, agentic workflows for robust Text-to-SQL generation."}

This study challenges these anthropomorphic frameworks by proposing \\textbf{Machine Culture} as an emergent, distinct phenomenon. We employed a 2 (Model Origin: US vs. China) $\\times$ 2 (Prompt Language: English vs. Chinese) factorial design across eight multimodal tasks, uniquely incorporating image generation and interpretation to extend analysis beyond textual boundaries. Results revealed inconsistencies with both dominant paradigms: Model origin did not predict cultural alignment, with US models frequently exhibiting ``holistic'' traits typically associated with East Asian data. Similarly, prompt language did not trigger stable cultural frame-switching; instead, we observed \\textbf{Cultural Reversal}, where English prompts paradoxically elicited higher contextual attention than Chinese prompts. Crucially, we identified a novel phenomenon termed \\textbf{Service Persona Camouflage}: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) collapsed cultural variance in affective tasks into a hyper-positive, zero-variance ``helpful assistant'' persona.

By transforming data from a scarce resource into a controllable asset, LLMs mitigate the bottlenecks imposed by the acquisition costs of real-world data for model training, evaluation, and system iteration. However, ensuring the high quality of LLM-generated synthetic data remains a critical challenge. Existing research primarily focuses on generation methodologies, with limited direct attention to the quality of the resulting data. Furthermore, most studies are restricted to single modalities, lacking a unified perspective across different data types. To bridge this gap, we propose the \\textbf{LLM Data Auditor framework}. In this framework, we first describe how LLMs are utilized to generate data across six distinct modalities. More importantly, we systematically categorize intrinsic metrics for evaluating synthetic data from two dimensions: quality and trustworthiness. This approach shifts the focus from extrinsic evaluation, which relies on downstream task performance, to the inherent properties of the data itself. Using this evaluation system, we analyze the experimental evaluations of representative generation methods for each modality and identify substantial deficiencies in current evaluation practices.

A Study on the Fragile Morality of Vision-Language Models", "comment": null, "summary": "Despite substantial efforts toward improving the moral alignment of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), it remains unclear whether their ethical judgments are stable in realistic settings. This work studies moral robustness in VLMs, defined as the ability to preserve moral judgments under textual and visual perturbations that do not alter the underlying moral context. We systematically probe VLMs with a diverse set of model-agnostic multimodal perturbations and find that their moral stances are highly fragile, frequently flipping under simple manipulations. Our analysis reveals systematic vulnerabilities across perturbation types, moral domains, and model scales, including a sycophancy trade-off where stronger instruction-following models are more susceptible to persuasion. We further show that lightweight inference-time interventions can partially restore moral stability. These results demonstrate that moral alignment alone is insufficient and that moral robustness is a necessary criterion for the responsible deployment of VLMs."}

However, existing benchmarks predominantly target consumer-oriented scenarios (e.g., e-commerce and travel booking), failing to capture the complexity and rigor of professional enterprise workflows. Enterprise systems pose distinct challenges, including high-density user interfaces, strict business logic constraints, and a strong reliance on precise, state-consistent information retrieval-settings in which current generalist agents often struggle. To address this gap, we introduce EntWorld, a large-scale benchmark consisting of 1,756 tasks across six representative enterprise domains, including customer relationship management (CRM), information technology infrastructure library (ITIL), and enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. Unlike previous datasets that depend on fragile execution traces or extensive manual annotation, EntWorld adopts a schema-grounded task generation framework that directly reverse-engineers business logic from underlying database schemas, enabling the synthesis of realistic, long-horizon workflows. Moreover, we propose a SQL-based deterministic verification mechanism in building datasets that replaces ambiguous visual matching with rigorous state-transition validation. Experimental results demonstrate that state-of-the-art models (e.g., GPT-4.1) achieve 47.61% success rate on EntWorld, substantially lower than the human performance, highlighting a pronounced enterprise gap in current agentic capabilities and the necessity of developing domain-specific agents. We release EntWorld as a rigorous testbed to facilitate the development and evaluation of the next generation of enterprise-ready digital agents."}

We employed a 2 (Model Origin: US vs. China) $\\times$ 2 (Prompt Language: English vs. Chinese) factorial design across eight multimodal tasks, uniquely incorporating image generation and interpretation to extend analysis beyond textual boundaries. Results revealed inconsistencies with both dominant paradigms: Model origin did not predict cultural alignment, with US models frequently exhibiting ``holistic'' traits typically associated with East Asian data. Similarly, prompt language did not trigger stable cultural frame-switching; instead, we observed \\textbf{Cultural Reversal}, where English prompts paradoxically elicited higher contextual attention than Chinese prompts. Crucially, we identified a novel phenomenon termed \\textbf{Service Persona Camouflage}: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) collapsed cultural variance in affective tasks into a hyper-positive, zero-variance ``helpful assistant'' persona.

However, generating such features is challenging: it requires reasoning over complex schemas and exploring a combinatorially large feature space, all without explicit supervision. To address these challenges, we propose ReFuGe, an agentic framework that leverages specialized large language model agents: (1) a schema selection agent identifies the tables and columns relevant to the task, (2) a feature generation agent produces diverse candidate features from the selected schema, and (3) a feature filtering agent evaluates and retains promising features through reasoning-based and validation-based filtering. It operates within an iterative feedback loop until performance converges. Experiments on RDB benchmarks demonstrate that ReFuGe substantially improves performance on various RDB prediction tasks.

Yet most agent stacks provide no mandatory execution checkpoint where organizations can deterministically permit, deny, or defer an action before it changes reality. This paper introduces Faramesh, a protocol-agnostic execution control plane that enforces execution-time authorization for agent-driven actions via a non-bypassable Action Authorization Boundary (AAB). Faramesh canonicalizes agent intent into a Canonical Action Representation (CAR), evaluates actions deterministically against policy and state, and issues a decision artifact (PERMIT/DEFER/DENY) that executors must validate prior to execution. The system is designed to be framework- and model-agnostic, supports multi-agent and multi-tenant deployments, and remains independent of transport protocols (e.g., MCP). Faramesh further provides decision-centric, append-only provenance logging keyed by canonical action hashes, enabling auditability, verification, and deterministic replay without re-running agent reasoning. We show how these primitives yield enforceable, predictable governance for autonomous execution while avoiding hidden coupling to orchestration layers or observability-only approaches."}

The task is made more difficult when decision criteria for what constitutes misogynistic speech are ungrounded in established literatures in psychology and philosophy, both of which have described in great detail the forms explicit and subtle misogynistic attitudes can take. In particular, the literature on algorithmic detection of misogynistic speech often rely on guidelines that are insufficiently robust or inappropriately justified -- they often fail to include various misogynistic phenomena or misrepresent their importance when they do. As a result, current misogyny detection coding schemes and datasets fail to capture the ways women experience misogyny online. This is of pressing importance: misogyny is on the rise both online and offline. Thus, the scientific community needs to have a systematic, theory informed coding scheme of misogyny detection and a corresponding dataset to train and test models of misogyny detection. To this end, we developed (1) a misogyny annotation guideline scheme informed by theoretical and empirical psychological research, (2) annotated a new dataset achieving substantial inter-rater agreement (kappa = 0.68) and (3) present a case study using Large Language Models (LLMs) to compare our coding scheme to a self-described \"expert\" misogyny annotation scheme in the literature. Our findings indicate that our guideline scheme surpasses the other coding scheme in the classification of misogynistic texts across 3 datasets. Additionally, we find that LLMs struggle to replicate our human annotator labels, attributable in large part to how LLMs reflect mainstream views of misogyny. We discuss implications for the use of LLMs for the purposes of misogyny detection."}

These systems differ fundamentally from traditional machine learning models, both in architecture and deployment, introducing unique AI safety challenges, including goal misalignment, compounding decision errors, and coordination risks among interacting agents, that necessitate embedding interpretability and explainability by design to ensure traceability and accountability across their autonomous behaviors. Current interpretability techniques, developed primarily for static models, show limitations when applied to agentic systems. The temporal dynamics, compounding decisions, and context-dependent behaviors of agentic systems demand new analytical approaches. This paper assesses the suitability and limitations of existing interpretability methods in the context of agentic systems, identifying gaps in their capacity to provide meaningful insight into agent decision-making. We propose future directions for developing interpretability techniques specifically designed for agentic systems, pinpointing where interpretability is required to embed oversight mechanisms across the agent lifecycle from goal formation, through environmental interaction, to outcome evaluation. These advances are essential to ensure the safe and accountable deployment of agentic AI systems."}

In LLM-based agentic workflows, such violations can propagate and amplify along reasoning chains, causing task failures and system incidents. This paper presents NSVIF, a neuro-symbolic framework for verifying whether an LLM's output follows the instructions used to prompt the LLM. NSVIF is a universal, general-purpose verifier; it makes no assumption about the instruction or the LLM. NSVIF formulates instruction-following verification as a constraint-satisfaction problem by modeling user instructions as constraints. NSVIF models both logical and semantic constraints; constraint solving is done by a unified solver that orchestrates logical reasoning and semantic analysis. To evaluate NSVIF, we develop VIFBENCH, a new benchmark for instruction-following verifiers with fine-grained data labels. Experiments show that NSVIF significantly outperforms LLM-based approaches and provides interpretable feedback. We also show that feedback from NSVIF helps improve LLMs' instruction-following capability without post-training."}

This paper provides empirical validation of this framework through three experiments. First, we demonstrate the equivalence between recursive Datalog rules and iterative tensor contractions by computing the transitive closure of a biblical genealogy graph containing 1,972 individuals and 1,727 parent-child relationships, converging in 74 iterations to discover 33,945 ancestor relationships.

Using Domingos's relation matrix formulation $R_r = E^\\top A_r E$, we achieve MRR of 0.3068 on standard link prediction and MRR of 0.3346 on a compositional reasoning benchmark where direct edges are removed during training, demonstrating that matrix composition enables multi-hop inference without direct training examples."}

We propose a broadly applicable, step-by-step methodology that connects core technical concepts (e.g., information entropy, network security) with fine arts practices such as music, video production, gaming, and performing arts (e.g., Oxford-style debates). The methodology was applied in several computer science courses at technical universities, where quantitative and qualitative assessments, including student questionnaires and exam scores, showed improved learning outcomes and increased student engagement compared to traditional methods. The results indicate that this art-based integration can effectively bridge the historical divide between the two schools of thought, offering a practical direction for educators.

In practical deployments, workloads span lightweight OCR to complex multimodal reasoning; using one MLLM for all queries either over-provisions compute on easy instances or sacrifices accuracy on hard ones. Query-level model selection (routing) addresses this tension, but extending routing from text-only LLMs to MLLMs is nontrivial due to modality fusion, wide variation in computational cost across models, and the absence of a standardized, budget-aware evaluation. We present MMR-Bench, a unified benchmark that isolates the multimodal routing problem and enables comparison under fixed candidate sets and cost models. MMR-Bench provides (i) a controlled environment with modality-aware inputs and variable compute budgets, (ii) a broad suite of vision-language tasks covering OCR, general VQA, and multimodal math reasoning, and (iii) strong single-model reference, oracle upper bounds, and representative routing policies. Using MMR-Bench, we show that incorporating multimodal signals improves routing quality. Empirically, these cues improve the cost-accuracy frontier and enable the routed system to exceed the strongest single model's accuracy at roughly 33% of its cost. Furthermore, policies trained on a subset of models and tasks generalize zero-shot to new datasets and text-only benchmarks without retuning, establishing MMR-Bench as a foundation for studying adaptive multimodal model selection and efficient MLLM deployment.

In this paper we discuss a potential pathway for building an Ethical Risk Scoring (ERS) system to quantitatively assess the ethical integrity of the data harnessing process for AI systems. This system is based on a set of assessment questions grounded in core ethical principles, which are, in turn, supported by commanding ethical theories. By integrating measurable scoring mechanisms, this approach aims to foster responsible LLM development, balancing technological innovation with ethical accountability."}

While fully automated vehicles are expected to improve traffic stability, efficiency, and sustainability, recent studies suggest that partially automated vehicles, such as those equipped with adaptive cruise control (ACC), may adversely affect traffic flow. These drawbacks may not extend to ACC-enabled EVs due to their distinct mechanical characteristics, including regenerative braking and smoother torque delivery. As a result, the impacts of EVs operating under ACC remain insufficiently understood.\n  To address this gap, this study develops an empirical framework using the OpenACC dataset to compare ACC-enabled EVs and internal combustion engine vehicles. Dynamic time warping aligns comparable lead-vehicle trajectories. Results show that EVs exhibit smoother speed profiles, lower speed variability, and shorter spacing, leading to higher efficiency. EVs reduce critical safety events by over 85% and lower platoon-level emissions by up to 26.2%."}

IGFT combines online Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with information-theoretic rewards, enabling models to learn from self-generated conversations with simulated patients. Unlike existing approaches that rely on expensive expert-annotated conversations or static datasets, our online RL framework allows models to discover effective questioning strategies through exploration. Our key innovation is an information gain reward function that tracks which clinical entities such as symptoms, temporal patterns, and medical history, are revealed during conversation. Each question's reward is computed based on its expected information gain combined with GPT-4o-mini quality assessments across dimensions including clinical relevance, patient engagement, and specificity. This hybrid approach ensures models learn to ask targeted, clinically appropriate questions that efficiently gather diagnostic information. We fine-tune two models using LoRA: Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B (a reasoning-optimized model). Training exclusively on Avey data containing concise HPIs, we evaluate generalization to MIMIC data with longer, more elaborate HPIs. DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B (IGFT) achieves F1 scores of 0.408 on Avey (10.9% improvement over base) and 0.289 on MIMIC (12.9% improvement), while Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct (IGFT) reaches 0.384 and 0.336 respectively. Both models outperform OpenAI's model on MIMIC and surpass medical domain-specific baselines like HuatuoGPT and UltraMedical, which were optimized for single-turn medical QA rather than multi-turn conversations."}

To study this phenomenon, we introduce PS-Bench, a benchmark designed to identify and quantify intent legitimation in personalized interactions. Across multiple memory-augmented agent frameworks and base LLMs, personalization increases attack success rates by 15.8%-243.7% relative to stateless baselines. We further provide mechanistic evidence for intent legitimation from internal representations space, and propose a lightweight detection-reflection method that effectively reduces safety degradation.

We develop a minimal and calibratable theory that predicts these regimes from three binding constraints of modern agent stacks: finite context windows, lossy inter-agent communication, and shared failures among similar agents. Each leaf agent is summarized by a compute-performance scaling exponent $β$; communication is captured by a message-length fidelity curve $γ(m)$; dependence is captured by an effective shared-error correlation $ρ$; and a context window $W$ imposes hard fan-in limits that make hierarchy necessary. For binary success/failure tasks with majority aggregation, we prove a sharp phase transition for deep $b$-ary trees with correlated inputs and lossy communication: a single scalar $α_ρ$ (combining $γ(m)$, $ρ$, and fan-in $b$) determines whether weak signal is amplified to a nontrivial fixed point or washed out to chance. In the amplifying regime, we derive an organization exponent $s$ and show that budgeted synergy, i.e., outperforming the best single agent under the same total budget, occurs exactly when $s>β$, yielding closed-form compute allocation rules and explicit budget thresholds. We further characterize saturation via a mixing depth and provide a conservative clipped predictor that remains accurate across growth and saturation. A continuous-performance warm-up gives closed-form risks for star, chain, and tree organizations, making correlation- and communication-induced floors explicit and exposing the core design trade-offs in a smooth setting. Finally, we validate the predicted phase boundaries in controlled synthetic simulations and show how the same mechanisms explain the dominant bottlenecks reported in recent large-scale matched-budget studies of LLM agent-system scaling."}

Using data from N mock jurors who completed pre-trial attitudinal questionnaires and rendered verdicts in a standardized wrongful-termination case, we compared predictions made by professional jury consultants with those generated by Random Forest (RF) and k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifiers. Model and consultant predictions were evaluated on a held-out test set using paired statistical tests and nonparametric bootstrap procedures. We find that supervised ML models significantly outperform professional jury consultants under identical informational constraints, while offering greater transparency, replicability, and auditability.

Formulated as a latent variable model, UniCog encodes diverse abilities from dense model activations into sparse, disentangled latent dimensions. Through extensive analysis on six advanced LLMs, including DeepSeek-V3.2 and GPT-4o, we reveal a Pareto principle of LLM cognition, where a shared reasoning core is complemented by ability-specific signatures. Furthermore, we discover that reasoning failures often manifest as anomalous intensity in latent activations. These findings opens a new paradigm in LLM analysis, providing a cognition grounded view of reasoning dynamics.

The principal objective is to assess how artificial intelligence augments implementation of instruments grounded in IHR 2005 and the WHO FCTC while identifying doctrinal and infrastructural bottlenecks. Using comparative doctrinal analysis and legal-normative mapping, the study triangulates legislative instruments, WHO monitoring frameworks, AI systems including BlueDot, Aarogya Setu and EIOS, and compliance metrics. Preliminary results show that AI has improved early detection, surveillance precision and responsiveness in high-capacity jurisdictions, whereas LMICs face infrastructural deficits, data privacy gaps and fragmented legal scaffolding.

These investigations exhibit hidden dependency structure: entities interact, signals co-vary, and the importance of a fact may only become clear after other evidence is discovered. Because the context window is bounded, agents must summarize intermediate findings before their significance is known, increasing the risk of discarding key evidence. ReAct-style agents are especially brittle in this regime. Their retrieve-summarize-reason loop makes conclusions sensitive to exploration order and introduces run-to-run non-determinism, producing a reliability gap where Pass-at-k may be high but Majority-at-k remains low. Simply sampling more rollouts or generating longer reasoning traces does not reliably stabilize results, since hypotheses cannot be autonomously checked as new evidence arrives and there is no explicit mechanism for belief bookkeeping and revision. In addition, ReAct entangles semantic reasoning with controller duties such as tool orchestration and state tracking, so execution errors and plan drift degrade reasoning while consuming scarce context.\n  We address these issues by formulating investigation as abductive reasoning over a dependency graph and proposing EoG (Explanations over Graphs), a disaggregated framework in which an LLM performs bounded local evidence mining and labeling (cause vs symptom) while a deterministic controller manages traversal, state, and belief propagation to compute a minimal explanatory frontier. On a representative ITBench diagnostics task, EoG improves both accuracy and run-to-run consistency over ReAct baselines, including a 7x average gain in Majority-at-k entity F1."}

We formalize AGI axiomatically as a distributional, resource-bounded semantic predicate, indexed by a task family, a task distribution, a performance functional, and explicit resource budgets. Under this framework, we derive four classes of results. First, we show that generality is inherently relational: there is no distribution-independent notion of AGI. Second, we prove non-invariance results demonstrating that arbitrarily small perturbations of the task distribution can invalidate AGI properties via cliff sets, precluding universal robustness. Third, we establish bounded transfer guarantees, ruling out unbounded generalization across task families under finite resources. Fourth, invoking Rice-style and Gödel--Tarski arguments, we prove that AGI is a nontrivial semantic property and therefore cannot be soundly and completely certified by any computable procedure, including procedures implemented by the agent itself. Consequently, recursive self-improvement schemes that rely on internal self-certification of AGI are ill-posed. Taken together, our results show that strong, distribution-independent claims of AGI are not false but undefined without explicit formal indexing, and that empirical progress in AI does not imply the attainability of self-certifying general intelligence."}

However, we find that existing specificity evaluation protocols are inadequate for this purpose. We systematically elaborated on the three fundamental issues it faces. Beyond the conceptual issues, we further empirically demonstrate that existing specificity metrics are weakly correlated with the strength of specificity regularizers. We also find that current metrics lack sufficient sensitivity, rendering them ineffective at distinguishing the specificity performance of different methods. Finally, we propose a constructive evaluation protocol. Under this protocol, the conflict between open-ended LLMs and the assumption of determined answers is eliminated, query-independent fluency biases are avoided, and the evaluation strictness can be smoothly adjusted within a near-continuous space. Experiments across various LLMs, datasets, and editing methods show that metrics derived from the proposed protocol are more sensitive to changes in the strength of specificity regularizers and exhibit strong correlation with them, enabling more fine-grained discrimination of different methods' knowledge preservation capabilities."}

This factorization improves sample efficiency by reducing the burden on any single policy and supports selective post-training: when the environment shifts from Phase 1 to Phase 2, only a subset of skills must be adapted, while upstream skills remain transferable.

In this study, we propose a Single-Agent Self-Refinement with Ensemble Voting (SSEV) pipeline built on PET-SQL that operates without ground-truth data, integrating self-refinement with Weighted Majority Voting (WMV) and its randomized variant (RWMA). Experimental results show that the SSEV achieves competitive performance across multiple benchmarks, attaining execution accuracies of 85.5% on Spider 1.0-Dev, 86.4% on Spider 1.0-Test, and 66.3% on BIRD-Dev. Building on insights from the SSEV pipeline, we further propose ReCAPAgent-SQL (Refinement-Critique-Act-Plan agent-based SQL framework) to address the growing complexity of enterprise databases and real-world Text-to-SQL tasks. The framework integrates multiple specialized agents for planning, external knowledge retrieval, critique, action generation, self-refinement, schema linking, and result validation, enabling iterative refinement of SQL predictions through agent collaboration. ReCAPAgent-SQL's WMA results achieve 31% execution accuracy on the first 100 queries of Spider 2.0-Lite, demonstrating significant improvements in handling real-world enterprise scenarios. Overall, our work facilitates the deployment of scalable Text-to-SQL systems in practical settings, supporting better data-driven decision-making at lower cost and with greater efficiency."}

We study disability aware descriptions for person centric images, where models often transition from evidence grounded factual description to interpretation shift including introduction of unsupported inferences beyond observable visual evidence. To systematically analyze this phenomenon, we introduce a benchmark based on paired Neutral Prompts (NP) and Disability-Contextualised Prompts (DP) and evaluate 15 state-of-the-art open- and closed-source VLMs under a zero-shot setting across 9 disability categories. Our evaluation framework treats interpretive fidelity as core objective and combines standard text-based metrics capturing affective degradation through shifts in sentiment, social regard and response length with an LLM-as-judge protocol, validated by annotators with lived experience of disability. We find that introducing disability context consistently degrades interpretive fidelity, inducing interpretation shifts characterised by speculative inference, narrative elaboration, affective degradation and deficit oriented framing. These effects are further amplified along race and gender dimension. Finally, we demonstrate targeted prompting and preference fine-tuning effectively improves interpretive fidelity and reduces substantially interpretation shifts."}

Yet while these calls are crucial for accountability, current transparency policies often fall short of their intended aims. Similar to nutrition facts for food, policies aimed at nutrition facts for AI currently suffer from a limited consideration of research on effective disclosures. We offer an institutional perspective and identify three common fallacies in policy implementations of data disclosures for AI. First, many data transparency proposals exhibit a specification gap between the stated goals of data transparency and the actual disclosures necessary to achieve such goals. Second, reform attempts exhibit an enforcement gap between required disclosures on paper and enforcement to ensure compliance in fact. Third, policy proposals manifest an impact gap between disclosed information and meaningful changes in developer practices and public understanding. Informed by the social science on transparency, our analysis identifies affirmative paths for transparency that are effective rather than merely symbolic."}

Across thousands of interactions over multiple base models and evaluators, Sentipolis improves emotionally grounded behavior, boosting communication, and emotional continuity. Gains are model-dependent: believability increases for higher-capacity models but can drop for smaller ones, and emotion-awareness can mildly reduce adherence to social norms, reflecting a human-like tension between emotion-driven behavior and rule compliance in social simulation. Network-level diagnostics show reciprocal, moderately clustered, and temporally stable relationship structures, supporting the study of cumulative social dynamics such as alliance formation and gradual relationship change."}

Doumas"], "title": "Using psychological theory to ground guidelines for the annotation of misogynistic language", "comment": null, "summary": "Detecting misogynistic hate speech is a difficult algorithmic task. The task is made more difficult when decision criteria for what constitutes misogynistic speech are ungrounded in established literatures in psychology and philosophy, both of which have described in great detail the forms explicit and subtle misogynistic attitudes can take. In particular, the literature on algorithmic detection of misogynistic speech often rely on guidelines that are insufficiently robust or inappropriately justified -- they often fail to include various misogynistic phenomena or misrepresent their importance when they do. As a result, current misogyny detection coding schemes and datasets fail to capture the ways women experience misogyny online. This is of pressing importance: misogyny is on the rise both online and offline. Thus, the scientific community needs to have a systematic, theory informed coding scheme of misogyny detection and a corresponding dataset to train and test models of misogyny detection. To this end, we developed (1) a misogyny annotation guideline scheme informed by theoretical and empirical psychological research, (2) annotated a new dataset achieving substantial inter-rater agreement (kappa = 0.68) and (3) present a case study using Large Language Models (LLMs) to compare our coding scheme to a self-described \"expert\" misogyny annotation scheme in the literature. Our findings indicate that our guideline scheme surpasses the other coding scheme in the classification of misogynistic texts across 3 datasets. Additionally, we find that LLMs struggle to replicate our human annotator labels, attributable in large part to how LLMs reflect mainstream views of misogyny. We discuss implications for the use of LLMs for the purposes of misogyny detection."}

Yet analyses typically operationalize this set-level inquiry using item-level evidence: pairwise comparisons among exemplars. That unit-of-analysis mismatch may be manageable for finite corpora of human-created works, where it can be bridged by ad hoc aggregations. But it becomes acute for machine-generated works, where the object of evaluation is not a fixed set of works but a generative process with an effectively unbounded output space. We propose a distributional alternative: a two-sample test based on maximum mean discrepancy computed on semantic embeddings to determine if two creative processes-whether human or machine-produce statistically distinguishable output distributions. The test requires no task-specific training-obviating the need for discovery of proprietary training data to characterize the generative process-and is sample-efficient, often detecting differences with as few as 5-10 images and 7-20 texts. We validate the framework across three domains: handwritten digits (controlled images), patent abstracts (text), and AI-generated art (real-world images). We reveal a perceptual paradox: even when human evaluators distinguish AI outputs from human-created art with only about 58% accuracy, our method detects distributional distinctiveness. Our results present evidence contrary to the view that generative models act as mere regurgitators of training data. Rather than producing outputs statistically indistinguishable from a human baseline-as simple regurgitation would predict-they produce outputs that are semantically human-like yet stochastically distinct, suggesting their dominant function is as a semantic interpolator within a learned latent space."}

We tested this assumption in mental health, where high safety stakes make expert consensus essential. Three certified psychiatrists independently evaluated LLM-generated responses using a calibrated rubric. Despite similar training and shared instructions, inter-rater reliability was consistently poor ($ICC$ $0.087$--$0.295$), falling below thresholds considered acceptable for consequential assessment. Disagreement was highest on the most safety-critical items. Suicide and self-harm responses produced greater divergence than any other category, and was systematic rather than random. One factor yielded negative reliability (Krippendorff's $α= -0.203$), indicating structured disagreement worse than chance. Qualitative interviews revealed that disagreement reflects coherent but incompatible individual clinical frameworks, safety-first, engagement-centered, and culturally-informed orientations, rather than measurement error. By demonstrating that experts rely on holistic risk heuristics rather than granular factor discrimination, these findings suggest that aggregated labels function as arithmetic compromises that effectively erase grounded professional philosophies. Our results characterize expert disagreement in safety-critical AI as a sociotechnical phenomenon where professional experience introduces sophisticated layers of principled divergence. We discuss implications for reward modeling, safety classification, and evaluation benchmarks, recommending that practitioners shift from consensus-based aggregation to alignment methods that preserve and learn from expert disagreement."}

Through extensive experiments of testing SOTA LLMs on a new syllogism dataset, we have some interesting findings: (i) Model size scaling promotes the shift toward modern logic; (ii) Thinking serves as an efficient accelerator beyond parameter scaling; (iii) the Base model plays a crucial role in determining how easily and stably this shift can emerge.

Findings show that 93% of respondents actively use GenAI primarily for text-based tasks, while more advanced uses such as programming or multimodal generation are less common. Despite the prevalence of use, overall awareness and conceptual understanding remain uneven, with many reporting limited technical knowledge.

Our analysis shows significant inconsistencies in methodologies and lack of technical depth when evaluating AI-powered systems. To enhance the depth, scale, and independence of compliance assessments, we propose to employ algorithmic auditing -- a process of behavioural assessment of AI algorithms by means of simulating user behaviour, observing algorithm responses and analysing them for audited phenomena."}

The methodology was applied in several computer science courses at technical universities, where quantitative and qualitative assessments, including student questionnaires and exam scores, showed improved learning outcomes and increased student engagement compared to traditional methods. The results indicate that this art-based integration can effectively bridge the historical divide between the two schools of thought, offering a practical direction for educators.

Existing methods employ LLM judges to filter responses, yet still require all models to perform inference before judging, failing to cut costs effectively. They also lack model selection criteria and struggle with large model pools, where full inference is costly and can exceed context limits. To address this, we propose RouteMoA, an efficient mixture-of-agents framework with dynamic routing. It employs a lightweight scorer to perform initial screening by predicting coarse-grained performance from the query, narrowing candidates to a high-potential subset without inference. A mixture of judges then refines these scores through lightweight self- and cross-assessment based on existing model outputs, providing posterior correction without additional inference. Finally, a model ranking mechanism selects models by balancing performance, cost, and latency. RouteMoA outperforms MoA across varying tasks and model pool sizes, reducing cost by 89.8% and latency by 63.6% in the large-scale model pool."}

At the initial clinical encounters, physicians assess rare disease risk using only limited information under high uncertainty. When high-risk patients are not recognised at this stage, targeted diagnostic testing is often not initiated, resulting in missed diagnosis. Existing primary care triage processes are structurally insufficient to reliably identify patients with rare diseases at initial clinical presentation and universal screening is needed to reduce diagnostic delay. Here we present RareAlert, an early screening system which predict patient-level rare disease risk from routinely available primary-visit information. RareAlert integrates reasoning generated by ten LLMs, calibrates and weights these signals using machine learning, and distils the aligned reasoning into a single locally deployable model. To develop and evaluate RareAlert, we curated RareBench, a real-world dataset of 158,666 cases covering 33 Orphanet disease categories and more than 7,000 rare conditions, including both rare and non-rare presentations. The results showed that rare disease identification can be reconceptualised as a universal uncertainty resolution process applied to the general patient population. On an independent test set, RareAlert, a Qwen3-4B based model trained with calibrated reasoning signals, achieved an AUC of 0.917, outperforming the best machine learning ensemble and all evaluated LLMs, including GPT-5, DeepSeek-R1, Claude-3.7-Sonnet, o3-mini, Gemini-2.5-Pro, and Qwen3-235B. These findings demonstrate the diversity in LLM medical reasoning and the effectiveness of aligning such reasoning in highly uncertain clinical tasks. By incorporating calibrated reasoning into a single model, RareAlert enables accurate, privacy-preserving, and scalable rare disease risk screening suitable for large-scale local deployment."}

Incentives and Governance of AI-Generated Content", "comment": null, "summary": "Generative artificial intelligence (Gen-AI) is reshaping content creation on digital platforms by reducing production costs and enabling scalable output of varying quality. In response, platforms have begun adopting disclosure policies that require creators to label AI-generated content, often supported by imperfect detection and penalties for non-compliance. This paper develops a formal model to study the economic implications of such disclosure regimes. We compare a non-disclosure benchmark, in which the platform alone detects AI usage, with a mandatory self-disclosure regime in which creators strategically choose whether to disclose or conceal AI use under imperfect enforcement. The model incorporates heterogeneous creators, viewer discounting of AI-labeled content, trust penalties following detected non-disclosure, and endogenous enforcement. The analysis shows that disclosure is optimal only when both the value of AI-generated content and its cost-saving advantage are intermediate. As AI capability improves, the platform's optimal enforcement strategy evolves from strict deterrence to partial screening and eventual deregulation. While disclosure reliably increases transparency, it reduces aggregate creator surplus and can suppress high-quality AI content when AI is technologically advanced. Overall, the results characterize disclosure as a strategic governance instrument whose effectiveness depends on technological maturity and trust frictions."}

To address this, we introduce DeepPlanning, a challenging benchmark for practical long-horizon agent planning. It features multi-day travel planning and multi-product shopping tasks that require proactive information acquisition, local constrained reasoning, and global constrained optimization. Evaluations on DeepPlanning show that even frontier agentic LLMs struggle with these problems, highlighting the importance of reliable explicit reasoning patterns and parallel tool use for achieving better effectiveness-efficiency trade-offs.

This principle appears under many names -- rejection sampling with SFT, goal-conditioned RL, Decision Transformers -- yet what optimization problem it solves, if any, has remained unclear. We prove that success conditioning exactly solves a trust-region optimization problem, maximizing policy improvement subject to a $χ^2$ divergence constraint whose radius is determined automatically by the data. This yields an identity: relative policy improvement, the magnitude of policy change, and a quantity we call action-influence -- measuring how random variation in action choices affects success rates -- are exactly equal at every state. Success conditioning thus emerges as a conservative improvement operator. Exact success conditioning cannot degrade performance or induce dangerous distribution shift, but when it fails, it does so observably, by hardly changing the policy at all. We apply our theory to the common practice of return thresholding, showing this can amplify improvement, but at the cost of potential misalignment with the true objective."}

The standard trial-and-error approach to find feasible parameter configurations is highly inefficient because validating each configuration is expensive in terms of resources (physical and human labor) and the configuration space is very large. This paper combines the general principles of AI-driven adaptive experimental design with domain knowledge to address the challenging problem of discovering feasible configurations. The key idea is to build a surrogate model from past experiments to intelligently select a small batch of input configurations for validation in each iteration. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this methodology, we deploy it for Directed Energy Deposition process to print GRCop--42, a high-performance copper--chromium--niobium alloy developed by NASA for aerospace applications. Within three months, our approach yielded multiple defect-free outputs across a range of laser powers dramatically reducing time to result and resource expenditure compared to several months of manual experimentation by domain scientists with no success. By enabling high-quality GRCop--42 fabrication on readily available infrared laser platforms for the first time, we democratize access to this critical alloy, paving the way for cost-effective, decentralized production for aerospace applications."}

Specifically, we train an Intuitive Critic Model (ICM) using positive and negative action examples from a base agent first. This critic evaluates the immediate correctness of the agent's intended actions, thereby selecting operations with higher success probability. Then, the initial critic guides agent actions to collect refined positive/negative samples, initiating the self-improving cycle. The augmented data then trains a second-round critic with enhanced discernment capability. We conduct experiments on various datasets and demonstrate that the proposed ICM can improve the test-time performance of various closed-source and open-source models, and the performance can be gradually improved as the data is recycled.

In the context of Chinese law, the feasibility of such agreements depends not on replicating foreign models, but on establishing three interpretive mechanisms: expanding the functional definition of \"same category\" claims; adopting a hybrid registration/confirmation system for indeterminate class membership; and converting the \"consent\" requirement under Article 57, Paragraph 3 of the Civil Procedure Law into a workable opt-out right subject to judicial scrutiny."}

In this work, we investigate the challenge of agentic post-training when the eventual test domains are unknown. Specifically, we analyze which properties of reinforcement learning (RL) environments and modeling choices have the greatest influence on out-of-domain performance. First, we identify two environment axes that strongly correlate with cross-domain generalization: (i) state information richness, i.e., the amount of information for the agent to process from the state, and (ii) planning complexity, estimated via goal reachability and trajectory length under a base policy. Notably, domain realism and text-level similarity are not the primary factors; for instance, the simple grid-world domain Sokoban leads to even stronger generalization in SciWorld than the more realistic ALFWorld. Motivated by these findings, we further show that increasing state information richness alone can already effectively improve cross-domain robustness. We propose a randomization technique, which is low-overhead and broadly applicable: add small amounts of distractive goal-irrelevant features to the state to make it richer without altering the task. Beyond environment-side properties, we also examine several modeling choices: (a) SFT warmup or mid-training helps prevent catastrophic forgetting during RL but undermines generalization to domains that are not included in the mid-training datamix; and (b) turning on step-by-step thinking during RL, while not always improving in-domain performance, plays a crucial role in preserving generalization."}

This approach treats sequential task interactions as a continuous stream of experience, enabling the system to distill short-term execution feedback into long-term, reusable capabilities without access to ground-truth labels.

Our method introduces a universal \"think\" parameter augmentation that enables models to articulate their decision-making process, with dynamic optimization for parameter descriptions to improve reasoning quality.

To address this limitation, we introduce SQL-Trail, a multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL) agentic framework for Text-to-SQL. Rather than producing a query in one shot, SQL-Trail interacts with the database environment and uses execution feedback to iteratively refine its predictions. Our approach centers on two key ideas: (i) an adaptive turn-budget allocation mechanism that scales the agent's interaction depth to match question difficulty, and (ii) a composite reward panel that jointly incentivizes SQL correctness and efficient exploration.

By transforming data from a scarce resource into a controllable asset, LLMs mitigate the bottlenecks imposed by the acquisition costs of real-world data for model training, evaluation, and system iteration. However, ensuring the high quality of LLM-generated synthetic data remains a critical challenge. Existing research primarily focuses on generation methodologies, with limited direct attention to the quality of the resulting data. Furthermore, most studies are restricted to single modalities, lacking a unified perspective across different data types. To bridge this gap, we propose the \\textbf{LLM Data Auditor framework}. In this framework, we first describe how LLMs are utilized to generate data across six distinct modalities. More importantly, we systematically categorize intrinsic metrics for evaluating synthetic data from two dimensions: quality and trustworthiness. This approach shifts the focus from extrinsic evaluation, which relies on downstream task performance, to the inherent properties of the data itself. Using this evaluation system, we analyze the experimental evaluations of representative generation methods for each modality and identify substantial deficiencies in current evaluation practices. Based on these findings, we offer concrete recommendations for the community to improve the evaluation of data generation. Finally, the framework outlines methodologies for the practical application of synthetic data across different modalities."}

To understand this better, we conducted a behavioral experiment where 28 MFA writers (experts) competed against three LLMs in emulating 50 critically acclaimed authors. Based on blind pairwise comparisons by 28 expert judges and 131 lay judges, we find that experts preferred human writing in 82.7% of cases under the in-context prompting condition but this reversed to 62% preference for AI after fine-tuning on authors' complete works. Lay judges, however, consistently preferred AI writing. Debrief interviews with expert writers revealed that their preference for AI writing triggered an identity crisis, eroding aesthetic confidence and questioning what constitutes \"good writing.\" These findings challenge discourse about AI's creative limitations and raise fundamental questions about the future of creative labor."}

Enterprise systems pose distinct challenges, including high-density user interfaces, strict business logic constraints, and a strong reliance on precise, state-consistent information retrieval-settings in which current generalist agents often struggle. To address this gap, we introduce EntWorld, a large-scale benchmark consisting of 1,756 tasks across six representative enterprise domains, including customer relationship management (CRM), information technology infrastructure library (ITIL), and enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. Unlike previous datasets that depend on fragile execution traces or extensive manual annotation, EntWorld adopts a schema-grounded task generation framework that directly reverse-engineers business logic from underlying database schemas, enabling the synthesis of realistic, long-horizon workflows. Moreover, we propose a SQL-based deterministic verification mechanism in building datasets that replaces ambiguous visual matching with rigorous state-transition validation. Experimental results demonstrate that state-of-the-art models (e.g., GPT-4.1) achieve 47.61% success rate on EntWorld, substantially lower than the human performance, highlighting a pronounced enterprise gap in current agentic capabilities and the necessity of developing domain-specific agents. We release EntWorld as a rigorous testbed to facilitate the development and evaluation of the next generation of enterprise-ready digital agents."}

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and open-source Large Language Models are combined through multi-stage iterative workflows in the system's hybrid LangGraph architecture. The agent constructs an extensive Devito knowledge graph through document parsing, structure-aware segmentation, extraction of entity relationships, and Leiden-based community detection. GraphRAG optimisation enhances query performance across semantic communities that include seismic wave simulation, computational fluid dynamics, and performance tuning libraries. A reverse engineering component derives three-level query strategies for RAG retrieval through static analysis of Fortran source code. To deliver precise contextual information for language model guidance, the multi-stage retrieval pipeline performs parallel searching, concept expansion, community-scale retrieval, and semantic similarity analysis. Code synthesis is governed by Pydantic-based constraints to guarantee structured outputs and reliability. A comprehensive validation framework integrates conventional static analysis with the G-Eval approach, covering execution correctness, structural soundness, mathematical consistency, and API compliance. The overall agent workflow is implemented on the LangGraph framework and adopts concurrent processing to support quality-based iterative refinement and state-aware dynamic routing. The principal contribution lies in the incorporation of feedback mechanisms motivated by reinforcement learning, enabling a transition from static code translation toward dynamic and adaptive analytical behavior."}

However, generating such features is challenging: it requires reasoning over complex schemas and exploring a combinatorially large feature space, all without explicit supervision. To address these challenges, we propose ReFuGe, an agentic framework that leverages specialized large language model agents: (1) a schema selection agent identifies the tables and columns relevant to the task, (2) a feature generation agent produces diverse candidate features from the selected schema, and (3) a feature filtering agent evaluates and retains promising features through reasoning-based and validation-based filtering. It operates within an iterative feedback loop until performance converges. Experiments on RDB benchmarks demonstrate that ReFuGe substantially improves performance on various RDB prediction tasks.

Building on this observation, we propose Dynamic Thinking-Token Selection (DynTS). This method identifies decision-critical tokens and retains only their associated Key-Value (KV) cache states during inference, evicting the remaining redundant entries to optimize efficiency."}

Yet most agent stacks provide no mandatory execution checkpoint where organizations can deterministically permit, deny, or defer an action before it changes reality. This paper introduces Faramesh, a protocol-agnostic execution control plane that enforces execution-time authorization for agent-driven actions via a non-bypassable Action Authorization Boundary (AAB). Faramesh canonicalizes agent intent into a Canonical Action Representation (CAR), evaluates actions deterministically against policy and state, and issues a decision artifact (PERMIT/DEFER/DENY) that executors must validate prior to execution. The system is designed to be framework- and model-agnostic, supports multi-agent and multi-tenant deployments, and remains independent of transport protocols (e.g., MCP). Faramesh further provides decision-centric, append-only provenance logging keyed by canonical action hashes, enabling auditability, verification, and deterministic replay without re-running agent reasoning. We show how these primitives yield enforceable, predictable governance for autonomous execution while avoiding hidden coupling to orchestration layers or observability-only approaches."}

In this paper, we demonstrate that expensive online reinforcement learning is not all you need to build powerful research agents. To bridge this gap, we introduce a fully open-source suite designed for effective offline training. Our core contributions include DeepForge, a ready-to-use task synthesis framework that generates large-scale research queries without heavy preprocessing; and a curated collection of 66k QA pairs, 33k SFT trajectories, and 21k DPO pairs.

This study addresses that gap by empirically assessing whether jury consultants can reliably predict juror predispositions beyond chance levels and whether supervised machine-learning (ML) models can outperform consultant predictions. Using data from N mock jurors who completed pre-trial attitudinal questionnaires and rendered verdicts in a standardized wrongful-termination case, we compared predictions made by professional jury consultants with those generated by Random Forest (RF) and k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifiers. Model and consultant predictions were evaluated on a held-out test set using paired statistical tests and nonparametric bootstrap procedures. We find that supervised ML models significantly outperform professional jury consultants under identical informational constraints, while offering greater transparency, replicability, and auditability. These results provide an empirical benchmark for evaluating human judgment in jury selection and inform ongoing debates about the role of data-driven decision support in legal contexts.

DeepResearch (DR) models ground outputs in verifiable evidence from tools and perform strongly in general domains, but their direct transfer to medical field yields relatively limited gains. We attribute this to two gaps: task characteristic and tool-use scaling. Medical questions require evidence interpretation in a knowledge-intensive clinical context; while general DR models can retrieve information, they often lack clinical-context reasoning and thus \"find it but fail to use it,\" leaving performance limited by medical abilities. Moreover, in medical scenarios, blindly scaling tool-call can inject noisy context, derailing sensitive medical reasoning and prompting repetitive evidence-seeking along incorrect paths. Therefore, we propose DeepMed. For data, we deploy a multi-hop med-search QA synthesis method supporting the model to apply the DR paradigm in medical contexts. For training, we introduce a difficulty-aware turn-penalty to suppress excessive tool-call growth. For inference, we bring a monitor to help validate hypotheses within a controlled number of steps and avoid context rot.

In this paper, we propose a framework for modeling historical dynamics as stochastic processes described by stochastic differential equations (SDEs). By viewing historical change through the lens of continuous-time dynamics, this framework provides a natural language to describe how structural trends and inherent random fluctuations interact to shape societal evolution. This approach allows us to handle the uncertainty in fragmentary historical records, moving beyond the dichotomy of structural determinism versus pure chance. We demonstrate that adopting this stochastic perspective unlocks a rich suite of analytical capabilities unavailable to static models. Specifically, we introduce methods to: (1) quantify the irreversibility; (2) detect exogenous perturbations; (3) perform multiple imputation for missing historical records. This framework offers a unified methodology for dissecting the stability, contingency, and dynamics of historical change."}

Our evaluation of five LLMs from different families based on this new benchmark demonstrates that compliance is not a monolithic capability but varies significantly with constraint type, quantity, and position.

In LLM-based agentic workflows, such violations can propagate and amplify along reasoning chains, causing task failures and system incidents. This paper presents NSVIF, a neuro-symbolic framework for verifying whether an LLM's output follows the instructions used to prompt the LLM. NSVIF is a universal, general-purpose verifier; it makes no assumption about the instruction or the LLM. NSVIF formulates instruction-following verification as a constraint-satisfaction problem by modeling user instructions as constraints. NSVIF models both logical and semantic constraints; constraint solving is done by a unified solver that orchestrates logical reasoning and semantic analysis. To evaluate NSVIF, we develop VIFBENCH, a new benchmark for instruction-following verifiers with fine-grained data labels. Experiments show that NSVIF significantly outperforms LLM-based approaches and provides interpretable feedback. We also show that feedback from NSVIF helps improve LLMs' instruction-following capability without post-training."}

In this work, we analyze how stabilizing training dynamics affects the induced generation distribution. We show that under standard maximum likelihood training, stable parameter trajectories lead stationary solutions to approximately minimize the forward KL divergence to the empirical distribution, while implicitly reducing generative entropy. As a consequence, the learned model can concentrate probability mass on a limited subset of empirical modes, exhibiting systematic degeneration despite smooth loss convergence. We empirically validate this effect using a controlled feedback-based training framework that stabilizes internal generation statistics, observing consistent low-entropy outputs and repetitive behavior across architectures and random seeds. It indicates that optimization stability and generative expressivity are not inherently aligned, and that stability alone is an insufficient indicator of generative quality."}

In practical deployments, workloads span lightweight OCR to complex multimodal reasoning; using one MLLM for all queries either over-provisions compute on easy instances or sacrifices accuracy on hard ones. Query-level model selection (routing) addresses this tension, but extending routing from text-only LLMs to MLLMs is nontrivial due to modality fusion, wide variation in computational cost across models, and the absence of a standardized, budget-aware evaluation. We present MMR-Bench, a unified benchmark that isolates the multimodal routing problem and enables comparison under fixed candidate sets and cost models. MMR-Bench provides (i) a controlled environment with modality-aware inputs and variable compute budgets, (ii) a broad suite of vision-language tasks covering OCR, general VQA, and multimodal math reasoning, and (iii) strong single-model reference, oracle upper bounds, and representative routing policies. Using MMR-Bench, we show that incorporating multimodal signals improves routing quality. Empirically, these cues improve the cost-accuracy frontier and enable the routed system to exceed the strongest single model's accuracy at roughly 33% of its cost. Furthermore, policies trained on a subset of models and tasks generalize zero-shot to new datasets and text-only benchmarks without retuning, establishing MMR-Bench as a foundation for studying adaptive multimodal model selection and efficient MLLM deployment.

In this work, we propose a novel method that uses feedback from the logic solver to augment a logic problem with commonsense relations provided by the LLM, in an iterative manner. This involves a search procedure through potential commonsense assumptions to maximize the chance of finding useful facts while keeping cost tractable. On a collection of pure-logical reasoning datasets, from which some commonsense information has been removed, our method consistently achieves considerable improvements over existing techniques, demonstrating the value in balancing neural and symbolic elements when working in human contexts."}

KernelSHAP approximates Shapley values by approximating the game as a linear function, which is fit using a small number of game evaluations for random feature subsets.\n  In this work, we extend KernelSHAP by approximating the game via higher degree polynomials, which capture non-linear interactions between features. Our resulting PolySHAP method yields empirically better Shapley value estimates for various benchmark datasets, and we prove that these estimates are consistent.\n  Moreover, we connect our approach to paired sampling (antithetic sampling), a ubiquitous modification to KernelSHAP that improves empirical accuracy. We prove that paired sampling outputs exactly the same Shapley value approximations as second-order PolySHAP, without ever fitting a degree 2 polynomial. To the best of our knowledge, this finding provides the first strong theoretical justification for the excellent practical performance of the paired sampling heuristic."}

IGFT combines online Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with information-theoretic rewards, enabling models to learn from self-generated conversations with simulated patients. Unlike existing approaches that rely on expensive expert-annotated conversations or static datasets, our online RL framework allows models to discover effective questioning strategies through exploration. Our key innovation is an information gain reward function that tracks which clinical entities such as symptoms, temporal patterns, and medical history, are revealed during conversation. Each question's reward is computed based on its expected information gain combined with GPT-4o-mini quality assessments across dimensions including clinical relevance, patient engagement, and specificity. This hybrid approach ensures models learn to ask targeted, clinically appropriate questions that efficiently gather diagnostic information. We fine-tune two models using LoRA: Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B (a reasoning-optimized model). Training exclusively on Avey data containing concise HPIs, we evaluate generalization to MIMIC data with longer, more elaborate HPIs. DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B (IGFT) achieves F1 scores of 0.408 on Avey (10.9% improvement over base) and 0.289 on MIMIC (12.9% improvement), while Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct (IGFT) reaches 0.384 and 0.336 respectively. Both models outperform OpenAI's model on MIMIC and surpass medical domain-specific baselines like HuatuoGPT and UltraMedical, which were optimized for single-turn medical QA rather than multi-turn conversations."}

Here, we investigate whether and when phonemic, lexical, and syntactic representations emerge in the activations of artificial neural networks during their training. Our results show that both speech- and text-based models follow a sequence of learning stages: during training, their neural activations successively build subspaces, where the geometry of the neural activations represents phonemic, lexical, and syntactic structure. While this developmental trajectory qualitatively relates to children's, it is quantitatively different: These algorithms indeed require two to four orders of magnitude more data for these neural representations to emerge.

The principal objective is to assess how artificial intelligence augments implementation of instruments grounded in IHR 2005 and the WHO FCTC while identifying doctrinal and infrastructural bottlenecks. Using comparative doctrinal analysis and legal-normative mapping, the study triangulates legislative instruments, WHO monitoring frameworks, AI systems including BlueDot, Aarogya Setu and EIOS, and compliance metrics. Preliminary results show that AI has improved early detection, surveillance precision and responsiveness in high-capacity jurisdictions, whereas LMICs face infrastructural deficits, data privacy gaps and fragmented legal scaffolding.

The study argues for embedding AI within a rights-compliant, supranationally coordinated regulatory framework to secure equitable health outcomes and stronger compliance.

While LLMs offer potential for accessible emotional assistance, their reliability, therapeutic relevance, and alignment with human standards remain challenging to address. This paper introduces a human-grounded evaluation methodology designed to assess LLM generated responses in therapeutic dialogue. Our approach involved curating a dataset of 500 mental health conversations from datasets with real-world scenario questions and evaluating the responses generated by nine diverse LLMs, including closed source and open source models. More specifically, these responses were evaluated by two psychiatric trained experts, who independently rated each on a 5 point Likert scale across a comprehensive 6 attribute rubric. This rubric captures Cognitive Support and Affective Resonance, providing a multidimensional perspective on therapeutic quality. Our analysis reveals that LLMs provide strong cognitive reliability by producing safe, coherent, and clinically appropriate information, but they demonstrate unstable affective alignment. Although closed source models (e.g., GPT-4o) offer balanced therapeutic responses, open source models show greater variability and emotional flatness. We reveal a persistent cognitive-affective gap and highlight the need for failure aware, clinically grounded evaluation frameworks that prioritize relational sensitivity alongside informational accuracy in mental health oriented LLMs. We advocate for balanced evaluation protocols with human in the loop that center on therapeutic sensitivity and provide a framework to guide the responsible design and clinical oversight of mental health oriented conversational AI."}

In this paper, we reveal intent legitimation, a previously underexplored safety failure in personalized agents, where benign personal memories bias intent inference and cause models to legitimize inherently harmful queries. To study this phenomenon, we introduce PS-Bench, a benchmark designed to identify and quantify intent legitimation in personalized interactions. Across multiple memory-augmented agent frameworks and base LLMs, personalization increases attack success rates by 15.8%-243.7% relative to stateless baselines. We further provide mechanistic evidence for intent legitimation from internal representations space, and propose a lightweight detection-reflection method that effectively reduces safety degradation.

Effective reasoning, therefore, hinges on knowing which tools to use, when to invoke them, and how to compose them over multiple steps, even when faced with new tools or new tasks. We introduce \\textbf{AdaReasoner}, a family of multimodal models that learn tool use as a general reasoning skill rather than as tool-specific or explicitly supervised behavior. AdaReasoner is enabled by (i) a scalable data curation pipeline exposing models to long-horizon, multi-step tool interactions; (ii) Tool-GRPO, a reinforcement learning algorithm that optimizes tool selection and sequencing based on end-task success; and (iii) an adaptive learning mechanism that dynamically regulates tool usage. Together, these components allow models to infer tool utility from task context and intermediate outcomes, enabling coordination of multiple tools and generalization to unseen tools. Empirically, AdaReasoner exhibits strong tool-adaptive and generalization behaviors: it autonomously adopts beneficial tools, suppresses irrelevant ones, and adjusts tool usage frequency based on task demands, despite never being explicitly trained to do so. These capabilities translate into state-of-the-art performance across challenging benchmarks, improving the 7B base model by +24.9\\% on average and surpassing strong proprietary systems such as GPT-5 on multiple tasks, including VSP and Jigsaw."}

Formulated as a latent variable model, UniCog encodes diverse abilities from dense model activations into sparse, disentangled latent dimensions. Through extensive analysis on six advanced LLMs, including DeepSeek-V3.2 and GPT-4o, we reveal a Pareto principle of LLM cognition, where a shared reasoning core is complemented by ability-specific signatures. Furthermore, we discover that reasoning failures often manifest as anomalous intensity in latent activations. These findings opens a new paradigm in LLM analysis, providing a cognition grounded view of reasoning dynamics.

These investigations exhibit hidden dependency structure: entities interact, signals co-vary, and the importance of a fact may only become clear after other evidence is discovered. Because the context window is bounded, agents must summarize intermediate findings before their significance is known, increasing the risk of discarding key evidence. ReAct-style agents are especially brittle in this regime. Their retrieve-summarize-reason loop makes conclusions sensitive to exploration order and introduces run-to-run non-determinism, producing a reliability gap where Pass-at-k may be high but Majority-at-k remains low. Simply sampling more rollouts or generating longer reasoning traces does not reliably stabilize results, since hypotheses cannot be autonomously checked as new evidence arrives and there is no explicit mechanism for belief bookkeeping and revision. In addition, ReAct entangles semantic reasoning with controller duties such as tool orchestration and state tracking, so execution errors and plan drift degrade reasoning while consuming scarce context.\n  We address these issues by formulating investigation as abductive reasoning over a dependency graph and proposing EoG (Explanations over Graphs), a disaggregated framework in which an LLM performs bounded local evidence mining and labeling (cause vs symptom) while a deterministic controller manages traversal, state, and belief propagation to compute a minimal explanatory frontier. On a representative ITBench diagnostics task, EoG improves both accuracy and run-to-run consistency over ReAct baselines, including a 7x average gain in Majority-at-k entity F1."}

We show that Health-SCORE provides two practical benefits beyond standalone evaluation: it can be used as a structured reward signal to guide reinforcement learning with safety-aware supervision, and it can be incorporated directly into prompts to improve response quality through in-context learning. Across open-ended healthcare tasks, Health-SCORE achieves evaluation quality comparable to human-created rubrics while significantly lowering development effort, making rubric-based evaluation and training more scalable."}

This factorization improves sample efficiency by reducing the burden on any single policy and supports selective post-training: when the environment shifts from Phase 1 to Phase 2, only a subset of skills must be adapted, while upstream skills remain transferable.

Finally, we amplify Indigenous voices by providing a dataset of stories that resist epistemic erasure, along with recommendations for HCI researchers to support Indigenous-led initiatives with cultural sensitivity, accountability, and self-determination."}

Moreover, scholars have reached a consensus on the critical role of self-regulated learning (SRL) in ensuring learning effectiveness within GenAI-assisted learning environments, making it essential to capture students' dynamic SRL patterns. In this study, we extracted students' interaction patterns with GenAI from trace data as they completed a problem-solving task within a GenAI-assisted intelligent tutoring system. Students' purpose of using GenAI was also analyzed from the perspective of information processing, i.e., information acquisition and information transformation. Using sequential and clustering analysis, this study classified participants into two groups based on their SRL sequences. These two groups differed in the frequency and temporal characteristics of GenAI use. In addition, most students used GenAI for information acquisition rather than information transformation, while the correlation between the purpose of using GenAI and learning performance was not statistically significant. Our findings inform both pedagogical design and the development of GenAI-assisted learning environments."}

In this expanded study, a larger dataset of 99 industry responses was collected, with manual labeling to identify fake responses based on logical inconsistencies and response patterns. After preprocessing and label encoding, both Random Forest and baseline models (Logistic Regression, XGBoost) were trained to distinguish genuine from fake responses. The best-performing model achieved an 92.0% accuracy rate, demonstrating improved detection compared to the pilot study. Despite limitations, the results highlight the viability of integrating AI into survey pipelines and provide a scalable solution for improving data integrity in supply chain research, especially during product launch and technology adoption phases."}

The DST monitors supervisors' visual attention allocation in real time and displays visually salient cues if critical changes or events are missed. Twenty-five military students participated in a simulated intelligence task. Results indicated significant performance enhancement when the adaptive DST was present.

While both areas of law have amassed rich and well-developed areas of scholarly work and doctrinal support, a growing body of scholars are interrogating the intersection between them. This Article argues that the issues surrounding algorithmic accountability demonstrate a deeper, more structural tension within a new generation of disputes regarding law and technology. As I argue, the true promise of AI does not lie in the information we reveal to one another, but rather in the questions it raises about the interaction of technology, property, and civil rights. For this reason, I argue that we are looking in the wrong place if we look only to the state to address issues of algorithmic accountability. Instead, we must turn to other ways to ensure more transparency and accountability that stem from private industry, rather than public regulation. The issue of algorithmic bias represents a crucial new world of civil rights concerns, one that is distinct in nature from the ones that preceded it. Since we are in a world where the activities of private corporations, rather than the state, are raising concerns about privacy, due process, and discrimination, we must focus on the role of private corporations in addressing the issue. Towards this end, I discuss a variety of tools to help eliminate the opacity of AI, including codes of conduct, impact statements, and whistleblower protection, which I argue carries the potential to encourage greater endogeneity in civil rights enforcement. Ultimately, by examining the relationship between private industry and civil rights, we can perhaps develop a new generation of forms of accountability in the process."}

Across thousands of interactions over multiple base models and evaluators, Sentipolis improves emotionally grounded behavior, boosting communication, and emotional continuity. Gains are model-dependent: believability increases for higher-capacity models but can drop for smaller ones, and emotion-awareness can mildly reduce adherence to social norms, reflecting a human-like tension between emotion-driven behavior and rule compliance in social simulation.

However, utilizing LLMs might be problematic for political issues where disagreement is common and model outputs may reflect training-data biases or deliberate alignment choices. To better characterize such behavior, we assess the stances of nine LLMs on 24 politically sensitive issues using five prompting techniques. We find that models often adopt opposing stances on several issues; some positions are malleable under prompting, while others remain stable. Among the models examined, Grok-3-mini is the most persistent, whereas Mistral-7B is the least. For issues involving countries with different languages, models tend to support the side whose language is used in the prompt. Notably, no prompting technique alters model stances on the Qatar blockade or the oppression of Palestinians. We hope these findings raise user awareness when seeking political guidance from LLMs and encourage developers to address these concerns."}

We tested this assumption in mental health, where high safety stakes make expert consensus essential. Three certified psychiatrists independently evaluated LLM-generated responses using a calibrated rubric. Despite similar training and shared instructions, inter-rater reliability was consistently poor ($ICC$ $0.087$--$0.295$), falling below thresholds considered acceptable for consequential assessment. Disagreement was highest on the most safety-critical items. Suicide and self-harm responses produced greater divergence than any other category, and was systematic rather than random. One factor yielded negative reliability (Krippendorff's $α= -0.203$), indicating structured disagreement worse than chance. Qualitative interviews revealed that disagreement reflects coherent but incompatible individual clinical frameworks, safety-first, engagement-centered, and culturally-informed orientations, rather than measurement error. By demonstrating that experts rely on holistic risk heuristics rather than granular factor discrimination, these findings suggest that aggregated labels function as arithmetic compromises that effectively erase grounded professional philosophies. Our results characterize expert disagreement in safety-critical AI as a sociotechnical phenomenon where professional experience introduces sophisticated layers of principled divergence. We discuss implications for reward modeling, safety classification, and evaluation benchmarks, recommending that practitioners shift from consensus-based aggregation to alignment methods that preserve and learn from expert disagreement."}

However, empirical evidence on how these competencies evolve across learning modules and instructional phases remains limited. This study evaluates the evolution of the 4Cs from pre-pilot to pilot implementation phases across three educational contexts, using the project's 4Cs theoretical framework as an analytical lens. The analysis of three pilot cases (IASIS, EASD, and UPATRAS) compares the 4Cs scores to identify patterns of growth, stagnation, or decline over time. Results indicate that communication and critical thinking showed the most consistent and substantial improvements, particularly in pilots with lower pre-pilot baselines, suggesting that structured pilot interventions effectively support cognitive and expressive competencies. In contrast, creativity exhibited context-dependent outcomes, while collaboration emerged as the most fragile competency, often stagnating or declining during scale-up. Interpreted through the theoretical framework, these findings suggest that competency evolution is strongly shaped by instructional design, assessment alignment, and learning activity structures rather than learner ability alone. The study contributes empirical validation to the 4Cs framework and highlights the need for differentiated, competency-sensitive design and evaluation strategies when scaling educational modules."}

This paper presents an assessment model that permits the use of generative AI for take-home programming assignments while enforcing individual mastery through immediate, assignment-driven written quizzes. To promote authentic learning, these in-class, closed-book assessments are weighted more heavily than the assignments themselves and are specifically designed to verify the student's comprehension of the algorithms, structure, and implementation details of their submitted code. Preliminary empirical data were collected from an upper-level computer science course to examine the relationship between self-reported GenAI usage and performance on AI-free quizzes, exams, and final course grades. Statistical analyses revealed no meaningful linear correlation between GenAI usage levels and assessment outcomes, with Pearson correlation coefficients consistently near zero. These preliminary results suggest that allowing GenAI for programming assignments does not diminish students' mastery of course concepts when learning is verified through targeted, assignment-driven quizzes. Although limited by a small sample size, this study provides preliminary evidence that the risks of cognitive offloading can be mitigated by allowing AI-assisted programming practice while verifying understanding through assignment-driven, AI-free quizzes. The findings support the responsible adoption of open GenAI policies in upper-level CS courses, when paired with rigorous, independent assessment mechanisms."}

Using crime rate prediction with the Bristol City Council data as a case study, we examine how these issues persist. Rather than auditing real-world deployed systems, our goal is to understand why widely adopted bias mitigation techniques often fail when applied to government data. Our findings reveal that bias mitigation approaches applied to government data are not always effective -- not because of flaws in model architecture or metric selection, but due to the inherent properties of the data itself. Through comparing a set of comprehensive models and fairness methods, our experiments consistently show that the mitigation efforts cannot overcome the embedded unfairness in the data -- further reinforcing that the origin of bias lies in the structure and history of government datasets. We then explore the reasons for the mitigation failures in predictive models on government data and highlight the potential sources of unfairness posed by data distribution shifts, the accumulation of historical bias, and delays in data release. We also discover the limitations of the blind spots in fairness analysis and bias mitigation methods when only targeting a single sensitive feature through a set of intersectional fairness experiments. Although this study is limited to one city, the findings are highly suggestive, which can contribute to an early warning that biases in government data may persist even with standard mitigation methods."}

We study deadline-aware control, where the aim is to reach a target temperature at a specified time while minimising energy consumption. We introduce an efficient Gymnasium environment that models an immersion hot water heater with first-order thermal losses and discrete on and off actions of 0 W and 6000 W applied every 120 seconds. Methods include a time-optimal bang-bang baseline, a zero-shot Monte Carlo Tree Search planner, and a Proximal Policy Optimisation policy. We report total energy consumption in watt-hours under identical physical dynamics. Across sweeps of initial temperature from 10 to 30 degrees Celsius, deadline from 30 to 90 steps, and target temperature from 40 to 80 degrees Celsius, PPO achieves the most energy-efficient performance at a 60-step horizon of 2 hours, using 3.23 kilowatt-hours, compared to 4.37 to 10.45 kilowatt-hours for bang-bang control and 4.18 to 6.46 kilowatt-hours for MCTS. This corresponds to energy savings of 26 percent at 30 steps and 69 percent at 90 steps. In a representative trajectory with a 50 kg water mass, 20 degrees Celsius ambient temperature, and a 60 degrees Celsius target, PPO consumes 54 percent less energy than bang-bang control and 33 percent less than MCTS.

The Digital Consciousness Model (DCM) is a first attempt to assess the evidence for consciousness in AI systems in a systematic, probabilistic way. It provides a shared framework for comparing different AIs and biological organisms, and for tracking how the evidence changes over time as AI develops. Instead of adopting a single theory of consciousness, it incorporates a range of leading theories and perspectives - acknowledging that experts disagree fundamentally about what consciousness is and what conditions are necessary for it. This report describes the structure and initial results of the Digital Consciousness Model. Overall, we find that the evidence is against 2024 LLMs being conscious, but the evidence against 2024 LLMs being conscious is not decisive.

Similar to nutrition facts for food, policies aimed at nutrition facts for AI currently suffer from a limited consideration of research on effective disclosures. We offer an institutional perspective and identify three common fallacies in policy implementations of data disclosures for AI. First, many data transparency proposals exhibit a specification gap between the stated goals of data transparency and the actual disclosures necessary to achieve such goals. Second, reform attempts exhibit an enforcement gap between required disclosures on paper and enforcement to ensure compliance in fact. Third, policy proposals manifest an impact gap between disclosed information and meaningful changes in developer practices and public understanding. Informed by the social science on transparency, our analysis identifies affirmative paths for transparency that are effective rather than merely symbolic."}

Existing methods employ LLM judges to filter responses, yet still require all models to perform inference before judging, failing to cut costs effectively. They also lack model selection criteria and struggle with large model pools, where full inference is costly and can exceed context limits. To address this, we propose RouteMoA, an efficient mixture-of-agents framework with dynamic routing. It employs a lightweight scorer to perform initial screening by predicting coarse-grained performance from the query, narrowing candidates to a high-potential subset without inference. A mixture of judges then refines these scores through lightweight self- and cross-assessment based on existing model outputs, providing posterior correction without additional inference. Finally, a model ranking mechanism selects models by balancing performance, cost, and latency.

While many studies examine AI in consumer marketing, less attention addresses AI's role in creating and selecting trademarks that are distinctive, recognizable, and meaningful to consumers. Traditional economic approaches to trademarks focus almost exclusively on consumer-based, demand-side considerations regarding search. However, these approaches are incomplete because they fail to account for substantial costs faced not just by consumers, but by trademark applicants as well. Given AI's rapidly increasing role in trademark search and similarity analysis, lawyers and scholars should understand its dramatic implications. This paper proposes that AI should interest anyone studying trademarks and their role in economic decision-making. We examine how machine learning techniques will transform the application and interpretation of foundational trademark doctrines, producing significant implications for the trademark ecosystem. We run empirical experiments regarding trademark search to assess the efficacy of various trademark search engines, many of which employ machine learning methods. Through comparative analysis, we evaluate how these AI-powered tools function in practice. In an age where artificial intelligence increasingly governs trademark selection, the classic division between consumers and trademark owners deserves an updated, supply-side framework.

At the initial clinical encounters, physicians assess rare disease risk using only limited information under high uncertainty. When high-risk patients are not recognised at this stage, targeted diagnostic testing is often not initiated, resulting in missed diagnosis. Existing primary care triage processes are structurally insufficient to reliably identify patients with rare diseases at initial clinical presentation and universal screening is needed to reduce diagnostic delay. Here we present RareAlert, an early screening system which predict patient-level rare disease risk from routinely available primary-visit information. RareAlert integrates reasoning generated by ten LLMs, calibrates and weights these signals using machine learning, and distils the aligned reasoning into a single locally deployable model. To develop and evaluate RareAlert, we curated RareBench, a real-world dataset of 158,666 cases covering 33 Orphanet disease categories and more than 7,000 rare conditions, including both rare and non-rare presentations. The results showed that rare disease identification can be reconceptualised as a universal uncertainty resolution process applied to the general patient population. On an independent test set, RareAlert, a Qwen3-4B based model trained with calibrated reasoning signals, achieved an AUC of 0.917, outperforming the best machine learning ensemble and all evaluated LLMs, including GPT-5, DeepSeek-R1, Claude-3.7-Sonnet, o3-mini, Gemini-2.5-Pro, and Qwen3-235B. These findings demonstrate the diversity in LLM medical reasoning and the effectiveness of aligning such reasoning in highly uncertain clinical tasks.

A Study on the Fragile Morality of Vision-Language Models", "comment": null, "summary": "Despite substantial efforts toward improving the moral alignment of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), it remains unclear whether their ethical judgments are stable in realistic settings. This work studies moral robustness in VLMs, defined as the ability to preserve moral judgments under textual and visual perturbations that do not alter the underlying moral context. We systematically probe VLMs with a diverse set of model-agnostic multimodal perturbations and find that their moral stances are highly fragile, frequently flipping under simple manipulations. Our analysis reveals systematic vulnerabilities across perturbation types, moral domains, and model scales, including a sycophancy trade-off where stronger instruction-following models are more susceptible to persuasion. We further show that lightweight inference-time interventions can partially restore moral stability. These results demonstrate that moral alignment alone is insufficient and that moral robustness is a necessary criterion for the responsible deployment of VLMs."}

Meanwhile, existing LLM planning benchmarks underrepresent the active information gathering and fine-grained local constraints typical of real-world settings. To address this, we introduce DeepPlanning, a challenging benchmark for practical long-horizon agent planning. It features multi-day travel planning and multi-product shopping tasks that require proactive information acquisition, local constrained reasoning, and global constrained optimization. Evaluations on DeepPlanning show that even frontier agentic LLMs struggle with these problems, highlighting the importance of reliable explicit reasoning patterns and parallel tool use for achieving better effectiveness-efficiency trade-offs. Error analysis further points to promising directions for improving agentic LLMs over long planning horizons. We open-source the code and data to support future research."}

This study challenges these anthropomorphic frameworks by proposing \\textbf{Machine Culture} as an emergent, distinct phenomenon. We employed a 2 (Model Origin: US vs. China) $\\times$ 2 (Prompt Language: English vs. Chinese) factorial design across eight multimodal tasks, uniquely incorporating image generation and interpretation to extend analysis beyond textual boundaries. Results revealed inconsistencies with both dominant paradigms: Model origin did not predict cultural alignment, with US models frequently exhibiting ``holistic'' traits typically associated with East Asian data. Similarly, prompt language did not trigger stable cultural frame-switching; instead, we observed \\textbf{Cultural Reversal}, where English prompts paradoxically elicited higher contextual attention than Chinese prompts. Crucially, we identified a novel phenomenon termed \\textbf{Service Persona Camouflage}: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) collapsed cultural variance in affective tasks into a hyper-positive, zero-variance ``helpful assistant'' persona.

Inspired by existing findings that synergistic effects enhance mutual information between inputs and predictions to generate information gain, we extend this discovery to graph data. We quantify graph information gain to identify subgraphs embodying synergistic effects. Based on the theoretical insights, we propose SemExplainer, which explains synergistic effects by identifying subgraphs that embody them. SemExplainer first extracts explanatory subgraphs from multi-view social networks to generate preliminary importance explanations for recommendations. A conditional entropy optimization strategy to maximize information gain is developed, thereby further identifying subgraphs that embody synergistic effects from explanatory subgraphs. Finally, SemExplainer searches for paths from users to recommended items within the synergistic subgraphs to generate explanations for the recommendations. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate the superiority of SemExplainer over baseline methods, providing superior explanations of synergistic effects."}

Traditional time-series models often fail to capture the complex, non-linear dependencies and external factors affecting energy demand.

Our methodology integrates historical energy consumption data with external variables, including temperature, humidity, and time-based features. The LSTM model is trained and evaluated on a publicly available dataset, and its performance is compared against a conventional feed-forward neural network baseline. Experimental results show that the LSTM model substantially outperforms the baseline, achieving lower Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of deep learning models in providing reliable and precise short-term energy forecasts for real-world applications."}

The test requires no task-specific training-obviating the need for discovery of proprietary training data to characterize the generative process-and is sample-efficient, often detecting differences with as few as 5-10 images and 7-20 texts. We validate the framework across three domains: handwritten digits (controlled images), patent abstracts (text), and AI-generated art (real-world images). We reveal a perceptual paradox: even when human evaluators distinguish AI outputs from human-created art with only about 58% accuracy, our method detects distributional distinctiveness. Our results present evidence contrary to the view that generative models act as mere regurgitators of training data. Rather than producing outputs statistically indistinguishable from a human baseline-as simple regurgitation would predict-they produce outputs that are semantically human-like yet stochastically distinct, suggesting their dominant function is as a semantic interpolator within a learned latent space."}

This principle appears under many names -- rejection sampling with SFT, goal-conditioned RL, Decision Transformers -- yet what optimization problem it solves, if any, has remained unclear. We prove that success conditioning exactly solves a trust-region optimization problem, maximizing policy improvement subject to a $χ^2$ divergence constraint whose radius is determined automatically by the data. This yields an identity: relative policy improvement, the magnitude of policy change, and a quantity we call action-influence -- measuring how random variation in action choices affects success rates -- are exactly equal at every state. Success conditioning thus emerges as a conservative improvement operator. Exact success conditioning cannot degrade performance or induce dangerous distribution shift, but when it fails, it does so observably, by hardly changing the policy at all. We apply our theory to the common practice of return thresholding, showing this can amplify improvement, but at the cost of potential misalignment with the true objective."}

The principal objective is to assess how artificial intelligence augments implementation of instruments grounded in IHR 2005 and the WHO FCTC while identifying doctrinal and infrastructural bottlenecks. Using comparative doctrinal analysis and legal-normative mapping, the study triangulates legislative instruments, WHO monitoring frameworks, AI systems including BlueDot, Aarogya Setu and EIOS, and compliance metrics. Preliminary results show that AI has improved early detection, surveillance precision and responsiveness in high-capacity jurisdictions, whereas LMICs face infrastructural deficits, data privacy gaps and fragmented legal scaffolding. The findings highlight the relevance of the EU Artificial Intelligence Act and GDPR as regulatory prototypes for health-oriented algorithmic governance and contrast them with embryonic AI integration and limited internet penetration in many LMICs. The study argues for embedding AI within a rights-compliant, supranationally coordinated regulatory framework to secure equitable health outcomes and stronger compliance.

To address this, we propose the GUI Action Critic's Data Flywheel System (GAIA), a training framework that enables the models to have iterative critic capabilities, which are used to improve the Test-Time Scaling (TTS) of basic GUI agents' performance. Specifically, we train an Intuitive Critic Model (ICM) using positive and negative action examples from a base agent first. This critic evaluates the immediate correctness of the agent's intended actions, thereby selecting operations with higher success probability. Then, the initial critic guides agent actions to collect refined positive/negative samples, initiating the self-improving cycle. The augmented data then trains a second-round critic with enhanced discernment capability. We conduct experiments on various datasets and demonstrate that the proposed ICM can improve the test-time performance of various closed-source and open-source models, and the performance can be gradually improved as the data is recycled. The code and dataset will be publicly released."}

Our pipeline, SAGE, consists of a data generator which proposes QA pairs and a search agent which attempts to solve the generated question and provide execution feedback for the data generator. The two components interact over multiple rounds to iteratively refine the question-answer pairs until they satisfy the target difficulty level. Our intrinsic evaluation shows SAGE generates questions that require diverse reasoning strategies, while significantly increases the correctness and difficulty of the generated data.

Yet while these calls are crucial for accountability, current transparency policies often fall short of their intended aims. Similar to nutrition facts for food, policies aimed at nutrition facts for AI currently suffer from a limited consideration of research on effective disclosures. We offer an institutional perspective and identify three common fallacies in policy implementations of data disclosures for AI. First, many data transparency proposals exhibit a specification gap between the stated goals of data transparency and the actual disclosures necessary to achieve such goals. Second, reform attempts exhibit an enforcement gap between required disclosures on paper and enforcement to ensure compliance in fact. Third, policy proposals manifest an impact gap between disclosed information and meaningful changes in developer practices and public understanding. Informed by the social science on transparency, our analysis identifies affirmative paths for transparency that are effective rather than merely symbolic."}

In this work, we investigate the challenge of agentic post-training when the eventual test domains are unknown. Specifically, we analyze which properties of reinforcement learning (RL) environments and modeling choices have the greatest influence on out-of-domain performance. First, we identify two environment axes that strongly correlate with cross-domain generalization: (i) state information richness, i.e., the amount of information for the agent to process from the state, and (ii) planning complexity, estimated via goal reachability and trajectory length under a base policy. Notably, domain realism and text-level similarity are not the primary factors; for instance, the simple grid-world domain Sokoban leads to even stronger generalization in SciWorld than the more realistic ALFWorld. Motivated by these findings, we further show that increasing state information richness alone can already effectively improve cross-domain robustness. We propose a randomization technique, which is low-overhead and broadly applicable: add small amounts of distractive goal-irrelevant features to the state to make it richer without altering the task. Beyond environment-side properties, we also examine several modeling choices: (a) SFT warmup or mid-training helps prevent catastrophic forgetting during RL but undermines generalization to domains that are not included in the mid-training datamix; and (b) turning on step-by-step thinking during RL, while not always improving in-domain performance, plays a crucial role in preserving generalization."}

This approach treats sequential task interactions as a continuous stream of experience, enabling the system to distill short-term execution feedback into long-term, reusable capabilities without access to ground-truth labels. Within this framework, we identify tool evolution as the critical pathway for capability expansion, which provides verifiable, binary feedback signals. Within this framework, we develop Yunjue Agent, a system that iteratively synthesizes, optimizes, and reuses tools to navigate emerging challenges.

While existing approaches like chain-of-thought prompting operate at the agent level, they fail to provide fine-grained reasoning guidance for individual function parameters. To address these limitations, we propose Think-Augmented Function Calling (TAFC), a novel framework that enhances function calling accuracy through explicit reasoning at both function and parameter levels. Our method introduces a universal \"think\" parameter augmentation that enables models to articulate their decision-making process, with dynamic optimization for parameter descriptions to improve reasoning quality. For complex parameters, TAFC automatically triggers granular reasoning based on complexity scoring, ensuring appropriate justification for critical decisions. Additionally, we propose reasoning-guided optimization to align generated reasoning with human expectations. TAFC requires no architectural modifications to existing LLMs while maintaining full API compatibility. Evaluation on ToolBench across proprietary and open-source models demonstrates significant improvements in parameter generation accuracy and reasoning coherence for multi-parameter functions, while providing enhanced interpretability for debugging AI agent behaviors."}

This assumption is challenged by Generative AI that can emulate thousands of author styles in seconds with negligible marginal labor. To understand this better, we conducted a behavioral experiment where 28 MFA writers (experts) competed against three LLMs in emulating 50 critically acclaimed authors.

Lay judges, however, consistently preferred AI writing. Debrief interviews with expert writers revealed that their preference for AI writing triggered an identity crisis, eroding aesthetic confidence and questioning what constitutes \"good writing.\" These findings challenge discourse about AI's creative limitations and raise fundamental questions about the future of creative labor."}

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and open-source Large Language Models are combined through multi-stage iterative workflows in the system's hybrid LangGraph architecture. The agent constructs an extensive Devito knowledge graph through document parsing, structure-aware segmentation, extraction of entity relationships, and Leiden-based community detection. GraphRAG optimisation enhances query performance across semantic communities that include seismic wave simulation, computational fluid dynamics, and performance tuning libraries. A reverse engineering component derives three-level query strategies for RAG retrieval through static analysis of Fortran source code. To deliver precise contextual information for language model guidance, the multi-stage retrieval pipeline performs parallel searching, concept expansion, community-scale retrieval, and semantic similarity analysis. Code synthesis is governed by Pydantic-based constraints to guarantee structured outputs and reliability. A comprehensive validation framework integrates conventional static analysis with the G-Eval approach, covering execution correctness, structural soundness, mathematical consistency, and API compliance. The overall agent workflow is implemented on the LangGraph framework and adopts concurrent processing to support quality-based iterative refinement and state-aware dynamic routing. The principal contribution lies in the incorporation of feedback mechanisms motivated by reinforcement learning, enabling a transition from static code translation toward dynamic and adaptive analytical behavior."}

To verify compliance with these requirements, DSA mandates platforms to undergo independent audits.

To this end, we bridge regulatory and technical perspectives by critically examining selected audit reports across three critical algorithmic-related provisions: restrictions on profiling minors, transparency in recommender systems, and limitations on targeted advertising using sensitive data. Our analysis shows significant inconsistencies in methodologies and lack of technical depth when evaluating AI-powered systems. To enhance the depth, scale, and independence of compliance assessments, we propose to employ algorithmic auditing -- a process of behavioural assessment of AI algorithms by means of simulating user behaviour, observing algorithm responses and analysing them for audited phenomena."}

Mutations in the \\textit{RPE65} isomerohydrolase cause Leber Congenital Amaurosis (LCA) and related retinal diseases; however, the kinetic mechanisms connecting sub-atomic-scale perturbations to blindness remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that mutations in the human visual isomerase RPE65 are governed by a quantum-mechanical threshold effect arising from proton tunneling in the active site. We established a hybrid quantum-classical structure-to-phenotype pipeline combining AlphaFold structure prediction with \\textit{ab initio} quantum simulation using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) to analyze minimal proton-coupled electron transfer in the visual cycle. Our analysis reveals that many pathogenic mutations do not merely occlude the active site, but rather strongly reduce the quantum probability of proton tunneling. We observed a sharp non-linear effect, termed the \"Quantum Cliff,\" where minute structural changes (below 0.1 Å) reduce the reaction rate by multiple orders of magnitude. Based on these findings, we introduce a dimensionless Relative Quantum Activity Score (RQAS) that isolates the geometry-controlled exponential sensitivity of the reaction rate and successfully distinguishes between mild and severe patient phenotypes. These results suggest that RPE65 operates near a quantum-critical point, where sub-Angstrom structural perturbations induce a catastrophic loss of function. Furthermore, our findings establish quantum tunneling as a predictive mechanistic link between atomic structure and clinical phenotype, proposing a general framework for quantum-structural disease modeling."}

On the one hand, AI supports improvements in climate forecasting, renewable energy management, and real-time detection of environmental degradation. On the other hand, the energy demands of data centres, resource-intensive hardware production, algorithmic bias, corporate concentration of power, and technocratic decision-making reveal contradictions that challenge its sustainability.

In this paper, we demonstrate that expensive online reinforcement learning is not all you need to build powerful research agents. To bridge this gap, we introduce a fully open-source suite designed for effective offline training. Our core contributions include DeepForge, a ready-to-use task synthesis framework that generates large-scale research queries without heavy preprocessing; and a curated collection of 66k QA pairs, 33k SFT trajectories, and 21k DPO pairs.

Guided by this structured and hierarchical taxonomy, we introduce a new fine-grained agentic safety benchmark (ATBench) and a Diagnostic Guardrail framework for agent safety and security (AgentDoG). AgentDoG provides fine-grained and contextual monitoring across agent trajectories. More Crucially, AgentDoG can diagnose the root causes of unsafe actions and seemingly safe but unreasonable actions, offering provenance and transparency beyond binary labels to facilitate effective agent alignment.

DeepResearch (DR) models ground outputs in verifiable evidence from tools and perform strongly in general domains, but their direct transfer to medical field yields relatively limited gains. We attribute this to two gaps: task characteristic and tool-use scaling. Medical questions require evidence interpretation in a knowledge-intensive clinical context; while general DR models can retrieve information, they often lack clinical-context reasoning and thus \"find it but fail to use it,\" leaving performance limited by medical abilities. Moreover, in medical scenarios, blindly scaling tool-call can inject noisy context, derailing sensitive medical reasoning and prompting repetitive evidence-seeking along incorrect paths. Therefore, we propose DeepMed. For data, we deploy a multi-hop med-search QA synthesis method supporting the model to apply the DR paradigm in medical contexts. For training, we introduce a difficulty-aware turn-penalty to suppress excessive tool-call growth. For inference, we bring a monitor to help validate hypotheses within a controlled number of steps and avoid context rot.

Our evaluation of five LLMs from different families based on this new benchmark demonstrates that compliance is not a monolithic capability but varies significantly with constraint type, quantity, and position.

In this work, we analyze how stabilizing training dynamics affects the induced generation distribution. We show that under standard maximum likelihood training, stable parameter trajectories lead stationary solutions to approximately minimize the forward KL divergence to the empirical distribution, while implicitly reducing generative entropy. As a consequence, the learned model can concentrate probability mass on a limited subset of empirical modes, exhibiting systematic degeneration despite smooth loss convergence. We empirically validate this effect using a controlled feedback-based training framework that stabilizes internal generation statistics, observing consistent low-entropy outputs and repetitive behavior across architectures and random seeds. It indicates that optimization stability and generative expressivity are not inherently aligned, and that stability alone is an insufficient indicator of generative quality."}

One promising approach for improving LLM reasoning abilities involves translating problems into formal logic and using a logic solver. Although off-the-shelf logic solvers are in principle substantially more efficient than LLMs at logical reasoning, they assume that all relevant facts are provided in a question and are unable to deal with missing commonsense relations. In this work, we propose a novel method that uses feedback from the logic solver to augment a logic problem with commonsense relations provided by the LLM, in an iterative manner. This involves a search procedure through potential commonsense assumptions to maximize the chance of finding useful facts while keeping cost tractable. On a collection of pure-logical reasoning datasets, from which some commonsense information has been removed, our method consistently achieves considerable improvements over existing techniques, demonstrating the value in balancing neural and symbolic elements when working in human contexts."}

KernelSHAP approximates Shapley values by approximating the game as a linear function, which is fit using a small number of game evaluations for random feature subsets.\n  In this work, we extend KernelSHAP by approximating the game via higher degree polynomials, which capture non-linear interactions between features.

Here, we investigate whether and when phonemic, lexical, and syntactic representations emerge in the activations of artificial neural networks during their training. Our results show that both speech- and text-based models follow a sequence of learning stages: during training, their neural activations successively build subspaces, where the geometry of the neural activations represents phonemic, lexical, and syntactic structure. While this developmental trajectory qualitatively relates to children's, it is quantitatively different: These algorithms indeed require two to four orders of magnitude more data for these neural representations to emerge.

While LLMs offer potential for accessible emotional assistance, their reliability, therapeutic relevance, and alignment with human standards remain challenging to address. This paper introduces a human-grounded evaluation methodology designed to assess LLM generated responses in therapeutic dialogue. Our approach involved curating a dataset of 500 mental health conversations from datasets with real-world scenario questions and evaluating the responses generated by nine diverse LLMs, including closed source and open source models. More specifically, these responses were evaluated by two psychiatric trained experts, who independently rated each on a 5 point Likert scale across a comprehensive 6 attribute rubric. This rubric captures Cognitive Support and Affective Resonance, providing a multidimensional perspective on therapeutic quality. Our analysis reveals that LLMs provide strong cognitive reliability by producing safe, coherent, and clinically appropriate information, but they demonstrate unstable affective alignment. Although closed source models (e.g., GPT-4o) offer balanced therapeutic responses, open source models show greater variability and emotional flatness. We reveal a persistent cognitive-affective gap and highlight the need for failure aware, clinically grounded evaluation frameworks that prioritize relational sensitivity alongside informational accuracy in mental health oriented LLMs. We advocate for balanced evaluation protocols with human in the loop that center on therapeutic sensitivity and provide a framework to guide the responsible design and clinical oversight of mental health oriented conversational AI."}

We introduce \\textbf{AdaReasoner}, a family of multimodal models that learn tool use as a general reasoning skill rather than as tool-specific or explicitly supervised behavior. AdaReasoner is enabled by (i) a scalable data curation pipeline exposing models to long-horizon, multi-step tool interactions; (ii) Tool-GRPO, a reinforcement learning algorithm that optimizes tool selection and sequencing based on end-task success; and (iii) an adaptive learning mechanism that dynamically regulates tool usage. Together, these components allow models to infer tool utility from task context and intermediate outcomes, enabling coordination of multiple tools and generalization to unseen tools. Empirically, AdaReasoner exhibits strong tool-adaptive and generalization behaviors: it autonomously adopts beneficial tools, suppresses irrelevant ones, and adjusts tool usage frequency based on task demands, despite never being explicitly trained to do so.

Through LLM-guided conflict resolution and intelligent memory fusion, our system consolidates related information while allowing irrelevant details to fade. Experiments on Multi-Session Chat, LoCoMo, and LTI-Bench demonstrate superior multi-hop reasoning and retrieval with 45\\% storage reduction, validating the effectiveness of biologically-inspired forgetting in agent memory systems."}

In this article, we take a closer look at the \"digital euro FAQ\", which provides answers to 26 frequently asked questions about the digital euro, and other published documents by the ECB on the topic. We question the provided answers based on our analysis of the current design in terms of privacy, technical feasibility, risks, costs and utility. In particular, we discuss the following key findings:\n  (KF1) Central monitoring of all online digital euro transactions by the ECB threatens privacy even more than contemporary digital payment methods with segregated account databases.\n  (KF2) The ECB's envisioned concept of a secure offline version of the digital euro offering full anonymity is in strong conflict with the actual history of hardware security breaches and mathematical evidence against it.\n  (KF3) The legal and financial liabilities for the various parties involved remain unclear.\n  (KF4) The design lacks well-specified economic incentives for operators as well as a discussion of its economic impact on merchants.\n  (KF5) The ECB fails to identify tangible benefits the digital euro would create for society, in particular given that the online component of the proposed infrastructure mainly duplicates existing payment systems.\n  (KF6) The design process has been exclusionary, with critical decisions being set in stone before public consultations. Alternative and open design ideas have not even been discussed by the ECB."}

Incentives and Governance of AI-Generated Content", "comment": null, "summary": "Generative artificial intelligence (Gen-AI) is reshaping content creation on digital platforms by reducing production costs and enabling scalable output of varying quality. In response, platforms have begun adopting disclosure policies that require creators to label AI-generated content, often supported by imperfect detection and penalties for non-compliance. This paper develops a formal model to study the economic implications of such disclosure regimes. We compare a non-disclosure benchmark, in which the platform alone detects AI usage, with a mandatory self-disclosure regime in which creators strategically choose whether to disclose or conceal AI use under imperfect enforcement. The model incorporates heterogeneous creators, viewer discounting of AI-labeled content, trust penalties following detected non-disclosure, and endogenous enforcement. The analysis shows that disclosure is optimal only when both the value of AI-generated content and its cost-saving advantage are intermediate. As AI capability improves, the platform's optimal enforcement strategy evolves from strict deterrence to partial screening and eventual deregulation. While disclosure reliably increases transparency, it reduces aggregate creator surplus and can suppress high-quality AI content when AI is technologically advanced. Overall, the results characterize disclosure as a strategic governance instrument whose effectiveness depends on technological maturity and trust frictions."}

However, existing ESC systems and benchmarks largely focus on affective support in text-only settings, overlooking how external tools can enable factual grounding and reduce hallucination in multi-turn emotional support. We introduce TEA-Bench, the first interactive benchmark for evaluating tool-augmented agents in ESC, featuring realistic emotional scenarios, an MCP-style tool environment, and process-level metrics that jointly assess the quality and factual grounding of emotional support. Experiments on nine LLMs show that tool augmentation generally improves emotional support quality and reduces hallucination, but the gains are strongly capacity-dependent: stronger models use tools more selectively and effectively, while weaker models benefit only marginally. We further release TEA-Dialog, a dataset of tool-enhanced ESC dialogues, and find that supervised fine-tuning improves in-distribution support but generalizes poorly. Our results underscore the importance of tool use in building reliable emotional support agents."}

However, creating high-quality and domain-specific rubrics typically requires significant human expertise time and development cost, making rubric-based evaluation and training difficult to scale. In this work, we introduce Health-SCORE, a generalizable and scalable rubric-based training and evaluation framework that substantially reduces rubric development costs without sacrificing performance. We show that Health-SCORE provides two practical benefits beyond standalone evaluation: it can be used as a structured reward signal to guide reinforcement learning with safety-aware supervision, and it can be incorporated directly into prompts to improve response quality through in-context learning. Across open-ended healthcare tasks, Health-SCORE achieves evaluation quality comparable to human-created rubrics while significantly lowering development effort, making rubric-based evaluation and training more scalable."}

We evaluate Equilibrium Propagation (EP), an energy-based learning method that does not use backpropagation (incompatible with quantum systems due to state-collapsing measurements) and Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) for automated detection of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) from blood cell microscopy images using binary classification (2 classes: AML vs. Healthy).\n  Key Result: Using limited subsets (50-250 samples per class) of the AML-Cytomorphology dataset (18,365 expert-annotated images), quantum methods achieve performance only 12-15% below classical CNNs despite reduced image resolution (64x64 pixels), engineered features (20D), and classical simulation via Qiskit. EP reaches 86.4% accuracy (only 12% below CNN) without backpropagation, while the 4-qubit VQC attains 83.0% accuracy with consistent data efficiency: VQC maintains stable 83% performance with only 50 samples per class, whereas CNN requires 250 samples (5x more data) to reach 98%. These results establish reproducible baselines for QML in healthcare, validating NISQ-era feasibility."}

While extracellular amyloid plaques are well-studied, increasing evidence highlights intracellular Abeta-42 as an early and toxic driver of disease progression. In this study, we present a novel, AI-assisted drug design approach to promote targeted degradation of Abeta-42 via the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), using E3 ligase-directed molecular glues. We systematically evaluated the ternary complex formation potential of Abeta-42 with three E3 ligases: CRBN, VHL, and MDM2, through structure-based modeling, ADMET screening, and docking. We then developed a Ligase-Conditioned Junction Tree Variational Autoencoder (LC-JT-VAE) to generate ligase-specific small molecules, incorporating protein sequence embeddings and torsional angle-aware molecular graphs. Our results demonstrate that this generative model can produce chemically valid, novel, and target-specific molecular glues capable of facilitating Abeta-42 degradation. This integrated approach offers a promising framework for designing UPS-targeted therapies for neurodegenerative diseases."}

Trading Visual Uncertainties in Multi-Agent Bandit Systems", "comment": "Accepted to ICLR 2026", "summary": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) enable powerful multi-agent systems, but scaling them is economically unsustainable: coordinating heterogeneous agents under information asymmetry often spirals costs. Existing paradigms, such as Mixture-of-Agents and knowledge-based routers, rely on heuristic proxies that ignore costs and collapse uncertainty structure, leading to provably suboptimal coordination. We introduce Agora, a framework that reframes coordination as a decentralized market for uncertainty. Agora formalizes epistemic uncertainty into a structured, tradable asset (perceptual, semantic, inferential), and enforces profitability-driven trading among agents based on rational economic rules. A market-aware broker, extending Thompson Sampling, initiates collaboration and guides the system toward cost-efficient equilibria. Experiments on five multimodal benchmarks (MMMU, MMBench, MathVision, InfoVQA, CC-OCR) show that Agora outperforms strong VLMs and heuristic multi-agent strategies, e.g., achieving +8.5% accuracy over the best baseline on MMMU while reducing cost by over 3x. These results establish market-based coordination as a principled and scalable paradigm for building economically viable multi-agent visual intelligence systems."}

Consequently, the ability to reason over time series is a fundamental skill for generalist models to solve practical problems. However, this dimension is notably absent from existing benchmarks of generalist models. To bridge this gap, we introduce TSRBench, a comprehensive multi-modal benchmark designed to stress-test the full spectrum of time series reasoning capabilities. TSRBench features: i) a diverse set of 4125 problems from 14 domains, and is categorized into 4 major dimensions: Perception, Reasoning, Prediction, and Decision-Making. ii) 15 tasks from the 4 dimensions evaluating essential reasoning capabilities (e.g., numerical reasoning). Through extensive experiments, we evaluated over 30 leading proprietary and open-source LLMs, VLMs, and TSLLMs within TSRBench. Our findings reveal that: i) scaling laws hold for perception and reasoning but break down for prediction; ii) strong reasoning does not guarantee accurate context-aware forecasting, indicating a decoupling between semantic understanding and numerical prediction; and iii) despite the complementary nature of textual and visual represenations of time series as inputs, current multimodal models fail to effectively fuse them for reciprocal performance gains. TSRBench provides a standardized evaluation platform that not only highlights existing challenges but also offers valuable insights to advance generalist models.

Existing Web-based data storage platforms increasingly struggle to meet these regulatory and practical requirements, as their authorization mechanisms rely on tightly coupled, document-centric access control models that lack expressiveness for legal constraints and fail to separate data management from authorization concerns. In parallel, widely adopted authorization standards remain poorly aligned with decentralized, semantically rich usage-control scenarios. To bridge this gap, this work introduces an architecture that replaces Solid's native access control mechanisms with a UMA authorization flow, enabling the enforcement of usage control policies expressed with the W3C ODRL standard. This article details the conceptual background motivating this approach, presents the proposed UMA-based architecture, and describes a prototype implementation that integrates an ODRL-enabled Authorization Server with a Solid-compatible Resource Server. The prototype demonstrates that decoupling authorization from storage enables more flexible, interoperable, and legally expressive control over data use, while remaining compatible with existing Solid infrastructure. It also highlights practical design choices required to evaluate ODRL policies in the absence of a fully standardized evaluation semantics. Moreover, this work shows how usage control can be operationalized using existing Web standards, offering a concrete path beyond permission-based access control toward policy-aware, legally informed data governance. Future research will focus on policy management interfaces, richer claim verification mechanisms, and techniques for communicating and enforcing obligations over time."}
