However, since the collapse of the Bretton\nWoods system, issuing more cheap currencies has become a common trend in the\ninternational community, and the legalization and over issuance of stablecoins\nwill strengthen this trend. In this context, our study focused on a parallel\nmonetary system based on a redeemable self-decay/devalued money(RSDM). Firstly,\nwe point out the idea of redeeming gold at a fixed denomination with gold\ncertificates is similar to an impossible perpetual motion machine. Only when\nthe face value of a gold token self-decays or self-depreciates and the weight\nof the reduced value can compensate for the storage cost of physical gold, can\nit be convertible or redeemable. Secondly, we pointed out that as a modern\n\"good money\" under the Internet environment, it must have two basic functions:\nlong-term value storage and zero logistics cost of money circulation. Thirdly,\nwe found that a single type of money is difficult to shoulder the\nresponsibility of modern \"good money\". Only a parallel monetary system,\nincluding RSDM, such as a triple-monetary system consisting of RSDM, domestic\nfiat and major international reserve currencies, can form the ultimate safe\nhaven of wealth and safeguard the reverse Gresham law. Based on this analysis,\nwe build an integer programming model for currency optimization selection in a\nmulti-monetary pool. Fourthly, several potential application scenarios of RSDM\nin the real world were discussed, including a new approach to activate dormant\ngold assets in India based on RSDM, and the gold monetization scheme in the\nUnited States.

However, the notion of a node's\nimportance is inherently context-dependent and must reflect both the system's\ndynamics and the specific objectives guiding its operation. Motivated by this\nperspective, we propose a dynamic, task-aware centrality framework rooted in\noptimal control theory. By formulating a problem on minimum energy control of\naverage opinion based on Laplacian dynamics and focusing on the variance of\nterminal state, we introduce a novel centrality measure--termed\nU-centrality--that quantifies a node's ability to unify the agents' state. We\ndemonstrate that U-centrality interpolates between known measures: it aligns\nwith degree centrality in the short-time horizon and converges to a new\ncentrality over longer time scales which is closely related to current-flow\ncloseness centrality. This work bridges structural and dynamical approaches to\ncentrality, offering a principled, versatile tool for network analysis in\ndynamic environments."}

The Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) hosts the\nworld's largest longitudinal dataset of climate-related survey responses,\ncombining structured indicators with open-ended narratives, but the\nheterogeneity and free-form nature of these disclosures present significant\nanalytical challenges for benchmarking, compliance monitoring, and investment\nscreening.

Fatalities are treated as two linked outcomes: the binary\noccurrence of deaths and the count of deaths when they occur. The model\ncombines additive fixed effects for covariates with random effects capturing\nspatiotemporal influences, allowing for outcome-specific effects. Covariates\ninclude event type and season as categorical variables, proximity to cities and\nborders as nonlinear effects, and population as an offset term in the count\nmodel. A latent spatiotemporal process accounts for shared spatial and temporal\ndependence, with the spatial structure modeled using a Mat\\'ern field prior and\ninference via Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA). Results show\nstrong spatial clustering and temporal variation in fatality risk, emphasizing\nthe importance of modeling both dimensions for better understanding and\nprediction. Airstrikes, shelling, and attacks show the highest fatality\nlikelihood and counts, while communal and rebel actors cause the most deaths.\nMultiple fatalities are more likely in summer, and proximity to borders drives\nintense violence, whereas remoteness from urban centers is linked to\nlower-intensity events. These results provide insight for planning, policy, and\nresource allocation to protect vulnerable communities."}

While increased entrepreneurial activity and national ambitions in\nspace have encouraged planners at public space agencies to develop markets\naround such systems, the very factors that make the recent growth of the space\neconomy so remarkable also challenge planners' efforts to develop and sustain\nmarkets for space-related goods and services. I propose a graphical framework\nto visualize the number of competitors a market can sustain as a function of\nthe industry's cost structure; the distribution of government support across\ndirect purchases, direct investments, and shared infrastructure; and the\nmagnitude of non-government demand. Building on public goods theory, the\nframework shows how marginal dollars invested in shared infrastructure can\ncreate non-rival benefits supporting more competitors per dollar than direct\npurchases or subsidies.

Findings from a Mixed-Methods Study on the Post-production Design Change Process of Navy Assets", "comment": null, "summary": "Complex engineered systems routinely face schedule and cost overruns, along\nwith poor post-deployment performance. Championed by both INCOSE and the U.S.\nDepartment of Defense (DoD), the systems engineering (SE) community has\nincreasingly looked to Digital Engineering (DE) as a potential remedy. Despite\nthis growing advocacy, most of DE's purported benefits remain anecdotal, and\nits return on investment (ROI) remains poorly understood. This research\npresents findings from a case study on a Navy SE team responsible for the\npreliminary design phase of post-production design change projects for Navy\nassets. Using a mixed-methods approach, we document why complex system\nsustainment projects are routinely late, where and to what extent schedule\nslips arise, and how a DE transformation could improve schedule adherence. This\nstudy makes three contributions. First, it identifies four archetypical\ninefficiency modes that drive schedule overruns and explains how these\nmechanisms unfold in their organizational context. Second, it quantifies the\nmagnitude and variation of schedule slips. Third, it creates a hypothetical\ndigitally transformed version of the current process, aligned with DoD DE\npolicy, and compares it to the current state to estimate potential schedule\ngains. Our findings suggest that a DE transformation could reduce the median\nproject duration by 50.1% and reduce the standard deviation by 41.5%, leading\nto faster and more predictable timelines. However, the observed gains are not\nuniform across task categories. Overall, this study provides initial\nquantitative evidence of DE's potential ROI and its value in improving the\nefficiency and predictability of complex system sustainment projects."}

To operationalize\nthese concepts, we leverage Large Language Models to develop semantic isolation\nmetrics that quantify a paper's location relative to the full-text literature.\nApplying this framework to a large corpus of economics articles, we uncover a\nfundamental trade-off: these two dimensions predict systematically different\noutcomes. Temporal novelty primarily predicts citation counts, whereas spatial\nnovelty predicts disruptive impact. This distinction allows us to construct a\ntypology of semantic neighborhoods, identifying four archetypes associated with\ndistinct and predictable impact profiles. Our findings demonstrate that novelty\ncan be understood as a multidimensional construct whose different forms,\nreflecting a paper's strategic location, have measurable and fundamentally\ndistinct consequences for scientific progress."}

Results reveal systematic heterogeneity by gender,\neducation, and normative environments. Conservative gender and parenthood norms\nare strong predictors of tolerance, while higher male education reduces it.\nTolerance of violence is also positively associated with reported leisure time\nwith partners and children, suggesting that co-presence does not necessarily\nreflect egalitarian interaction but may coexist with unequal bargaining\nstructures.

We answer this question affirmatively\nby proposing the Influence-aware Causal Autoencoder Network (ICAN), a novel\nframework that leverages causal representation learning to get robust,\ninvariant node embeddings for cross-network ranking tasks. Firstly, ICAN\nintroduces an influence-aware causal representation learning module within an\nautoencoder architecture to extract node embeddings that are causally related\nto node importance. Moreover, we introduce a causal ranking loss and design a\nunified optimization framework that jointly optimizes the reconstruction and\nranking objectives, enabling mutual reinforcement between node representation\nlearning and ranking optimization. This design allows ICAN, trained on\nsynthetic networks, to generalize effectively across diverse real-world graphs.\nExtensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that ICAN\nconsistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of both ranking\naccuracy and generalization capability."}

Individual Attitudes and Time Use Within the Household", "comment": null, "summary": "This paper proposes a novel empirical strategy to measure cultural\njustifications of domestic violence within households, with direct implications\nfor demographic behavior and gender inequality. Leveraging survey data on\nindividual attitudes and high-frequency time-use diaries from Italian couples\nwith children, I construct a composite index that integrates stated beliefs\nwith observed household practices. Using structural equation modeling, I\ndisentangle latent tolerance of domestic violence from reported attitudes and\nvalidate the index against both individual and partner characteristics, as well\nas time allocation patterns. Results reveal systematic heterogeneity by gender,\neducation, and normative environments. Conservative gender and parenthood norms\nare strong predictors of tolerance, while higher male education reduces it.\nTolerance of violence is also positively associated with reported leisure time\nwith partners and children, suggesting that co-presence does not necessarily\nreflect egalitarian interaction but may coexist with unequal bargaining\nstructures. Beyond advancing measurement, the findings highlight how cultural\ntolerance of domestic violence is embedded in household arrangements that\ninfluence fertility, labor supply, and the intergenerational transmission of\nnorms. The proposed framework offers a scalable tool for economists and\npolicymakers to monitor hidden inequalities and design interventions targeting\nfamily stability, gender equity, and child well-being."}

Although poverty alone predicted SNAP\nparticipation more accurately than the composite index, its explanatory power\nwas weaker than anticipated, echoing past findings that enrollment cannot be\nexplained by income alone. This led to a shift in focus: identifying ZIP codes\nwith high poverty but unexpectedly low SNAP participation, areas defined here\nas having a SNAP Gap, where ZIPs fall in the top 30 percent of family poverty\nand the bottom 10 percent of SNAP enrollment. Using nationally available ZIP\nlevel data from 2014 to 2023, I trained logistic classification models on four\ninterpretable structural indicators: lack of vehicle, lack of internet access,\nlack of computer access, and percentage of adults with only a high school\ndiploma. The most effective model relies on just two predictors, vehicle access\nand education, and outperforms tree based classifiers in both precision and\ncalibration.

We evaluate whether time-series foundation models can replace\nunrecorded trials from an early subset of reaches while preserving the\nreliability of standard Kinarm parameters.\n  Methods: We analyzed VGR speed signals from 461 stroke and 599 control\nparticipants across 4- and 8-target reaching protocols. We withheld all but the\nfirst 8 or 16 reaching trials and used ARIMA, MOMENT, and Chronos models,\nfine-tuned on 70 percent of subjects, to forecast synthetic trials. We\nrecomputed four kinematic features of reaching (reaction time, movement time,\nposture speed, maximum speed) on combined recorded plus forecasted trials and\ncompared them to full-length references using ICC(2,1).\n  Results: Chronos forecasts restored ICC >= 0.90 for all parameters with only\n8 recorded trials plus forecasts, matching the reliability of 24-28 recorded\nreaches (Delta ICC <= 0.07). MOMENT yielded intermediate gains, while ARIMA\nimprovements were minimal. Across cohorts and protocols, synthetic trials\nreplaced reaches without materially compromising feature reliability.\n  Conclusion: Foundation-model forecasting can greatly shorten Kinarm VGR\nassessment time.

Current alignment approaches often yield superficial\nconformity rather than genuine ethical understanding, failing to address the\ncomplex, context-dependent nature of human values. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel ethical reasoning paradigm for LLMs inspired by well-established ethical\ndecision-making models, aiming at enhancing diverse human value alignment\nthrough deliberative ethical reasoning. Our framework consists of a structured\nfive-step process, including contextual fact gathering, hierarchical social\nnorm identification, option generation, multiple-lens ethical impact analysis,\nand reflection. This theory-grounded approach guides LLMs through an\ninterpretable reasoning process that enhances their ability to understand\nregional specificities and perform nuanced ethical analysis, which can be\nimplemented with either prompt engineering or supervised fine-tuning methods.\nWe perform evaluations on the SafeWorld benchmark that specially designed for\nregional value alignment. Experimental results demonstrate our framework\nsignificantly improves LLM alignment with diverse human values compared to\nbaseline methods, enabling more accurate social norm identification and more\nculturally appropriate reasoning.

Findings from a Mixed-Methods Study on the Post-production Design Change Process of Navy Assets", "comment": null, "summary": "Complex engineered systems routinely face schedule and cost overruns, along\nwith poor post-deployment performance. Championed by both INCOSE and the U.S.\nDepartment of Defense (DoD), the systems engineering (SE) community has\nincreasingly looked to Digital Engineering (DE) as a potential remedy. Despite\nthis growing advocacy, most of DE's purported benefits remain anecdotal, and\nits return on investment (ROI) remains poorly understood. This research\npresents findings from a case study on a Navy SE team responsible for the\npreliminary design phase of post-production design change projects for Navy\nassets. Using a mixed-methods approach, we document why complex system\nsustainment projects are routinely late, where and to what extent schedule\nslips arise, and how a DE transformation could improve schedule adherence. This\nstudy makes three contributions. First, it identifies four archetypical\ninefficiency modes that drive schedule overruns and explains how these\nmechanisms unfold in their organizational context. Second, it quantifies the\nmagnitude and variation of schedule slips. Third, it creates a hypothetical\ndigitally transformed version of the current process, aligned with DoD DE\npolicy, and compares it to the current state to estimate potential schedule\ngains. Our findings suggest that a DE transformation could reduce the median\nproject duration by 50.1% and reduce the standard deviation by 41.5%, leading\nto faster and more predictable timelines. However, the observed gains are not\nuniform across task categories. Overall, this study provides initial\nquantitative evidence of DE's potential ROI and its value in improving the\nefficiency and predictability of complex system sustainment projects."}

Although these\nadaptations often improve performance on specialized downstream tasks, recent\nevidence indicates that they can also degrade a model's safety or fairness.\nSince different fine-tuning techniques may exert distinct effects on these\ncritical dimensions, this study undertakes a systematic assessment of their\ntrade-offs. Four widely used Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning methods, LoRA,\nIA3, Prompt-Tuning, and P-Tuning, are applied to four instruction-tuned model\nfamilies (Meta-Llama-3-8B, Qwen2.5-7B, Mistral-7B, and Gemma-7B). In total, 235\nfine-tuned variants are evaluated across eleven safety hazard categories and\nnine demographic fairness dimensions. The results show that adapter-based\napproaches (LoRA, IA3) tend to improve safety scores and are the least\ndisruptive to fairness, retaining higher accuracy and lower bias scores. In\ncontrast, prompt-based methods (Prompt-Tuning and P-Tuning) generally reduce\nsafety and cause larger fairness regressions, with decreased accuracy and\nincreased bias. Alignment shifts are strongly moderated by base model type:\nLLaMA remains stable, Qwen records modest gains, Gemma experiences the steepest\nsafety decline, and Mistral, which is released without an internal moderation\nlayer, displays the greatest variance. Improvements in safety do not\nnecessarily translate into improvements in fairness, and no single\nconfiguration optimizes all fairness metrics simultaneously, indicating an\ninherent trade-off between these objectives. These findings suggest a practical\nguideline for safety-critical deployments: begin with a well-aligned base\nmodel, favour adapter-based PEFT, and conduct category-specific audits of both\nsafety and fairness."}

During the pandemic, we have observed a spike in\ncases related to mental health, such as anxiety, stress, and depression.\nDepression significantly influences most diseases worldwide, making it\ndifficult to detect mental health conditions in people due to unawareness and\nunwillingness to consult a doctor. However, nowadays, people extensively use\nonline social media platforms to express their emotions and thoughts. Hence,\nsocial media platforms are now becoming a large data source that can be\nutilized for detecting depression and mental illness. However, existing\napproaches often overlook data sparsity in tweets and the multimodal aspects of\nsocial media. In this paper, we propose a novel multimodal framework that\ncombines textual, user-specific, and image analysis to detect depression among\nsocial media users. To provide enough context about the user's emotional state,\nwe propose (i) an extrinsic feature by harnessing the URLs present in tweets\nand (ii) extracting textual content present in images posted in tweets.

In this field, existing research predominantly adopts\nmulti-agent frameworks. However, the adoption of multi-agent frameworks\npresents challenges for scalability. Instead, the Traffic signal control (TSC)\nproblem necessitates a single-agent framework. TSC inherently relies on\ncentralized management by a single control center, which can monitor traffic\nconditions across all roads in the study area and coordinate the control of all\nintersections. This work proposes a single-agent RL-based regional ATSC model\ncompatible with probe vehicle technology. Key components of the RL design\ninclude state, action, and reward function definitions. To facilitate learning\nand manage congestion, both state and reward functions are defined based on\nqueue length, with action designed to regulate queue dynamics. The queue length\ndefinition used in this study differs slightly from conventional definitions\nbut is closely correlated with congestion states. More importantly, it allows\nfor reliable estimation using link travel time data from probe vehicles. With\nprobe vehicle data already covering most urban roads, this feature enhances the\nproposed method's potential for widespread deployment.

However, the existing\ndiffusion-based paradigm often struggles to capture strong temporal\ndependencies across multiple steps, particularly when incorporating\nproprioceptive input. This limitation can lead to task failures, where the\npolicy overfits to proprioceptive cues at the expense of capturing the visually\nderived features of the task. To overcome this challenge, we propose the Deep\nKoopman-boosted Dual-branch Diffusion Policy (D3P) algorithm. D3P introduces a\ndual-branch architecture to decouple the roles of different sensory modality\ncombinations. The visual branch encodes the visual observations to indicate\ntask progression, while the fused branch integrates both visual and\nproprioceptive inputs for precise manipulation. Within this architecture, when\nthe robot fails to accomplish intermediate goals, such as grasping a drawer\nhandle, the policy can dynamically switch to execute action chunks generated by\nthe visual branch, allowing recovery to previously observed states and\nfacilitating retrial of the task. To further enhance visual representation\nlearning, we incorporate a Deep Koopman Operator module that captures\nstructured temporal dynamics from visual inputs. During inference, we use the\ntest-time loss of the generative model as a confidence signal to guide the\naggregation of the temporally overlapping predicted action chunks, thereby\nenhancing the reliability of policy execution. In simulation experiments across\nsix RLBench tabletop tasks, D3P outperforms the state-of-the-art diffusion\npolicy by an average of 14.6\\%.

We evaluate whether time-series foundation models can replace\nunrecorded trials from an early subset of reaches while preserving the\nreliability of standard Kinarm parameters.\n  Methods: We analyzed VGR speed signals from 461 stroke and 599 control\nparticipants across 4- and 8-target reaching protocols. We withheld all but the\nfirst 8 or 16 reaching trials and used ARIMA, MOMENT, and Chronos models,\nfine-tuned on 70 percent of subjects, to forecast synthetic trials. We\nrecomputed four kinematic features of reaching (reaction time, movement time,\nposture speed, maximum speed) on combined recorded plus forecasted trials and\ncompared them to full-length references using ICC(2,1).\n  Results: Chronos forecasts restored ICC >= 0.90 for all parameters with only\n8 recorded trials plus forecasts, matching the reliability of 24-28 recorded\nreaches (Delta ICC <= 0.07).

We tested whether proprioceptively-tailored robotic training improves\nhand function and neural processing in stroke survivors. Using a robotic finger\nexoskeleton, we tested two proprioceptively-tailored approaches: Propriopixel\nTraining, which uses robot-facilitated, gamified movements to enhance\nproprioceptive processing, and Virtual Assistance Training, which reduces\nrobotic aid to increase reliance on self-generated feedback. In a randomized\ncontrolled trial, forty-six chronic stroke survivors completed nine 2-hour\nsessions of Standard, Propriopixel or Virtual training. Among participants with\nproprioceptive deficits, Propriopixel ((Box and Block Test: 7 +/- 4.2, p=0.002)\nand Virtual Assistance (4.5 +/- 4.4 , p=0.068) yielded greater gains in hand\nfunction (Standard: 0.8 +/- 2.3 blocks). Proprioceptive gains correlated with\nimprovements in hand function. Tailored training enhanced neural sensitivity to\nproprioceptive cues, evidenced by a novel EEG biomarker, the proprioceptive\nContingent Negative Variation.

Task and motion\nplanning (TAMP) is a model-based framework that addresses this challenge by\nplanning hierarchically with abstract actions (options). These options are\nmanually defined, limiting the agent to behaviors that we as human engineers\nknow how to program (pick, place, move). In this work, we propose Shortcut\nLearning for Abstract Planning (SLAP), a method that leverages existing TAMP\noptions to automatically discover new ones. Our key idea is to use model-free\nreinforcement learning (RL) to learn shortcuts in the abstract planning graph\ninduced by the existing options in TAMP. Without any additional assumptions or\ninputs, shortcut learning leads to shorter solutions than pure planning, and\nhigher task success rates than flat and hierarchical RL. Qualitatively, SLAP\ndiscovers dynamic physical improvisations (e.g., slap, wiggle, wipe) that\ndiffer significantly from the manually-defined ones. In experiments in four\nsimulated robotic environments, we show that SLAP solves and generalizes to a\nwide range of tasks, reducing overall plan lengths by over 50% and consistently\noutperforming planning and RL baselines."}

However, this task is also difficult due to the\ncomplex cognition and decision-making involved in such behavior. Recent\nresearch has begun to leverage Large Language Model (LLM) agents for this task.\nBuilding on this, we introduce a novel dual-agent framework that enables\ncontinuous learning and alignment between LLM agents and human travelers on\nlearning and adaptation behavior from online data streams. Our approach\ninvolves a set of LLM traveler agents, equipped with a memory system and a\nlearnable persona, which serve as simulators for human travelers. To ensure\nbehavioral alignment, we introduce an LLM calibration agent that leverages the\nreasoning and analytical capabilities of LLMs to train the personas of these\ntraveler agents. Working together, this dual-agent system is designed to track\nand align the underlying decision-making mechanisms of travelers and produce\nrealistic, adaptive simulations. Using a real-world dataset from a day-to-day\nroute choice experiment, we show our approach significantly outperforms\nexisting LLM-based methods in both individual behavioral alignment and\naggregate simulation accuracy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our method\nmoves beyond simple behavioral mimicry to capture the evolution of underlying\nlearning processes, a deeper alignment that fosters robust generalization.\nOverall, our framework provides a new approach for creating adaptive and\nbehaviorally realistic agents to simulate travelers' learning and adaptation\nthat can benefit transportation simulation and policy analysis."}

To overcome these limitations, we propose\nLiDAR-VGGT, a novel framework that tightly couples LiDAR inertial odometry with\nthe state-of-the-art VGGT model through a two-stage coarse- to-fine fusion\npipeline: First, a pre-fusion module with robust initialization refinement\nefficiently estimates VGGT poses and point clouds with coarse metric scale\nwithin each session. Then, a post-fusion module enhances cross-modal 3D\nsimilarity transformation, using bounding-box-based regularization to reduce\nscale distortions caused by inconsistent FOVs between LiDAR and camera sensors.\nExtensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that LiDAR-VGGT\nachieves dense, globally consistent colored point clouds and outperforms both\nVGGT-based methods and LIVO baselines. The implementation of our proposed novel\ncolor point cloud evaluation toolkit will be released as open source."}

However, this rising EV load strains the distribution\ngrid, causing severe voltage drops, particularly at feeder extremities. This\nstudy proposes a proactive voltage management (PVM) framework that can\nintegrate Monte Carlo-based simulations of varying EV charging loads to (i)\nidentify potential voltage violations through a voltage violation analysis\n(VVA) model, and (ii) then mitigate those violations with optimally-invested\nbattery energy storage systems (BESS) through an optimal expansion planning\n(OEP) model. A novel spatio-temporal adaptive targeting (STAT) strategy is\nproposed to alleviate the computational complexity of the OEP model by defining\na targeted OEP (T-OEP) model, solved by applying the OEP model to (i) a reduced\nset of representative critical time periods and (ii) candidate BESS\ninstallation nodes.

In this study, we introduce two Knowledge\nElicitation methods designed to overcome these limitations by enabling large\nlanguage models (LLMs) to induce and apply domain-specific rules for cancer\nstaging.

Traditional path planners, which treat the environment as a\ngeometric grid, often suffer from redundant searches and are prone to failure\nin complex scenarios due to their lack of semantic understanding. To overcome\nthese limitations, we reframe path planning in unknown environments as a\nsemantic reasoning task.

Despite advancements in algorithm design, existing\napproaches suffer from two critical limitations: insufficient learning of\nnoise-contaminated unimodal data, leading to corrupted cross-modal\ninteractions, and inadequate fusion of multimodal representations, resulting in\ndiscarding discriminative unimodal information while retaining multimodal\nredundant information. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a\nDouble Information Bottleneck (DIB) strategy to obtain a powerful, unified\ncompact multimodal representation. Implemented within the framework of low-rank\nRenyi's entropy functional, DIB offers enhanced robustness against diverse\nnoise sources and computational tractability for high-dimensional data, as\ncompared to the conventional Shannon entropy-based methods. The DIB comprises\ntwo key modules: 1) learning a sufficient and compressed representation of\nindividual unimodal data by maximizing the task-relevant information and\ndiscarding the superfluous information, and 2) ensuring the discriminative\nability of multimodal representation through a novel attention bottleneck\nfusion mechanism. Consequently, DIB yields a multimodal representation that\neffectively filters out noisy information from unimodal data while capturing\ninter-modal complementarity. Extensive experiments on CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI,\nCH-SIMS, and MVSA-Single validate the effectiveness of our method.

However, the existing\ndiffusion-based paradigm often struggles to capture strong temporal\ndependencies across multiple steps, particularly when incorporating\nproprioceptive input. This limitation can lead to task failures, where the\npolicy overfits to proprioceptive cues at the expense of capturing the visually\nderived features of the task. To overcome this challenge, we propose the Deep\nKoopman-boosted Dual-branch Diffusion Policy (D3P) algorithm. D3P introduces a\ndual-branch architecture to decouple the roles of different sensory modality\ncombinations. The visual branch encodes the visual observations to indicate\ntask progression, while the fused branch integrates both visual and\nproprioceptive inputs for precise manipulation. Within this architecture, when\nthe robot fails to accomplish intermediate goals, such as grasping a drawer\nhandle, the policy can dynamically switch to execute action chunks generated by\nthe visual branch, allowing recovery to previously observed states and\nfacilitating retrial of the task. To further enhance visual representation\nlearning, we incorporate a Deep Koopman Operator module that captures\nstructured temporal dynamics from visual inputs. During inference, we use the\ntest-time loss of the generative model as a confidence signal to guide the\naggregation of the temporally overlapping predicted action chunks, thereby\nenhancing the reliability of policy execution.

To support this, we first\nconstruct a large-scale Chain-of-Thought (CoT)-style personalized assessment\ndataset annotated with diverse user preference profiles and high-quality\nCoT-style reasoning, enabling explicit supervision of structured reasoning.\nNext, we adopt a two-stage training strategy: a cold-start supervised\nfine-tuning phase to empower the model with structured reasoning capabilities,\nfollowed by reinforcement learning to incentivize the model to explore more\nreasonable assessment paths and enhance generalization. Furthermore, we propose\na similarity-aware prediction reward to encourage better prediction of the\nuser's preference profile, which facilitates more reasonable assessments\nexploration.

In this paper, we present GauDP, a novel\nGaussian-image synergistic representation that facilitates scalable,\nperception-aware imitation learning in multi-agent collaborative systems.\nSpecifically, GauDP constructs a globally consistent 3D Gaussian field from\ndecentralized RGB observations, then dynamically redistributes 3D Gaussian\nattributes to each agent's local perspective. This enables all agents to\nadaptively query task-critical features from the shared scene representation\nwhile maintaining their individual viewpoints. This design facilitates both\nfine-grained control and globally coherent behavior without requiring\nadditional sensing modalities (e.g., 3D point cloud). We evaluate GauDP on the\nRoboFactory benchmark, which includes diverse multi-arm manipulation tasks. Our\nmethod achieves superior performance over existing image-based methods and\napproaches the effectiveness of point-cloud-driven methods, while maintaining\nstrong scalability as the number of agents increases."}

The trap closure is triggered by\ntwo consecutive touches of a potential prey, after which the lobes rapidly\nswitch from their concave open-state to their convex close-state and catch the\nprey within 100-500 ms after being triggered. This transformation from concave\nto convex is initiated by changes in turgor pressure and the release of stored\nelastic energy from prestresses in the concave state, which accelerate this\nmovement, leading to inversion of the lobes bi-axial curvature. Possessing two\nlow-energy states, the leaves can be characterized as bistable systems. With\nour research, we seek to deepen the understanding of Venus flytrap motion\nmechanics and apply its principles to the design of an artificial bistable lobe\nactuator.

This review examines this convergence across three\nprinciples: automaticity, in which responses emerge from associative rather\nthan deliberative processes; suppressed monitoring, leading to errors such as\nconfabulation in hypnosis and hallucination in LLMs; and heightened contextual\ndependency, where immediate cues (for example, the suggestion of a therapist or\nthe prompt of the user) override stable knowledge.\n  These mechanisms reveal an observer-relative meaning gap: both systems\nproduce coherent but ungrounded outputs that require an external interpreter to\nsupply meaning. Hypnosis and LLMs also exemplify functional agency - the\ncapacity for complex, goal-directed, context-sensitive behavior - without\nsubjective agency, the conscious awareness of intention and ownership that\ndefines human action. This distinction clarifies how purposive behavior can\nemerge without self-reflective consciousness, governed instead by structural\nand contextual dynamics.

Evaluated on 1,372 validated electronic health\nrecords from a Chinese medical platform across multiple foundation models\n(GPT-OSS 20B, Qwen3-8B, Phi4-14B), the framework achieved 87.0% accuracy for\nprimary department triage and 80.5% for secondary department classification,\nwith task completion rates reaching 98.2% using agent-driven scheduling versus\n93.1% with sequential processing. Clinical quality scores from 18 physicians\naveraged 4.56 for Chief Complaints, 4.48 for History of Present Illness, and\n4.69 for Past History on a 5-point scale, with consultations completed within\n12.7 rounds for $T_2$ and 16.9 rounds for $T_3$. The model-agnostic\narchitecture maintained high performance across different foundation models\nwhile preserving data privacy through local deployment, demonstrating the\npotential for autonomous AI systems to enhance pre-consultation efficiency and\nquality in clinical settings."}

While prior work in evolutionary game theory has primarily\nfocused on static games without individual player state dynamics, we present\nthe first comprehensive evolutionary analysis of such dynamic games. We propose\nan evolutionary model together with a mean field approximation of the\nfinite-population game and establish strong approximation guarantees. We show\nthat standard solution concepts for dynamic games lack an evolutionary\ninterpretation, and we propose a new concept - the Mixed Stationary Nash\nEquilibrium (MSNE) - which admits one.

This paper introduces TPS-Bench to benchmark the ability of\nLLM agents in solving such problems that demand Tool Planning and Scheduling.\nTPS-Bench collects 200 compounding tasks of two difficulty levels, based on a\ntool repository containing hundreds of model context protocol (MCP) tools. In\nparticular, each task is composed of multiple subtasks, such as web search, map\nnavigation, calendar checking, etc., and each subtask can be completed by a\nbasic tool.

Collaborative work between the Robotics and\n  Mechanisms Laboratory (RoMeLa) and Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories\n  (MERL)", "summary": "This article presents a Multi-Modal Bipedal Intelligent Urban Scout robot\n(MOBIUS) capable of walking, crawling, climbing, and rolling. MOBIUS features\nfour limbs--two 6-DoF arms with two-finger grippers for manipulation and\nclimbing, and two 4-DoF legs for locomotion--enabling smooth transitions across\ndiverse terrains without reconfiguration. A hybrid control architecture\ncombines reinforcement learning-based locomotion with model-based predictive\nand admittance control enhanced for safety by a Reference Governor toward\ncompliant contact interactions. A high-level MIQCP planner autonomously selects\nlocomotion modes to balance stability and energy efficiency. Hardware\nexperiments demonstrate robust gait transitions, dynamic climbing, and\nfull-body load support via pinch grasp. Overall, MOBIUS demonstrates the\nimportance of tight integration between morphology, high-level planning, and\ncontrol to enable mobile loco-manipulation and grasping, substantially\nexpanding its interaction capabilities, workspace, and traversability."}

Meanwhile, dexterous\nmanipulation tasks are inherently more difficult due to their higher degrees of\nfreedom. Massively generating feasible and trainable dexterous hand tasks\nremains an open challenge. To this end, we present GenDexHand, a generative\nsimulation pipeline that autonomously produces diverse robotic tasks and\nenvironments for dexterous manipulation. GenDexHand introduces a closed-loop\nrefinement process that adjusts object placements and scales based on\nvision-language model (VLM) feedback, substantially improving the average\nquality of generated environments. Each task is further decomposed into\nsub-tasks to enable sequential reinforcement learning, reducing training time\nand increasing success rates. Our work provides a viable path toward scalable\ntraining of diverse dexterous hand behaviors in embodied intelligence by\noffering a simulation-based solution to synthetic data generation.

CSI readings are converted\ninto synthetic images using the TINTO tool. The localisation solution is\nintegrated with a robotics simulator, and the Robot Operating System (ROS),\nwhich facilitates its evaluation through heterogeneous test cases, and the\nadoption of state estimators like Kalman filters.

In this paper, we demonstrate that LLMs\ncan simulate realistic environment feedback without access to actual testbed\ndata or APIs. Inspired by this capability, we propose two frameworks:\nSimia-SFT, a pipeline that synthesizes SFT data by amplifying small seed sets\ninto diverse trajectories in an environment-agnostic manner, and Simia-RL, a\nframework that enables RL training without real environment implementations\nthrough LLM-simulated feedback. Fine-tuning open models yields consistent\nimprovements across multiple benchmarks, surpassing GPT-4o and approaching\no4-mini on $\\tau^2$-Bench. Together, Simia-SFT and Simia-RL enable scalable\nagent training without environment engineering, replacing heavy and brittle\nimplementations with flexible LLM-based simulation."}

This study investigates how different LLMs respond to\nvalidated surveys about the role of ethics and responsibility for businesses,\nand the importance of sustainable practices and relations with suppliers and\ncustomers. Using standardized questionnaires, we systematically analyze\nresponses generated by state-of-the-art LLMs to identify variations. We further\nevaluate whether differences are augmented by four organizational culture\ntypes, thereby evaluating the practical relevance of identified biases. The\nfindings reveal significant systematic differences between models and\ndemonstrate that organizational culture prompts substantially modify LLM\nresponses.

We decompose this position into two orthogonal\ndimensions: \\textit{spatial novelty}, which measures a paper's intellectual\ndistinctiveness from its neighbors, and \\textit{temporal novelty}, which\ncaptures its engagement with a dynamic research frontier. To operationalize\nthese concepts, we leverage Large Language Models to develop semantic isolation\nmetrics that quantify a paper's location relative to the full-text literature.\nApplying this framework to a large corpus of economics articles, we uncover a\nfundamental trade-off: these two dimensions predict systematically different\noutcomes. Temporal novelty primarily predicts citation counts, whereas spatial\nnovelty predicts disruptive impact. This distinction allows us to construct a\ntypology of semantic neighborhoods, identifying four archetypes associated with\ndistinct and predictable impact profiles. Our findings demonstrate that novelty\ncan be understood as a multidimensional construct whose different forms,\nreflecting a paper's strategic location, have measurable and fundamentally\ndistinct consequences for scientific progress."}

In such settings,\nunsupervised analysis is often of interest, in that the researcher does not\nwant to pre-specify the objects of measurement or otherwise artificially\ndelimit the space of measurable concepts; they are interested in discovery.\nThis paper proposes a general and flexible framework for pursuing discovery\nfrom unstructured data in a statistically principled way. The framework\nleverages recent methods from the literature on machine learning\ninterpretability to map unstructured data points to high-dimensional, sparse,\nand interpretable dictionaries of concepts; computes (test) statistics of these\ndictionary entries; and then performs selective inference on them using newly\ndeveloped statistical procedures for high-dimensional exceedance control of the\n$k$-FWER under arbitrary dependence. The proposed framework has few researcher\ndegrees of freedom, is fully replicable, and is cheap to implement -- both in\nterms of financial cost and researcher time. Applications to recent descriptive\nand causal analyses of unstructured data in empirical economics are explored.\nAn open source Jupyter notebook is provided for researchers to implement the\nframework in their own projects."}
