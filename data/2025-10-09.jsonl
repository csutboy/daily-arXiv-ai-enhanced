Unlike conventional leader-follower schemes that fix the\nfollower's position relative to the leader, the follower is steered to maintain\nrange and bearing angles (which is the angle between its velocity vector and\nits line-of-sight (LOS) with respect to the leader) arbitrarily close to the\nprescribed values, enabling the follower to maintain formation on a\nhemispherical region behind the leader. The proposed IGC framework directly\nmaps leader-follower relative range dynamics to throttle commands, and the\nfollower's velocity orientation relative to the LOS to aerodynamic control\nsurface deflections. This enables synergism between guidance and control\nsubsystems. The control design uses a dynamic surface control-based\nbackstepping approach to achieve convergence to the desired formation set,\nwhere Lyapunov barrier functions are incorporated to ensure the follower's\nbearing angle is constrained within specified bounds. Rigorous stability\nanalysis guarantees uniform ultimate boundedness of all error states and strict\nconstraint satisfaction in the presence of aerodynamic nonlinearities. The\nproposed flexible formation scheme allows the follower to have an orientation\nmismatch relative to the leader to execute anticipatory reconfiguration by\ntransitioning between the relative positions in the admissible formation set\nwhen the leader aggressively maneuvers. The proposed IGC law relies only on\nrelative information and onboard sensors without the information about the\nleader's maneuver, making it suitable for GPS-denied or non-cooperative\nscenarios. Finally, we present simulation results to vindicate the\neffectiveness and robustness of our approach."}

This study investigates the central paradox of the\nsuccess of this student-led civilian uprising: how state violence, intended to\nquell dissent, ultimately fueled the movement's victory. We employ a\nmixed-methods approach. First, we develop a qualitative narrative of the\nconflict's timeline to generate specific, testable hypotheses. Then, using a\ndisaggregated, event-level dataset, we employ a multi-method quantitative\nanalysis to dissect the complex relationship between repression and\nmobilisation. We provide a framework to analyse explosive modern uprisings like\nthe July Revolution. Initial pooled regression models highlight the crucial\nrole of protest momentum in sustaining the movement. To isolate causal effects,\nwe specify a Two-Way Fixed Effects panel model, which provides robust evidence\nfor a direct and statistically significant local suppression backfire effect.\nOur Vector Autoregression (VAR) analysis provides clear visual evidence of an\nimmediate, nationwide mobilisation in response to increased lethal violence. We\nfurther demonstrate that this effect was non-linear. A structural break\nanalysis reveals that the backfire dynamic was statistically insignificant in\nthe conflict's early phase but was triggered by the catalytic moral shock of\nthe first wave of lethal violence, and its visuals circulated around July 16th.\nA complementary machine learning analysis (XGBoost, out-of-sample R$^{2}$=0.65)\ncorroborates this from a predictive standpoint, identifying \"excessive force\nagainst protesters\" as the single most dominant predictor of nationwide\nescalation. We conclude that the July Revolution was driven by a contingent,\nnon-linear backfire, triggered by specific catalytic moral shocks and\naccelerated by the viral reaction to the visual spectacle of state brutality."}

Due to this uncertainty, a model that\ncould well predict the distribution information at one point in time may\nperform less accurately compared to another model at a different time. To solve\nthis problem, we investigate a method for portfolio optimization based on\nBayesian predictive synthesis (BPS), one of the Bayesian ensemble methods for\nmeta-learning.

This\nassumption is violated when individuals temporarily leave the sampling area and\nreturn during later capture occasions, which can result in biased or less\nprecise inferences under normal capture-recapture models. Existing temporary\nemigration models require that individuals are uniquely and correctly\nidentified. To our knowledge, no studies to date have addressed temporary\nemigration in the presence of latent individual identification, which can arise\nin many scenarios such as misidentification, data integration, and batch\nmarking. In this paper, we propose a new latent multinomial temporary\nemigration modelling framework for analysing capture-recapture data with latent\nidentification. The framework is applicable to both closed- and open-population\nproblems, accommodates data with or without individual identification, and\nflexibly incorporates different emigration processes, including the completely\nrandom and Markovian emigration. Through simulations, we demonstrate that model\nparameters can be reliably estimated in various emigration scenarios. We apply\nthe proposed framework to a real dataset on golden mantella collected using\nbatch marks under Pollock's robust design. The results show that accounting for\ntemporary emigration provides a better fit to the data compared to the previous\nmodel without temporary emigration."}

Robust planning ensures safety by considering worst-case\nrealizations, yet ignores uncertainty reduction and leads to overly\nconservative behavior. Actively reducing uncertainty on-the-fly during a\nnominal mission defines the dual control problem. Most approaches address this\nby adding a weighted exploration term to the cost, tuned to trade off the\nnominal objective and uncertainty reduction, but without formal consideration\nof when exploration is beneficial. Moreover, safety is enforced in some methods\nbut not in others. We propose a framework that integrates robust planning with\nactive exploration under formal guarantees as follows: The key innovation and\ncontribution is that exploration is pursued only when it provides a verifiable\nimprovement without compromising safety. To achieve this, we utilize our\nearlier work on gatekeeper as an architecture for safety verification, and\nextend it so that it generates both safe and informative trajectories that\nreduce uncertainty and the cost of the mission, or keep it within a\nuser-defined budget.

Unlike conventional leader-follower schemes that fix the\nfollower's position relative to the leader, the follower is steered to maintain\nrange and bearing angles (which is the angle between its velocity vector and\nits line-of-sight (LOS) with respect to the leader) arbitrarily close to the\nprescribed values, enabling the follower to maintain formation on a\nhemispherical region behind the leader. The proposed IGC framework directly\nmaps leader-follower relative range dynamics to throttle commands, and the\nfollower's velocity orientation relative to the LOS to aerodynamic control\nsurface deflections. This enables synergism between guidance and control\nsubsystems. The control design uses a dynamic surface control-based\nbackstepping approach to achieve convergence to the desired formation set,\nwhere Lyapunov barrier functions are incorporated to ensure the follower's\nbearing angle is constrained within specified bounds. Rigorous stability\nanalysis guarantees uniform ultimate boundedness of all error states and strict\nconstraint satisfaction in the presence of aerodynamic nonlinearities. The\nproposed flexible formation scheme allows the follower to have an orientation\nmismatch relative to the leader to execute anticipatory reconfiguration by\ntransitioning between the relative positions in the admissible formation set\nwhen the leader aggressively maneuvers. The proposed IGC law relies only on\nrelative information and onboard sensors without the information about the\nleader's maneuver, making it suitable for GPS-denied or non-cooperative\nscenarios.

This shift raises a fundamental\nquestion: how do machine agents behave in interdependent environments where\noutcomes depend not only on their own choices but also on the coordinated\nexpectations of peers? To address this question, we study LLM agents in a\ncanonical network-effect game, where economic theory predicts convergence to a\nfulfilled expectation equilibrium (FEE). We design an experimental framework in\nwhich 50 heterogeneous GPT-5-based agents repeatedly interact under\nsystematically varied network-effect strengths, price trajectories, and\ndecision-history lengths. The results reveal that LLM agents systematically\ndiverge from FEE: they underestimate participation at low prices, overestimate\nat high prices, and sustain persistent dispersion.

Simple monotonic histories-where past\noutcomes follow a steady upward or downward trend-help stabilize coordination,\nwhereas nonmonotonic histories amplify divergence and path dependence.\nRegression analyses at the individual level further show that price is the\ndominant driver of deviation, history moderates this effect, and network\neffects amplify contextual distortions.

Yet, unlike learning, where generalization and out of\ndistribution (OoD) evaluation concepts are well formalized, there is no clear,\nconsistent definition or metric for reasoning ability. We propose Complexity\nOut of Distribution (Complexity OoD) generalization as a framework and problem\nsetting to define and measure reasoning. A model exhibits Complexity OoD\ngeneralization when it maintains performance on test instances whose minimal\nrequired solution complexity, either representational (richer solution\nstructure) or computational (more reasoning steps/program length), exceeds that\nof all training examples. We formalize complexity via solution description\nKolmogorov complexity and operational proxies (e.g., object/relation counts;\nreasoning step counts), clarifying how Complexity OoD differs from length and\ncompositional OoD. This lens unifies learning and reasoning: many cases\nsolvable with System1 like processing at low complexity become System2 like\nunder complexity pressure, while System2 can be viewed as generalization over\nsolution structures. We translate this perspective into practice with\nrecommendations for operationalizing Complexity OoD across the stack:\nincorporating complexity into benchmark and evaluation metric design,\nrethinking supervision to target solution traces, seeking and designing\ninductive biases for Complexity OoD generalization, addressing learning to\nreason spillovers such as spurious shortcuts, semantic robustness, catastrophic\nforgetting, and step wise calibration.

In view of this, we contribute to real\ndemand estimation for shared micro-mobility services by proposing an analytical\nmethod that rigorously derives the real demand under appropriate assumptions.\nRather than directly modeling the intractable relationship between observed\ndemand and real demand, we propose a novel random variable, Generalized Vehicle\nSurvival Time (GVST), which is observable from trip records. The relationship\nbetween GVST and real demand is characterized by introducing a flipped queueing\nmodel (FQM) that captures the operational dynamics of shared micro-mobility\nservices.

To solve novel problems, agents should acquire skills for\nexploring and learning through experience. Finding a scalable learning\nmechanism for developing agents that learn through interaction remains a major\nopen problem. In this work, we introduce BuilderBench, a benchmark to\naccelerate research into agent pre-training that centers open-ended\nexploration. BuilderBench requires agents to learn how to build any structure\nusing blocks. BuilderBench is equipped with $(1)$ a hardware accelerated\nsimulator of a robotic agent interacting with various physical blocks, and\n$(2)$ a task-suite with over 42 diverse target structures that are carefully\ncurated to test an understanding of physics, mathematics, and long-horizon\nplanning. During training, agents have to explore and learn general principles\nabout the environment without any external supervision. During evaluation,\nagents have to build the unseen target structures from the task suite. Solving\nthese tasks requires a sort of \\emph{embodied reasoning} that is not reflected\nin words but rather in actions, experimenting with different strategies and\npiecing them together. Our experiments show that many of these tasks challenge\nthe current iteration of algorithms. Hence, we also provide a ``training\nwheels'' protocol, in which agents are trained and evaluated to build a single\ntarget structure from the task suite. Finally, we provide single-file\nimplementations of six different algorithms as a reference point for\nresearchers."}

This transparency also opens a promising\ndirection: multiple reasoners can directly collaborate on each other's thinking\nwithin a shared trajectory, yielding better inference efficiency and\nexploration. A key prerequisite, however, is the ability to assess the\nusefulness and build on another model's partial thinking -- we call this\noff-trajectory reasoning. Our paper investigates a critical question: can\nstandard solo-reasoning training pipelines deliver desired off-trajectory\nbehaviors? We propose twin tests that capture the two extremes of the\noff-trajectory spectrum, namely Recoverability, which tests whether LLMs can\nbacktrack from \"distractions\" induced by misleading reasoning traces, and\nGuidability, which tests their ability to build upon correct reasoning from\nstronger collaborators. Our study evaluates 15 open-weight LLMs (1.5B-32B) and\nreveals a counterintuitive finding -- \"stronger\" LLMs on benchmarks are often\nmore fragile under distraction. Moreover, all models tested fail to effectively\nleverage guiding steps from collaborators on problems beyond their inherent\ncapabilities with solve rates remaining under 9.2%. Finally, we conduct control\nstudies to isolate the effects of three factors in post-training on these\nbehaviors: the choice of distillation teacher, the use of RL, and data\nselection strategy. Our results provide actionable insights for training\nnatively strong reasoning collaborators; e.g., we find that suboptimal\nrecoverability behaviors of teacher models are transferred to distilled\nstudents even if the distillation trajectories are correct.

We propose Complexity\nOut of Distribution (Complexity OoD) generalization as a framework and problem\nsetting to define and measure reasoning. A model exhibits Complexity OoD\ngeneralization when it maintains performance on test instances whose minimal\nrequired solution complexity, either representational (richer solution\nstructure) or computational (more reasoning steps/program length), exceeds that\nof all training examples. We formalize complexity via solution description\nKolmogorov complexity and operational proxies (e.g., object/relation counts;\nreasoning step counts), clarifying how Complexity OoD differs from length and\ncompositional OoD. This lens unifies learning and reasoning: many cases\nsolvable with System1 like processing at low complexity become System2 like\nunder complexity pressure, while System2 can be viewed as generalization over\nsolution structures. We translate this perspective into practice with\nrecommendations for operationalizing Complexity OoD across the stack:\nincorporating complexity into benchmark and evaluation metric design,\nrethinking supervision to target solution traces, seeking and designing\ninductive biases for Complexity OoD generalization, addressing learning to\nreason spillovers such as spurious shortcuts, semantic robustness, catastrophic\nforgetting, and step wise calibration.

Recent\nadvances have enabled language-guided tracking in complex and unstructured\nscenes. However, existing approaches lack explicit spatial reasoning and\neffective temporal memory, causing failures under severe occlusions or in the\npresence of similar-looking distractors. To address these challenges, we\npresent TrackVLA++, a novel Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model that enhances\nembodied visual tracking with two key modules, a spatial reasoning mechanism\nand a Target Identification Memory (TIM). The reasoning module introduces a\nChain-of-Thought paradigm, termed Polar-CoT, which infers the target's relative\nposition and encodes it as a compact polar-coordinate token for action\nprediction. Guided by these spatial priors, the TIM employs a gated update\nstrategy to preserve long-horizon target memory, ensuring spatiotemporal\nconsistency and mitigating target loss during extended occlusions.

Unlike conventional leader-follower schemes that fix the\nfollower's position relative to the leader, the follower is steered to maintain\nrange and bearing angles (which is the angle between its velocity vector and\nits line-of-sight (LOS) with respect to the leader) arbitrarily close to the\nprescribed values, enabling the follower to maintain formation on a\nhemispherical region behind the leader. The proposed IGC framework directly\nmaps leader-follower relative range dynamics to throttle commands, and the\nfollower's velocity orientation relative to the LOS to aerodynamic control\nsurface deflections. This enables synergism between guidance and control\nsubsystems. The control design uses a dynamic surface control-based\nbackstepping approach to achieve convergence to the desired formation set,\nwhere Lyapunov barrier functions are incorporated to ensure the follower's\nbearing angle is constrained within specified bounds. Rigorous stability\nanalysis guarantees uniform ultimate boundedness of all error states and strict\nconstraint satisfaction in the presence of aerodynamic nonlinearities. The\nproposed flexible formation scheme allows the follower to have an orientation\nmismatch relative to the leader to execute anticipatory reconfiguration by\ntransitioning between the relative positions in the admissible formation set\nwhen the leader aggressively maneuvers. The proposed IGC law relies only on\nrelative information and onboard sensors without the information about the\nleader's maneuver, making it suitable for GPS-denied or non-cooperative\nscenarios. Finally, we present simulation results to vindicate the\neffectiveness and robustness of our approach."}

However, existing\nbenchmarks for this task suffer from a fundamental methodological trilemma,\nforcing a trade-off between scientific relevance, scalability, and resistance\nto memorization. Furthermore, they oversimplify discovery as static function\nfitting, failing to capture the authentic scientific process of uncovering\nembedded laws through the interactive exploration of complex model systems. To\naddress these critical gaps, we introduce NewtonBench, a benchmark comprising\n324 scientific law discovery tasks across 12 physics domains. Our design\nmitigates the evaluation trilemma by using metaphysical shifts - systematic\nalterations of canonical laws - to generate a vast suite of problems that are\nscalable, scientifically relevant, and memorization-resistant. Moreover, we\nelevate the evaluation from static function fitting to interactive model\ndiscovery, requiring agents to experimentally probe simulated complex systems\nto uncover hidden principles. Our extensive experiment reveals a clear but\nfragile capability for discovery in frontier LLMs: this ability degrades\nprecipitously with increasing system complexity and exhibits extreme\nsensitivity to observational noise.

Rather than attempting to internalize\ncomplex geometric operations within neural networks, TIGeR empowers models to\nrecognize geometric reasoning requirements, synthesize appropriate\ncomputational code, and invoke specialized libraries for exact calculations. To\nsupport this paradigm, we introduce TIGeR-300K, a comprehensive\ntool-invocation-oriented dataset covering point transformations, pose\nestimation, trajectory generation, and spatial compatibility verification,\ncomplete with tool invocation sequences and intermediate computations. Through\na two-stage training pipeline combining supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and\nreinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) with our proposed hierarchical reward design,\nTIGeR achieves SOTA performance on geometric reasoning benchmarks while\ndemonstrating centimeter-level precision in real-world robotic manipulation\ntasks."}

The\ncentral challenge is therefore to select a representative set of LLM agents\nfrom the exponentially large space of possible agents. We tackle this selection\nproblem from the lens of submodular optimization. In particular, we develop\nmethods that offer different trade-offs regarding time complexity and\nperformance guarantees. Extensive experiments in crowdsourcing and educational\ndomains demonstrate that our approach constructs agents that more effectively\nrepresent human populations compared to baselines.

Moreover, we\nelevate the evaluation from static function fitting to interactive model\ndiscovery, requiring agents to experimentally probe simulated complex systems\nto uncover hidden principles. Our extensive experiment reveals a clear but\nfragile capability for discovery in frontier LLMs: this ability degrades\nprecipitously with increasing system complexity and exhibits extreme\nsensitivity to observational noise. Notably, we uncover a paradoxical effect of\ntool assistance: providing a code interpreter can hinder more capable models by\ninducing a premature shift from exploration to exploitation, causing them to\nsatisfice on suboptimal solutions. These results demonstrate that robust,\ngeneralizable discovery in complex, interactive environments remains the core\nchallenge. By providing a scalable, robust, and scientifically authentic\ntestbed, NewtonBench offers a crucial tool for measuring true progress and\nguiding the development of next-generation AI agents capable of genuine\nscientific discovery."}

Current\napproaches fail to leverage metric cues from depth sensors and camera\ncalibration, instead reducing geometric problems to pattern recognition tasks\nthat cannot deliver the centimeter-level accuracy essential for robotic\nmanipulation. We present TIGeR (Tool-Integrated Geometric Reasoning), a novel\nframework that transforms VLMs from perceptual estimators to geometric\ncomputers by enabling them to generate and execute precise geometric\ncomputations through external tools. Rather than attempting to internalize\ncomplex geometric operations within neural networks, TIGeR empowers models to\nrecognize geometric reasoning requirements, synthesize appropriate\ncomputational code, and invoke specialized libraries for exact calculations. To\nsupport this paradigm, we introduce TIGeR-300K, a comprehensive\ntool-invocation-oriented dataset covering point transformations, pose\nestimation, trajectory generation, and spatial compatibility verification,\ncomplete with tool invocation sequences and intermediate computations.

The framework minimizes mass and actuator width while\nmaximizing efficiency, and further automates actuator CAD generation to enable\ndirect 3D printing without manual redesign. Using this framework, optimal\ngearbox designs are explored over a wide range of gear ratios, providing\ninsights into the suitability of different gearbox types across various gear\nratio ranges. In addition, the framework is used to generate CAD models of all\nfour gearbox types with varying gear ratios and motors. Two actuator types are\nfabricated and experimentally evaluated through power efficiency, no-load\nbacklash, and transmission stiffness tests. Experimental results indicate that\nthe SSPG actuator achieves a mechanical efficiency of 60-80 %, a no-load\nbacklash of 0.59 deg, and a transmission stiffness of 242.7 Nm/rad, while the\nCPG actuator demonstrates 60 % efficiency, 2.6 deg backlash, and a stiffness of\n201.6 Nm/rad.

They do not explicitly optimize for user-defined preferences, even\nwhen the preferences are available, and scale poorly with the number of\nobjectives. We propose a lexicographic framework for modeling MO-MAPF, along\nwith an algorithm \\textit{Lexicographic Conflict-Based Search} (LCBS) that\ndirectly computes a single solution aligned with a lexicographic preference\nover objectives.

Final version may vary from this preprint", "summary": "The 2024 July Revolution in Bangladesh represents a landmark event in the\nstudy of civil resistance. This study investigates the central paradox of the\nsuccess of this student-led civilian uprising: how state violence, intended to\nquell dissent, ultimately fueled the movement's victory. We employ a\nmixed-methods approach. First, we develop a qualitative narrative of the\nconflict's timeline to generate specific, testable hypotheses. Then, using a\ndisaggregated, event-level dataset, we employ a multi-method quantitative\nanalysis to dissect the complex relationship between repression and\nmobilisation. We provide a framework to analyse explosive modern uprisings like\nthe July Revolution. Initial pooled regression models highlight the crucial\nrole of protest momentum in sustaining the movement. To isolate causal effects,\nwe specify a Two-Way Fixed Effects panel model, which provides robust evidence\nfor a direct and statistically significant local suppression backfire effect.\nOur Vector Autoregression (VAR) analysis provides clear visual evidence of an\nimmediate, nationwide mobilisation in response to increased lethal violence. We\nfurther demonstrate that this effect was non-linear. A structural break\nanalysis reveals that the backfire dynamic was statistically insignificant in\nthe conflict's early phase but was triggered by the catalytic moral shock of\nthe first wave of lethal violence, and its visuals circulated around July 16th.\nA complementary machine learning analysis (XGBoost, out-of-sample R$^{2}$=0.65)\ncorroborates this from a predictive standpoint, identifying \"excessive force\nagainst protesters\" as the single most dominant predictor of nationwide\nescalation. We conclude that the July Revolution was driven by a contingent,\nnon-linear backfire, triggered by specific catalytic moral shocks and\naccelerated by the viral reaction to the visual spectacle of state brutality."}

Most existing\nportfolio optimization methods require information on the distribution of\nreturns of the assets that make up the portfolio. However, such distribution\ninformation is usually unknown to investors. Various methods have been proposed\nto estimate distribution information, but their accuracy greatly depends on the\nuncertainty of the financial markets. Due to this uncertainty, a model that\ncould well predict the distribution information at one point in time may\nperform less accurately compared to another model at a different time. To solve\nthis problem, we investigate a method for portfolio optimization based on\nBayesian predictive synthesis (BPS), one of the Bayesian ensemble methods for\nmeta-learning. We assume that investors have access to multiple asset return\nprediction models. By using BPS with dynamic linear models to combine these\npredictions, we can obtain a Bayesian predictive posterior about the mean\nrewards of assets that accommodate the uncertainty of the financial markets. In\nthis study, we examine how to construct mean-variance portfolios and\nquantile-based portfolios based on the predicted distribution information."}
