However, a formal proof of this relationship has been\nlimited to D'Antoni's work, which applies only to the strict preference case,\ni.e., where indifference between alternatives is not allowed. In this paper, we\ngeneralise D'Antoni's methodology to prove in full (i.e., accounting for weak\npreferences) that Arrow's Impossibility Theorem can be equivalently stated in\nterms of contradictory preference cycles. This methodology involves explicitly\nconstructing profiles that lead to preference cycles. Using this framework, we\nalso prove a number of additional facts regarding social welfare functions.

We\ndevelop several bivariate stochastic dominance criteria for ranking policy\noutcomes that are sensitive to features of the joint distribution of\nindividuals' income changes and absolute incomes.

These challenges\nmake an accurate credit risk assessment by lenders crucial, particularly since\nSMEs frequently operate within interconnected firm networks through which\ndefault risk can propagate. This paper presents and tests a novel approach for\nmodelling the risk of SME credit, using a unique large data set of SME loans\nprovided by a prominent financial institution. Specifically, our approach\nemploys Graph Neural Networks to predict SME default using multilayer network\ndata derived from common ownership and financial transactions between firms.

A recent National\nAcademies report on modernizing PMP estimation proposed using huge climate\nmodel-based ensembles to estimate extreme quantiles, possibly through machine\nlearning-based ensemble boosting. Here we assess such an approach for the\ncontiguous United States using a huge ensemble (10560 years) from a\nstate-of-the-art emulator (ACE2) trained on ERA5 reanalysis. The results\nindicate that one can practically estimate very extreme precipitation and\ntemperature quantiles using appropriate statistical extreme value techniques.\nMore specifically, the results provide evidence for (1) the use of\nthreshold-exceedance methods with a sufficiently high threshold for reliable\nestimation (necessary for precipitation), (2) the robustness of results to\nvariations in extremes by season and storm type, and (3) well-constrained\nstatistical uncertainty.

There are two main problems in the\ntask of predicting the dynamic evolution of complex networks: on the one hand,\nexisting methods usually use simple graphs to describe the relationships in\ncomplex networks; however, this approach can only capture pairwise\nrelationships, while there may be rich non-pairwise structured relationships in\nthe network. First-order GNNs have difficulty in capturing dynamic non-pairwise\nrelationships. On the other hand, theoretical prediction models lack accuracy\nand data-driven prediction models lack interpretability. To address the above\nproblems, this paper proposes a higher-order network dynamics identification\nmethod for long-term dynamic prediction of complex networks. Firstly, to\naddress the problem that traditional graph machine learning can only deal with\npairwise relations, dynamic hypergraph learning is introduced to capture the\nhigher-order non-pairwise relations among complex networks and improve the\naccuracy of complex network modelling. Then, a dual-driven dynamic prediction\nmodule for physical data is proposed. The Koopman operator theory is introduced\nto transform the nonlinear dynamical differential equations for the dynamic\nevolution of complex networks into linear systems for solving. Meanwhile, the\nphysical information neural differential equation method is utilised to ensure\nthat the dynamic evolution conforms to the physical laws. The dual-drive\ndynamic prediction module ensures both accuracy and interpretability of the\nprediction.

Rather than directly conditioning on\nthese noisy signals, CDE trains a policy to reconstruct the concepts via an\nauxiliary objective, using reconstruction accuracy as an intrinsic reward to\nguide exploration toward task-relevant objects. Because the policy internalizes\nthese concepts, VLM queries are only needed during training, reducing\ndependence on external models during deployment. Across five challenging\nsimulated visual manipulation tasks, CDE achieves efficient, targeted\nexploration and remains robust to noisy VLM predictions.

There are two main problems in the\ntask of predicting the dynamic evolution of complex networks: on the one hand,\nexisting methods usually use simple graphs to describe the relationships in\ncomplex networks; however, this approach can only capture pairwise\nrelationships, while there may be rich non-pairwise structured relationships in\nthe network. First-order GNNs have difficulty in capturing dynamic non-pairwise\nrelationships. On the other hand, theoretical prediction models lack accuracy\nand data-driven prediction models lack interpretability. To address the above\nproblems, this paper proposes a higher-order network dynamics identification\nmethod for long-term dynamic prediction of complex networks. Firstly, to\naddress the problem that traditional graph machine learning can only deal with\npairwise relations, dynamic hypergraph learning is introduced to capture the\nhigher-order non-pairwise relations among complex networks and improve the\naccuracy of complex network modelling. Then, a dual-driven dynamic prediction\nmodule for physical data is proposed. The Koopman operator theory is introduced\nto transform the nonlinear dynamical differential equations for the dynamic\nevolution of complex networks into linear systems for solving.

For retrieval, the system first extracts cue\nentities from queries, then performs a scalable multi-hop associative search\nacross the knowledge graph. Crucially, EcphoryRAG dynamically infers implicit\nrelations between entities to populate context, enabling deep reasoning without\nexhaustive pre-enumeration of relationships. Extensive evaluations on the\n2WikiMultiHop, HotpotQA, and MuSiQue benchmarks demonstrate that EcphoryRAG\nsets a new state-of-the-art, improving the average Exact Match (EM) score from\n0.392 to 0.474 over strong KG-RAG methods like HippoRAG.

Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated\nsignificant advancements across various domains including translation and\nsummarization, human consciousness is not something to imitate with current\nupfront technology owing to so-called hallucination. This study, therefore,\nproposes a novel approach to address these challenges by integrating\npsychoanalysis and the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) into constructing\nconsciousness and personality modules. We developed three artificial\nconsciousnesses (self-awareness, unconsciousness, and preconsciousness) based\non the principles of psychoanalysis. Additionally, we designed 16 characters\nwith different personalities representing the sixteen MBTI types, with several\nattributes such as needs, status, and memories. To determine if our model's\nartificial consciousness exhibits human-like cognition, we created ten distinct\nsituations considering seven attributes such as emotional understanding and\nlogical thinking. The decision-making process of artificial consciousness and\nthe final action were evaluated in three ways: survey evaluation, three-tier\nclassification via ChatGPT, and qualitative review. Both quantitative and\nqualitative analyses indicated a high likelihood of well-simulated\nconsciousness, although the difference in response between different characters\nand consciousnesses was not very significant. This implies that the developed\nmodels incorporating elements of psychoanalysis and personality theory can lead\nto building a more intuitive and adaptable AI system with humanoid\nconsciousness. Therefore, this study contributes to opening up new avenues for\nimproving AI interactions in complex cognitive contexts."}

We propose FIPER, a general\nframework for Failure Prediction at Runtime for generative IL policies that\ndoes not require failure data. FIPER identifies two key indicators of impending\nfailure: (i) out-of-distribution (OOD) observations detected via random network\ndistillation in the policy's embedding space, and (ii) high uncertainty in\ngenerated actions measured by a novel action-chunk entropy score.

This pursuit has\nrecently become vastly more practical with the emergence of large language\nmodels (LLMs) capable of using natural language to integrate information,\nfollow instructions, and perform forms of \"reasoning\" and planning across a\nwide range of tasks. With its multimodal data streams and orchestrated\nworkflows spanning multiple systems, radiology is uniquely suited to benefit\nfrom agents that can adapt to context and automate repetitive yet complex\ntasks. In radiology, LLMs and their multimodal variants have already\ndemonstrated promising performance for individual tasks such as information\nextraction and report summarization. However, using LLMs in isolation\nunderutilizes their potential to support complex, multi-step workflows where\ndecisions depend on evolving context from multiple information sources.\nEquipping LLMs with external tools and feedback mechanisms enables them to\ndrive systems that exhibit a spectrum of autonomy, ranging from semi-automated\nworkflows to more adaptive agents capable of managing complex processes. This\nreview examines the design of such LLM-driven agentic systems, highlights key\napplications, discusses evaluation methods for planning and tool use, and\noutlines challenges such as error cascades, tool-use efficiency, and health IT\nintegration."}

We developed three artificial\nconsciousnesses (self-awareness, unconsciousness, and preconsciousness) based\non the principles of psychoanalysis. Additionally, we designed 16 characters\nwith different personalities representing the sixteen MBTI types, with several\nattributes such as needs, status, and memories. To determine if our model's\nartificial consciousness exhibits human-like cognition, we created ten distinct\nsituations considering seven attributes such as emotional understanding and\nlogical thinking.

We propose FIPER, a general\nframework for Failure Prediction at Runtime for generative IL policies that\ndoes not require failure data. FIPER identifies two key indicators of impending\nfailure: (i) out-of-distribution (OOD) observations detected via random network\ndistillation in the policy's embedding space, and (ii) high uncertainty in\ngenerated actions measured by a novel action-chunk entropy score.

Jha"], "title": "GraphMERT: Efficient and Scalable Distillation of Reliable Knowledge Graphs from Unstructured Data", "comment": null, "summary": "Researchers have pursued neurosymbolic artificial intelligence (AI)\napplications for nearly three decades because symbolic components provide\nabstraction while neural components provide generalization. Thus, a marriage of\nthe two components can lead to rapid advancements in AI. Yet, the field has not\nrealized this promise since most neurosymbolic AI frameworks fail to scale. In\naddition, the implicit representations and approximate reasoning of neural\napproaches limit interpretability and trust. Knowledge graphs (KGs), a\ngold-standard representation of explicit semantic knowledge, can address the\nsymbolic side. However, automatically deriving reliable KGs from text corpora\nhas remained an open problem. We address these challenges by introducing\nGraphMERT, a tiny graphical encoder-only model that distills high-quality KGs\nfrom unstructured text corpora and its own internal representations. GraphMERT\nand its equivalent KG form a modular neurosymbolic stack: neural learning of\nabstractions; symbolic KGs for verifiable reasoning. GraphMERT + KG is the\nfirst efficient and scalable neurosymbolic model to achieve state-of-the-art\nbenchmark accuracy along with superior symbolic representations relative to\nbaselines.\n  Concretely, we target reliable domain-specific KGs that are both (1) factual\n(with provenance) and (2) valid (ontology-consistent relations with\ndomain-appropriate semantics). When a large language model (LLM), e.g.,\nQwen3-32B, generates domain-specific KGs, it falls short on reliability due to\nprompt sensitivity, shallow domain expertise, and hallucinated relations. On\ntext obtained from PubMed papers on diabetes, our 80M-parameter GraphMERT\nyields a KG with a 69.8% FActScore; a 32B-parameter baseline LLM yields a KG\nthat achieves only 40.2% FActScore. The GraphMERT KG also attains a higher\nValidityScore of 68.8%, versus 43.0% for the LLM baseline."}

This Resource paper provides (a) a\nsystematic review of the literature on Community Notes, and (b) a major curated\ndataset and accompanying source code to support future research on Community\nNotes. We parsed Notes and Ratings data from the first four years of the\nprogram and conducted language detection across all Notes.

Yet, current coding benchmarks face\nlimitations such as lack of exceptionally challenging problems, insufficient\ntest case coverage, reliance on online platform APIs that limit accessibility.\nTo address these issues, we introduce LiveOIBench, a comprehensive benchmark\nfeaturing 403 expert-curated Olympiad-level competitive programming problems,\neach with an average of 60 expert-designed test cases. The problems are sourced\ndirectly from 72 official Informatics Olympiads in different regions conducted\nbetween 2023 and 2025. LiveOIBench distinguishes itself through four key\nfeatures: (1) meticulously curated high-quality tasks with detailed subtask\nrubrics and extensive private test cases; (2) direct integration of elite\ncontestant performance data to enable informative comparison against\ntop-performing humans; (3) planned continuous, contamination-free updates from\nnewly released Olympiad problems; and (4) a self-contained evaluation system\nfacilitating offline and easy-to-reproduce assessments. Benchmarking 32 popular\ngeneral-purpose and reasoning LLMs, we find that GPT-5 achieves a notable\n81.76th percentile, a strong result that nonetheless falls short of top human\ncontestant performance, who usually place above 90th. In contrast, among\nopen-weight reasoning models, GPT-OSS-120B achieves only a 60th percentile,\nunderscoring significant capability disparities from frontier closed models.\nDetailed analyses indicate that robust reasoning models prioritize precise\nproblem analysis over excessive exploration, suggesting future models should\nemphasize structured analysis and minimize unnecessary exploration. All data,\ncode, and leaderboard results will be made publicly available on our website."}

However, they tend to face\nsignificant challenges in accessing credit due to limited financial histories,\ncollateral constraints, and exposure to macroeconomic shocks. These challenges\nmake an accurate credit risk assessment by lenders crucial, particularly since\nSMEs frequently operate within interconnected firm networks through which\ndefault risk can propagate. This paper presents and tests a novel approach for\nmodelling the risk of SME credit, using a unique large data set of SME loans\nprovided by a prominent financial institution. Specifically, our approach\nemploys Graph Neural Networks to predict SME default using multilayer network\ndata derived from common ownership and financial transactions between firms. We\nshow that combining this information with traditional structured data not only\nimproves application scoring performance, but also explicitly models contagion\nrisk between companies. Further analysis shows how the directionality and\nintensity of these connections influence financial risk contagion, offering a\ndeeper understanding of the underlying processes. Our findings highlight the\npredictive power of network data, as well as the role of supply chain networks\nin exposing SMEs to correlated default risk."}
