A Multi-Dimensional Textual and Structural Comparison", "comment": "13 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables", "summary": "The launch of Grokipedia, an AI-generated encyclopedia developed by Elon\nMusk's xAI, was presented as a response to perceived ideological and structural\nbiases in Wikipedia, aiming to produce \"truthful\" entries via the large\nlanguage model Grok. Yet whether an AI-driven alternative can escape the biases\nand limitations of human-edited platforms remains unclear. This study\nundertakes a large-scale computational comparison of 382 matched article pairs\nbetween Grokipedia and Wikipedia. Using metrics across lexical richness,\nreadability, structural organization, reference density, and semantic\nsimilarity, we assess how closely the two platforms align in form and\nsubstance. The results show that while Grokipedia exhibits strong semantic and\nstylistic alignment with Wikipedia, it typically produces longer but less\nlexically diverse articles, with fewer references per word and more variable\nstructural depth. These findings suggest that AI-generated encyclopedic content\ncurrently mirrors Wikipedia's informational scope but diverges in editorial\nnorms, favoring narrative expansion over citation-based verification. The\nimplications highlight new tensions around transparency, provenance, and the\ngovernance of knowledge in an era of automated text generation."}

As a byproduct of this goal, we also evaluate\nhow frequently the banners comply with GDPR and the recommendations of national\ndata protection authorities regarding banner designs. We visited 2,579 websites\nand identified the type of cookie banner implemented. Although 45% of the\nrelevant websites have fully compliant banners, we found aesthetic manipulation\non 38% of the compliant banners. Unlike prior studies of aesthetic\nmanipulation, we use a computer vision model for salient object detection to\nmeasure how salient (i.e., attention-drawing) each banner element is. This\nenables the discovery of new types of aesthetic manipulation (e.g., button\nplacement), and leads us to conclude that aesthetic manipulation is more common\nthan previously reported (38% vs 27% of banners). To study the effects of user\nand/or website location on cookie banner design, we include websites within the\nEuropean Union (EU), where privacy regulation enforcement is more stringent,\nand websites outside the EU. We visited websites from IP addresses in the EU\nand from IP addresses in the United States (US). We find that 13.9% of EU\nwebsites change their banner design when the user is from the US, and EU\nwebsites are roughly 48.3% more likely to use aesthetic manipulation than\nnon-EU websites, highlighting their innovative responses to privacy regulation."}

However, the algorithms used by search engines to index, filter, and rank\nweb content are inherently biased, and will necessarily prefer some views and\nopinions at the expense of others. In this article, we examine how these\nalgorithmic biases amplify and suppress polarizing content. Polarization refers\nto a shift toward and the acceptance of ideological extremes. In Europe,\npolarizing content in relation to LGBTIQ+ issues has been a feature of various\nideological and political conflicts. Although past research has focused on the\nrole of social media in polarization, the role of search engines in this\nprocess is little understood. Here, we report on a large-scale study of 1.5\nmillion search results responding to neutral and negative queries relating to\nLGBTIQ+ issues. Focusing on the UK, Germany, and France, our analysis shows\nthat the choice of search engine is the key determinant of exposure to\npolarizing content, followed by the polarity of the query. Location and\nlanguage, on the other hand, have a comparatively minor effect. Consequently,\nour findings provide quantitative insights into how differences between search\nengine technologies, rather than the opinions, language, and location of web\nusers, have the greatest impact on the exposure of web users to polarizing Web\ncontent."}

Unlike traditional\nsearch engines, whose retrieval and ranking mechanisms are well studied, the\nselection processes of web-connected LLMs add layers of opacity to how answers\nare generated. By determining which news outlets users see, these systems can\ninfluence public opinion, reinforce echo chambers, and pose risks to civic\ndiscourse and public trust.\n  This work extends two decades of research in algorithmic auditing to examine\nhow LLMs function as news engines. We present the first audit comparing three\nleading agents, GPT-4o-Mini, Claude-3.7-Sonnet, and Gemini-2.0-Flash, against\nGoogle News, asking: \\textit{How do LLMs differ from traditional aggregators in\nthe diversity, ideology, and reliability of the media they expose to users?}\n  Across 24 global topics, we find that, compared to Google News, LLMs surface\nsignificantly fewer unique outlets and allocate attention more unevenly. In the\nsame way, GPT-4o-Mini emphasizes more factual and right-leaning sources;\nClaude-3.7-Sonnet favors institutional and civil-society domains and slightly\namplifies right-leaning exposure; and Gemini-2.0-Flash exhibits a modest\nleft-leaning tilt without significant changes in factuality.

Our pipeline operationalizes an endpoint-driven,\nreductionist strategy: a Socratic agent, guided by a curriculum of around 200\ncourses, generates approximately 3 million first-principles questions. To\nensure high fidelity, multiple independent solver models generate LCoTs, which\nare then rigorously filtered by prompt sanitization and cross-model answer\nconsensus, retaining only those with verifiable endpoints. This verified corpus\npowers the Brainstorm Search Engine, which performs inverse knowledge search --\nretrieving diverse, first-principles derivations that culminate in a target\nconcept. This engine, in turn, feeds the Plato synthesizer, which narrates\nthese verified chains into coherent articles. The initial SciencePedia\ncomprises approximately 200,000 fine-grained entries spanning mathematics,\nphysics, chemistry, biology, engineering, and computation. In evaluations\nacross six disciplines, Plato-synthesized articles (conditioned on retrieved\nLCoTs) exhibit substantially higher knowledge-point density and significantly\nlower factual error rates than an equally-prompted baseline without retrieval\n(as judged by an external LLM). Built on this verifiable LCoT knowledge base,\nthis reasoning-centric approach enables trustworthy, cross-domain scientific\nsynthesis at scale and establishes the foundation for an ever-expanding\nencyclopedia."}

Our pipeline operationalizes an endpoint-driven,\nreductionist strategy: a Socratic agent, guided by a curriculum of around 200\ncourses, generates approximately 3 million first-principles questions. To\nensure high fidelity, multiple independent solver models generate LCoTs, which\nare then rigorously filtered by prompt sanitization and cross-model answer\nconsensus, retaining only those with verifiable endpoints. This verified corpus\npowers the Brainstorm Search Engine, which performs inverse knowledge search --\nretrieving diverse, first-principles derivations that culminate in a target\nconcept.

Empirical data on\nfollower counts and follower-count-based rankings reveal that the distribution\nof social power varies significantly across different types of platforms, with\ncontent-based platforms exhibiting notably greater inequality. Here we propose\ntwo fundamental network formation mechanisms: a meritocracy-based model and a\nMatthew-effect-based model, designed to capture the formation logic underlying\ntraditional and emerging social networks, respectively. Through theoretical and\nnumerical analysis, we demonstrate that both models replicate salient\nstatistical features of social networks including scale-free and small-world\nproperty, while also closely match empirical patterns on the relationship\nbetween in-degrees and in-degree rankings, thereby capturing the distinctive\ndistributions of social power in respective platforms.

Formal methods\nprovide provable guarantees but demand hand-crafted temporal-logic\nspecifications, offering limited expressiveness and accessibility. Deep\nlearning approaches enable evaluation of plans against natural-language\nconstraints, yet their opaque decision process invites misclassifications with\npotentially severe consequences. We introduce RepV, a neurosymbolic verifier\nthat unifies both views by learning a latent space where safe and unsafe plans\nare linearly separable. Starting from a modest seed set of plans labeled by an\noff-the-shelf model checker, RepV trains a lightweight projector that embeds\neach plan, together with a language model-generated rationale, into a\nlow-dimensional space; a frozen linear boundary then verifies compliance for\nunseen natural-language rules in a single forward pass.\n  Beyond binary classification, RepV provides a probabilistic guarantee on the\nlikelihood of correct verification based on its position in the latent space.\nThis guarantee enables a guarantee-driven refinement of the planner, improving\nrule compliance without human annotations. Empirical evaluations show that RepV\nimproves compliance prediction accuracy by up to 15% compared to baseline\nmethods while adding fewer than 0.2M parameters. Furthermore, our refinement\nframework outperforms ordinary fine-tuning baselines across various planning\ndomains.

To address these issues, we propose Adaptive\nEffort Control, a self-adaptive reinforcement learning method that trains\nmodels to use a user-specified fraction of tokens relative to the current\naverage chain-of-thought length for each query. This approach eliminates\ndataset- and phase-specific tuning while producing better cost-accuracy\ntradeoff curves compared to standard methods. Users can dynamically adjust the\ncost-accuracy trade-off through a continuous effort parameter specified at\ninference time. We observe that the model automatically learns to allocate\nresources proportionally to the task difficulty and, across model scales\nranging from 1.5B to 32B parameters, our approach enables approximately 3x\nreduction in chain-of-thought length while maintaining or improving performance\nrelative to the base model used for RL training."}

The methodology leveraged high resolution SSURGO dataset,\nexplicitly processing soil properties aggregated across the 0 to 30 cm root\nzone. Multivariate analysis incorporating a variational autoencoder and KMeans\nclustering was used to group soils with similar properties.

The Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) provides a\npowerful framework for planning under partial observability problems, capturing\nthe stochastic effects of actions and the limited information available through\nnoisy observations. POMDP solving could benefit tremendously from massive\nparallelization of today's hardware, but parallelizing POMDP solvers has been\nchallenging. They rely on interleaving numerical optimization over actions with\nthe estimation of their values, which creates dependencies and synchronization\nbottlenecks between parallel processes that can quickly offset the benefits of\nparallelization. In this paper, we propose Vectorized Online POMDP Planner\n(VOPP), a novel parallel online solver that leverages a recent POMDP\nformulation that analytically solves part of the optimization component,\nleaving only the estimation of expectations for numerical computation. VOPP\nrepresents all data structures related to planning as a collection of tensors\nand implements all planning steps as fully vectorized computations over this\nrepresentation.

Conventional\ngrippers often rely on applying high normal forces, which can cause damage to\nobjects. To address this limitation, we present a hybrid gripper finger that\ncombines a rigid structural shell with a soft, inflatable silicone pocket. The\ngripper finger can actively modulate its surface friction by controlling the\ninternal air pressure of the silicone pocket. Results from fundamental\nexperiments indicate that increasing the internal pressure results in a\nproportional increase in the effective coefficient of friction. This enables\nthe gripper to stably lift heavy and slippery objects without increasing the\ngripping force and to handle fragile or deformable objects, such as eggs,\nfruits, and paper cups, with minimal damage by increasing friction rather than\napplying excessive force. The experimental results demonstrate that the hybrid\ngripper finger with adaptable friction provides a robust and safer alternative\nto relying solely on high normal forces, thereby enhancing the gripper\nflexibility in handling delicate, fragile, and diverse objects."}

Quantitative scores and qualitative inquiries\nexpose convergence and disagreement within and across communities, illuminate\nthe downstream consequences of misrepresentation, and trace how training data\nshaped by unequal power relations distort depictions. Extensive assessments are\nconstrained by high resource requirements and the dynamic nature of culture, a\ntension we alleviate through a context-based and iterative methodology. The\npaper provides actionable recommendations for stakeholders, highlighting\npathways to investigate the sources, mechanisms, and impacts of cultural\n(mis)representation in T2I models."}

Existing\napproaches often rely on rule-based logic, game-theoretic models, or\n'black-box' machine learning methods. However, these models typically lack\nflexibility or overlook the underlying mechanisms, such as sensory and motor\nconstraints, which shape how pedestrians and drivers perceive and act in\ninteractive scenarios. In this study, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement\nlearning (RL) framework that integrates both visual and motor constraints of\npedestrian and driver agents. Using a real-world dataset from an unsignalised\npedestrian crossing, we evaluate four model variants, one without constraints,\ntwo with either motor or visual constraints, and one with both, across\nbehavioural metrics of interaction realism. Results show that the combined\nmodel with both visual and motor constraints performs best. Motor constraints\nlead to smoother movements that resemble human speed adjustments during\ncrossing interactions. The addition of visual constraints introduces perceptual\nuncertainty and field-of-view limitations, leading the agents to exhibit more\ncautious and variable behaviour, such as less abrupt deceleration. In this\ndata-limited setting, our model outperforms a supervised behavioural cloning\nmodel, demonstrating that our approach can be effective without large training\ndatasets. Finally, our framework accounts for individual differences by\nmodelling parameters controlling the human constraints as population-level\ndistributions, a perspective that has not been explored in previous work on\npedestrian-vehicle interaction modelling. Overall, our work demonstrates that\nmulti-agent RL with human constraints is a promising modelling approach for\nsimulating realistic road user interactions."}

However, such vision driven embodied agents open a new attack\nsurface: visual backdoor attacks, where the agent behaves normally until a\nvisual trigger appears in the scene, then persistently executes an\nattacker-specified multi-step policy. We introduce BEAT, the first framework to\ninject such visual backdoors into MLLM-based embodied agents using objects in\nthe environments as triggers. Unlike textual triggers, object triggers exhibit\nwide variation across viewpoints and lighting, making them difficult to implant\nreliably. BEAT addresses this challenge by (1) constructing a training set that\nspans diverse scenes, tasks, and trigger placements to expose agents to trigger\nvariability, and (2) introducing a two-stage training scheme that first applies\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT) and then our novel Contrastive Trigger Learning\n(CTL). CTL formulates trigger discrimination as preference learning between\ntrigger-present and trigger-free inputs, explicitly sharpening the decision\nboundaries to ensure precise backdoor activation. Across various embodied agent\nbenchmarks and MLLMs, BEAT achieves attack success rates up to 80%, while\nmaintaining strong benign task performance, and generalizes reliably to\nout-of-distribution trigger placements. Notably, compared to naive SFT, CTL\nboosts backdoor activation accuracy up to 39% under limited backdoor data.\nThese findings expose a critical yet unexplored security risk in MLLM-based\nembodied agents, underscoring the need for robust defenses before real-world\ndeployment."}

However, training them to succeed on long-horizon,\ndomain-specialized tasks remains challenging. Current methods primarily fall\ninto two categories. The first relies on dense human annotations through\nbehavior cloning, which is prohibitively expensive for long-horizon tasks that\ncan take days or months. The second depends on outcome-driven sampling, which\noften collapses due to the rarity of valid positive trajectories on\ndomain-specialized tasks. We introduce Apollo, a sampling framework that\nintegrates asynchronous human guidance with action-level data filtering.\nInstead of requiring annotators to shadow every step, Apollo allows them to\nintervene only when the agent drifts from a promising trajectory, by providing\nprior knowledge, strategic advice, etc. This lightweight design makes it\npossible to sustain interactions for over 30 hours and produces valuable\ntrajectories at a lower cost. Apollo then applies supervision control to filter\nout sub-optimal actions and prevent error propagation. Together, these\ncomponents enable reliable and effective data collection in long-horizon\nenvironments. To demonstrate the effectiveness of Apollo, we evaluate it using\nInnovatorBench. Our experiments show that when applied to train the GLM-4.5\nmodel on InnovatorBench, Apollo achieves more than a 50% improvement over the\nuntrained baseline and a 28% improvement over a variant trained without human\ninteraction.

Dissipativity is a fundamental system\nproperty that generalizes Lyapunov stability, passivity, and finite L2 gain\nconditions through an energy balance inequality between a storage function and\na supply rate. Unlike prior parametric formulations that approximate these\nfunctions using quadratic forms with fixed matrices, the proposed method\nrepresents them as Hilbert Schmidt operators acting on canonical kernel\nfeatures, thereby capturing nonlinearities implicitly while preserving\nconvexity and analytic tractability. The resulting operator optimization\nproblem is formulated in the form of a one-class support vector machine and\nreduced, via the representer theorem, to a finite dimensional convex program\nexpressed through kernel Gram matrices.
