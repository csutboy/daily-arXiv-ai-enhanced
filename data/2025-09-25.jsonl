In this paper, I propose\nquantitative measures of this distortion that can be applied to demographic\ngroups, using Census data, to assess and visualize these distortive effects.\nThese include the absolute weight of votes under these systems and the excess\npopulation represented in the bodies through the distortions. Visualizing these\nmetrics from 2000 -- 2020 shows persistent malapportionment in key demographic\ncategories.

Existing evaluation approaches frequently suffer\nfrom high variance due to limited data and long-horizon tasks, or high bias due\nto unequal support or inaccurate environmental models. We posit that these\nchallenges arise, in part, from the standard reinforcement learning (RL)\nparadigm of policy learning without explicit consideration of evaluation. As an\nalternative, we propose evaluation-aware reinforcement learning (EvA-RL), in\nwhich a policy is trained to maximize expected return while simultaneously\nminimizing expected evaluation error under a given value prediction scheme --\nin other words, being \"easy\" to evaluate. We formalize a framework for EvA-RL\nand design an instantiation that enables accurate policy evaluation,\nconditioned on a small number of rollouts in an assessment environment that can\nbe different than the deployment environment. However, our theoretical analysis\nand empirical results show that there is often a tradeoff between evaluation\naccuracy and policy performance when using a fixed value-prediction scheme\nwithin EvA-RL. To mitigate this tradeoff, we extend our approach to co-learn an\nassessment-conditioned state-value predictor alongside the policy. Empirical\nresults across diverse discrete and continuous action domains demonstrate that\nEvA-RL can substantially reduce evaluation error while maintaining competitive\nreturns. This work lays the foundation for a broad new class of RL methods that\ntreat reliable evaluation as a first-class principle during training."}

Inferring\nthe underlying network structure from such partial observations remains a\nfundamental challenge, particularly under nonlinear dynamics. We uncover a\nrobust linear relationship between the spectral strength of a node's behavioral\ntime series under evolutionary game dynamics and its structural degree, $S\n\\propto k$, a structural-behavioral scaling that holds across network types and\nscales, revealing a universal correspondence between local connectivity and\ndynamic energy. Leveraging this insight, we develop a deterministic,\nfrequency-domain inference framework based on the discrete Fourier transform\n(DFT) that reconstructs network topology directly from payoff sequences-without\nprior knowledge of the network or internal node strategies-by selectively\nperturbing node dynamics. The framework simultaneously localizes individual\nhidden nodes or identifies all edges connected to multiple hidden nodes, and\nestimates tight bounds on the number of hidden nodes. Extensive experiments on\nsynthetic and real-world networks demonstrate that our method consistently\noutperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both topology reconstruction and\nhidden component detection.

The incorporation of\nparallel connectivity between modules equips systems with advantages such as\nsensorless balancing, switched-capacitor energy exchange, and reduced\nimpedance. However, existing topologies require many individual switches --\neight transistors per module. Efforts to use fewer switches, instead, have\npreviously compromised their functionality. We propose a new module topology,\nnamed the direction-selective parallel (DiSeP) structure, which requires only\nfour transistors per module -- the same as an H bridge -- but can achieve\nbidirectional equilibration, bipolar module output, and inter-module\nswitched-capacitor features.\n  This topology is highly attractive for existing converters with cascaded\nbridge elements, as the addition of only four diodes enables key features such\nas sensorless balancing and inter-module energy exchange. Thus, the module can\noutcompete H bridges in their applications, as it adds parallel modes without\nany additional transistors.

To\nenhance the diversity of these demonstrations, SEIL employs dual-level\naugmentation: (i) Model-level, using an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) model\nto collaborate with the primary model, and (ii) Environment-level, introducing\nslight variations in initial object positions. We further introduce a\nlightweight selector that filters complementary and informative trajectories\nfrom the generated pool to ensure demonstration quality. These curated samples\nenable the model to achieve competitive performance with far fewer training\nexamples. Extensive experiments on the LIBERO benchmark show that SEIL achieves\na new state-of-the-art performance in few-shot imitation learning scenarios.\nCode is available at https://github.com/Jasper-aaa/SEIL.git."}

The incorporation of\nparallel connectivity between modules equips systems with advantages such as\nsensorless balancing, switched-capacitor energy exchange, and reduced\nimpedance. However, existing topologies require many individual switches --\neight transistors per module. Efforts to use fewer switches, instead, have\npreviously compromised their functionality. We propose a new module topology,\nnamed the direction-selective parallel (DiSeP) structure, which requires only\nfour transistors per module -- the same as an H bridge -- but can achieve\nbidirectional equilibration, bipolar module output, and inter-module\nswitched-capacitor features.\n  This topology is highly attractive for existing converters with cascaded\nbridge elements, as the addition of only four diodes enables key features such\nas sensorless balancing and inter-module energy exchange. Thus, the module can\noutcompete H bridges in their applications, as it adds parallel modes without\nany additional transistors. Compared to double-H bridges (CH2B), it saves as\nmany as half of the transistors.\n  We elaborate on its working principles and key design considerations. We\nvalidate our theories on an experimental prototype with six modules. This\nprototype attains a total voltage harmonic distortion plus noise (THD+N) of\n10.3% and a peak efficiency of 96.3%. Furthermore, the modules achieve\nautonomous sensorless balancing under open-loop control."}

In this work, we present a training framework for robotic\nfoundation models that enables omni-modal goal conditioning for vision-based\nnavigation. Our approach leverages a high-capacity vision-language-action (VLA)\nbackbone and trains with three primary goal modalities: 2D poses, egocentric\nimages, and natural language, as well as their combinations, through a\nrandomized modality fusion strategy. This design not only expands the pool of\nusable datasets but also encourages the policy to develop richer geometric,\nsemantic, and visual representations. The resulting model, OmniVLA, achieves\nstrong generalization to unseen environments, robustness to scarce modalities,\nand the ability to follow novel natural language instructions.

As an\nalternative, we propose evaluation-aware reinforcement learning (EvA-RL), in\nwhich a policy is trained to maximize expected return while simultaneously\nminimizing expected evaluation error under a given value prediction scheme --\nin other words, being \"easy\" to evaluate. We formalize a framework for EvA-RL\nand design an instantiation that enables accurate policy evaluation,\nconditioned on a small number of rollouts in an assessment environment that can\nbe different than the deployment environment.

The nonlinear\nresponses of soft actuators under dynamic loading conditions limit the use of\nanalytic models for soft robot control.

Agents can become trapped in unforeseen loops, generate inaccurate\noutputs, or encounter unrecoverable failures, leading to user frustration and a\nbreakdown of trust. This report proposes a novel architectural pattern to\naddress these issues: the integration of a secondary, \"metacognitive\" layer\nthat actively monitors the primary LCNC agent. Inspired by human introspection,\nthis layer is designed to predict impending task failures based on a defined\nset of triggers, such as excessive latency or repetitive actions. Upon\npredicting a failure, the metacognitive agent proactively initiates a human\nhandoff, providing the user with a clear summary of the agent's \"thought\nprocess\" and a detailed explanation of why it could not proceed. An empirical\nanalysis of a prototype system demonstrates that this approach significantly\nincreases the overall task success rate. However, this performance gain comes\nwith a notable increase in computational overhead. The findings reframe human\nhandoffs not as an admission of defeat but as a core design feature that\nenhances system resilience, improves user experience, and builds trust by\nproviding transparency into the agent's internal state.

Our approach\nbegins by fine-tuning an LLM on rationalized datasets containing both\nreasoning-enhanced refusal responses to adversarial prompts and\nreasoning-enhanced normal responses to benign queries, establishing robust\nbehavioral priors across both safety-critical and utility-preserving scenarios.\nWe then train a structured variational autoencoder (VAE) on intermediate MLP\nactivations, supervised by multi-label annotations including attack types,\nattack methods, and benign indicators. This supervision enables the VAE to\nlearn disentangled latent representations that capture distinct adversarial\ncharacteristics while maintaining semantic interpretability. Through targeted\nmanipulation of learned latent dimensions, LATENTGUARD achieves selective\nrefusal behavior, effectively blocking harmful requests while preserving\nhelpfulness for legitimate use cases. Experiments on Qwen3-8B demonstrate\nsignificant improvements in both safety controllability and response\ninterpretability without compromising utility.

Classical control methods offer valuable insight into how such systems\ncan stabilize themselves, but synthesizing real-time controllers for nonlinear\nand hybrid dynamics remains challenging. Recently, reinforcement learning (RL)\nhas gained popularity for locomotion control due to its ability to handle these\ncomplex dynamics.

As such, this paper\ncomprehensively explores the literature in embodied AI from basics to advances,\ncovering both LLM driven and WM driven works. In particular, we first present\nthe history, key technologies, key components, and hardware systems of embodied\nAI, as well as discuss its development via looking from unimodal to multimodal\nangle. We then scrutinize the two burgeoning fields of embodied AI, i.e.,\nembodied AI with LLMs/multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) and embodied AI with WMs,\nmeticulously delineating their indispensable roles in end-to-end embodied\ncognition and physical laws-driven embodied interactions. Building upon the\nabove advances, we further share our insights on the necessity of the joint\nMLLM-WM driven embodied AI architecture, shedding light on its profound\nsignificance in enabling complex tasks within physical worlds. In addition, we\nexamine representative applications of embodied AI, demonstrating its wide\napplicability in real-world scenarios. Last but not least, we point out future\nresearch directions of embodied AI that deserve further investigation."}

While models excel at isolated tasks, the\ncomputational limits that govern their reasoning under cognitive load remain\npoorly understood. In this work, we introduce a formal theory of computational\ncognitive load, positing that extraneous, task-irrelevant information (Context\nSaturation) and interference from task-switching (Attentional Residue) are key\nmechanisms that degrade performance. We designed the Interleaved Cognitive\nEvaluation (ICE), a deconfounded benchmark to systematically manipulate these\nload factors on challenging multi-hop reasoning tasks. A comprehensive study (N\n= 10 replications per item across 200 questions) revealed significant\nperformance variations across five instruction-tuned models. Smaller\nopen-source architectures (Llama-3-8B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2)\nexhibited baseline brittleness, achieving 0% accuracy (SEM = 0.0) across all\nconditions, including clean controls, on this high-intrinsic-load task. In\ncontrast, Gemini-2.0-Flash-001 showed partial resilience, achieving 85%\naccuracy in control conditions, with a statistically significant degradation\nunder context saturation ($\\beta = -0.003$ per % load, $p < 0.001$). These\nfindings provide preliminary evidence that cognitive load is a key contributor\nto reasoning failures, supporting theories of hallucination-as-guessing under\nuncertainty. We conclude that dynamic, cognitive-aware stress testing, as\nexemplified by the ICE benchmark, is essential for evaluating the true\nresilience and safety of advanced AI systems."}

Undirected graphs enforce symmetry in\ninformation exchange, leading to convergence to the average of initial states,\nwhile directed graphs permit asymmetry but make consensus dependent on root\nnodes and their influence. Both paradigms impose inherent restrictions on\nachievable consensus values and network robustness. This paper introduces a\ntheoretical framework for achieving consensus over a class of network\ntopologies, termed pseudo-undirected graphs, which retains bidirectional\nconnectivity between node pairs but allows the corresponding edge weights to\ndiffer, including the possibility of negative values under bounded conditions.\nThe resulting Laplacian is generally non-symmetric, yet it guarantees consensus\nunder connectivity assumptions, to expand the solution space, which enables the\nsystem to achieve a stable consensus value that can lie outside the convex hull\nof the initial state set. We derive admissibility bounds for negative weights\nfor a pseudo-undirected path graph, and show an application in the simultaneous\ninterception of a moving target."}

Existing methods that\ncompute motion under perception constraints fail to account for obstacles, are\ndesigned for low-DoF robots, or rely on simplified models of perception.\nFurthermore, in dynamic real-world environments, robots must replan and react\nquickly to changes and directly evaluating the quality of perception (e.g.,\nobject detection confidence) is often expensive or infeasible at runtime. This\nproblem is especially important in human-centered environments such as homes\nand hospitals, where effective perception is essential for safe and reliable\noperation. To address these challenges, we propose a GPU-parallelized\nperception-score-guided probabilistic roadmap planner with a neural surrogate\nmodel (PS-PRM).

Rather\nthan proposing new benchmarks or APIs, our contribution is to outline design\nprinciples for a scalable, community-driven open-source project. In StepEval,\nthe primary artifact for policy evaluation is the per-subgoal SR vector;\nhowever, other quantities (e.g., latency or cost estimates) are also considered\nfor framework-optimization diagnostics to help the community tune evaluation\nefficiency and accuracy when ground-truth subgoal success labels are available.\nWe discuss how such a framework can remain model-agnostic, support single- or\nmulti-view inputs, and be lightweight enough to adopt across labs. The intended\ncontribution is a shared direction: a minimal, extensible seed that invites\nopen-source contributions, so that scoring the steps, not just the final goal,\nbecomes a standard and reproducible practice."}

Open-Vocabulary Semantic Exploration in Real-World Semi-Static Environments", "comment": null, "summary": "Robots deployed in real-world environments, such as homes, must not only\nnavigate safely but also understand their surroundings and adapt to environment\nchanges. To perform tasks efficiently, they must build and maintain a semantic\nmap that accurately reflects the current state of the environment. Existing\nresearch on semantic exploration largely focuses on static scenes without\npersistent object-level instance tracking. A consistent map is, however,\ncrucial for real-world robotic applications where objects in the environment\ncan be removed, reintroduced, or shifted over time. In this work, to close this\ngap, we propose an open-vocabulary, semantic exploration system for semi-static\nenvironments. Our system maintains a consistent map by building a probabilistic\nmodel of object instance stationarity, systematically tracking semi-static\nchanges, and actively exploring areas that have not been visited for a\nprolonged period of time. In addition to active map maintenance, our approach\nleverages the map's semantic richness with LLM-based reasoning for\nopen-vocabulary object-goal navigation. This enables the robot to search more\nefficiently by prioritizing contextually relevant areas. We evaluate our\napproach across multiple real-world semi-static environments. Our system\ndetects 95% of map changes on average, improving efficiency by more than 29% as\ncompared to random and patrol baselines. Overall, our approach achieves a\nmapping precision within 2% of a fully rebuilt map while requiring\nsubstantially less exploration and further completes object goal navigation\ntasks about 14% faster than the next-best tested strategy (coverage\npatrolling).

In particular, we first present\nthe history, key technologies, key components, and hardware systems of embodied\nAI, as well as discuss its development via looking from unimodal to multimodal\nangle. We then scrutinize the two burgeoning fields of embodied AI, i.e.,\nembodied AI with LLMs/multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) and embodied AI with WMs,\nmeticulously delineating their indispensable roles in end-to-end embodied\ncognition and physical laws-driven embodied interactions. Building upon the\nabove advances, we further share our insights on the necessity of the joint\nMLLM-WM driven embodied AI architecture, shedding light on its profound\nsignificance in enabling complex tasks within physical worlds. In addition, we\nexamine representative applications of embodied AI, demonstrating its wide\napplicability in real-world scenarios.

Meanwhile, existing\nperception-based controllers still present several practical limitations,\nincluding a complex multi-sensor deployment system and expensive computing\nresource requirements. This paper proposes a DRL controller named MAstering\nRisky Gap Terrains (MARG), which integrates terrain maps and proprioception to\ndynamically adjust the action and enhance the robot's stability in these tasks.\nDuring the training phase, our controller accelerates policy optimization by\nselectively incorporating privileged information (e.g., center of mass,\nfriction coefficients) that are available in simulation but unmeasurable\ndirectly in real-world deployments due to sensor limitations.

Due to its nature, it is considered a GPS-denied\nenvironment, with extensive multipath effects and stringent operational\nconstraints that collectively create a uniquely challenging environment. This\npersistent gap highlights the need for domain-specific comparative studies,\nincluding rigorous cost, accuracy, and integration assessments, to inform a\nreliable and scalable deployment of a localisation system in the Smart Hangar.\nThis paper presents the first techno-economic roadmap that benchmarks motion\ncapture (MoCap), ultra-wideband (UWB), and a ceiling-mounted camera network\nacross three operational scenarios: robot localisation, asset tracking, and\nsurface defect detection within a 40x50 m hangar bay. A dual-layer optimisation\nfor camera selection and positioning framework is introduced, which couples\nmarket-based camera-lens selection with an optimisation solver, producing\ncamera layouts that minimise hardware while meeting accuracy targets. The\nroadmap equips MRO planners with an actionable method to balance accuracy,\ncoverage, and budget, demonstrating that an optimised vision architecture has\nthe potential to unlock robust and cost-effective sensing for next-generation\nSmart Hangars."}

In this work, we bring these avenues\ntogether in a unified framework: PAD (Parse-AugmentDistill), for learning\ngeneralizable bimanual policies from a single human video. Our method relies on\nthree steps: (a) parsing a human video demo into a robot-executable\nkeypoint-action trajectory, (b) employing bimanual task-and-motion-planning to\naugment the demonstration at scale without simulators, and (c) distilling the\naugmented trajectories into a keypoint-conditioned policy.

Hence, the successful adoption of UAM systems\nhinges on the ability to predict generated noise levels, and further develop\nmotion planning strategies that comply with community-level noise regulations\nwhile maintaining operational efficiency. To this end, this paper proposes a\nnovel noise-aware motion planning framework for UAM systems that ensures\ncompliance with noise regulations. We first develop a certifiable neural\nnetwork model to accurately predict eVTOL noise propagation patterns in urban\nenvironments, providing provable bounds on its correctness. To achieve a\ndesired level of accuracy, we propose an active sampling strategy to\nefficiently build the dataset used to train and test the noise model.

This paper introduces a\ntheoretical framework for achieving consensus over a class of network\ntopologies, termed pseudo-undirected graphs, which retains bidirectional\nconnectivity between node pairs but allows the corresponding edge weights to\ndiffer, including the possibility of negative values under bounded conditions.\nThe resulting Laplacian is generally non-symmetric, yet it guarantees consensus\nunder connectivity assumptions, to expand the solution space, which enables the\nsystem to achieve a stable consensus value that can lie outside the convex hull\nof the initial state set.
