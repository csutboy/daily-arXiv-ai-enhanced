In this study, we present one of the first in-depth analyses of how these realistic synthetic media shape the political landscape online, focusing specifically on the 2025 Canadian federal election. By analyzing 187,778 posts from X, Bluesky, and Reddit with a high-accuracy detection framework trained on a diverse set of modern generative models, we find that 5.86% of election-related images were deepfakes. Right-leaning accounts shared them more frequently, with 8.66% of their posted images flagged compared to 4.42% for left-leaning users, often with defamatory or conspiratorial intent. Yet, most detected deepfakes were benign or non-political, and harmful ones drew little attention, accounting for only 0.12% of all views on X. Overall, deepfakes were present in the election conversation, but their reach was modest, and realistic fabricated images, although less common, drew higher engagement, highlighting growing concerns about their potential misuse.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e862025\u5e74\u52a0\u62ff\u5927\u8054\u90a6\u9009\u4e3e\u671f\u95f4\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u4e0a\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f2a\u9020\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u53d1\u73b05.86%\u7684\u9009\u4e3e\u76f8\u5173\u56fe\u7247\u662f\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f2a\u9020\uff0c\u53f3\u503e\u8d26\u6237\u5206\u4eab\u66f4\u591a\uff0c\u4f46\u6709\u5bb3\u5185\u5bb9\u5f71\u54cd\u6709\u9650\u3002", "motivation": "AI\u751f\u6210\u7684\u653f\u6cbb\u5185\u5bb9\u65e5\u76ca\u5f15\u53d1\u62c5\u5fe7\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5173\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f2a\u9020\u5728\u6c11\u4e3b\u56fd\u5bb6\u91cd\u5927\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4e2d\u5b9e\u9645\u51fa\u73b0\u548c\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e86\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5408\u6210\u5a92\u4f53\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u5728\u7ebf\u653f\u6cbb\u683c\u5c40\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790X\u3001Bluesky\u548cReddit\u4e0a\u7684187,778\u4e2a\u5e16\u5b50\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u6837\u5316\u73b0\u4ee3\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\u8bc6\u522b\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f2a\u9020\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce82025\u5e74\u52a0\u62ff\u5927\u8054\u90a6\u9009\u4e3e\u3002", "result": "5.86%\u7684\u9009\u4e3e\u76f8\u5173\u56fe\u7247\u662f\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f2a\u9020\uff1b\u53f3\u503e\u8d26\u6237\u5206\u4eab\u66f4\u591a\uff088.66% vs \u5de6\u503e4.42%\uff09\uff0c\u5e38\u5e26\u6709\u8bfd\u8c24\u6216\u9634\u8c0b\u8bba\u610f\u56fe\uff1b\u4f46\u5927\u591a\u6570\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f2a\u9020\u662f\u826f\u6027\u6216\u975e\u653f\u6cbb\u7684\uff0c\u6709\u5bb3\u5185\u5bb9\u4ec5\u5360X\u5e73\u53f0\u603b\u6d4f\u89c8\u91cf\u76840.12%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f2a\u9020\u786e\u5b9e\u5b58\u5728\u4e8e\u9009\u4e3e\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f46\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u6709\u9650\uff1b\u903c\u771f\u7684\u4f2a\u9020\u56fe\u7247\u867d\u7136\u8f83\u5c11\u89c1\u4f46\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u9ad8\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\uff0c\u7a81\u663e\u4e86\u5bf9\u5176\u6f5c\u5728\u6ee5\u7528\u7684\u65e5\u76ca\u62c5\u5fe7\u3002"}}

This paper presents a large-scale, data-driven analysis of 40k political ads published on Facebook and Instagram in Switzerland between 2021 and 2025. Despite a voting population of only 5.6 million, the ad campaigns were significant in scale, costing CHF 4.5 million and achieving 560 million impressions. This study shows that political ads are used not only for federal elections, but also to influence referenda, where greater exposure to ``pro-Yes'' advertising correlates significantly with approval outcomes. The analysis of microtargeting reveals distinct partisan strategies: centrist and right-wing parties predominantly target older men, whereas left-wing parties focus on young women. Furthermore, significant region-specific demographic variations are observed even within the same party, reflecting Switzerland's strong territorial divisions. Regarding content, a clear pattern of ``talking past each other'' is identified: in line with issue ownership theory, parties avoid direct debate on shared issues, preferring to promote exclusively owned topics. Finally, it is demonstrated that these strategies are so distinct that an ad's author can be predicted using a machine learning model trained exclusively on its audience and topic features. This study sheds light on how microtargeting and issue divergence on social platforms may fragment the public sphere and bypass traditional democratic deliberation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u745e\u58eb\u76f4\u63a5\u6c11\u4e3b\u4f53\u5236\u4e0b\uff0c\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u653f\u6cbb\u5e7f\u544a\u5728\u9009\u4e3e\u548c\u516c\u6295\u4e2d\u53d1\u6325\u91cd\u8981\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5e7f\u544a\u66dd\u5149\u4e0e\u516c\u6295\u7ed3\u679c\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u515a\u6d3e\u91c7\u7528\u5dee\u5f02\u5316\u5fae\u76ee\u6807\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5185\u5bb9\u5448\u73b0\"\u5404\u8bf4\u5404\u8bdd\"\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u9884\u6d4b\u5e7f\u544a\u53d1\u5e03\u8005\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u745e\u58eb\u76f4\u63a5\u6c11\u4e3b\u4f53\u5236\u4e0b\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u653f\u6cbb\u5e7f\u544a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9891\u7e41\u516c\u6295\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u5fae\u76ee\u6807\u5e7f\u544a\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u6c11\u4e3b\u8fdb\u7a0b\u548c\u516c\u5171\u9886\u57df\u3002", "method": "\u5bf92021-2025\u5e74\u95f4\u745e\u58ebFacebook\u548cInstagram\u4e0a\u76844\u4e07\u6761\u653f\u6cbb\u5e7f\u544a\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5e7f\u544a\u652f\u51fa\u3001\u66dd\u5149\u91cf\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u53d7\u4f17\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u5e7f\u544a\u53d1\u5e03\u8005\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a1) \u653f\u6cbb\u5e7f\u544a\u4e0d\u4ec5\u7528\u4e8e\u9009\u4e3e\uff0c\u4e5f\u5f71\u54cd\u516c\u6295\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\"\u8d5e\u6210\"\u5e7f\u544a\u66dd\u5149\u4e0e\u516c\u6295\u901a\u8fc7\u7387\u663e\u8457\u76f8\u5173\uff1b2) \u515a\u6d3e\u5fae\u76ee\u6807\u7b56\u7565\u5dee\u5f02\u660e\u663e\uff1a\u4e2d\u53f3\u7ffc\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u8001\u5e74\u7537\u6027\uff0c\u5de6\u7ffc\u9488\u5bf9\u5e74\u8f7b\u5973\u6027\uff1b3) \u540c\u4e00\u515a\u6d3e\u5185\u90e8\u5b58\u5728\u5730\u533a\u6027\u4eba\u53e3\u5dee\u5f02\uff1b4) \u5185\u5bb9\u4e0a\u5448\u73b0\"\u5404\u8bf4\u5404\u8bdd\"\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u515a\u6d3e\u56de\u907f\u5171\u540c\u8bae\u9898\u8fa9\u8bba\uff1b5) \u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u57fa\u4e8e\u53d7\u4f17\u548c\u4e3b\u9898\u7279\u5f81\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u5e7f\u544a\u53d1\u5e03\u8005\u3002", "conclusion": "\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u4e0a\u7684\u5fae\u76ee\u6807\u5e7f\u544a\u548c\u8bae\u9898\u5206\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u80fd\u5206\u88c2\u516c\u5171\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u7ed5\u8fc7\u4f20\u7edf\u6c11\u4e3b\u5ba1\u8bae\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5bf9\u76f4\u63a5\u6c11\u4e3b\u4f53\u5236\u6784\u6210\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

The probability that a replication study yields an effect with the same sign, or the same statistical significance as an original study depends on the sum of the variances of the effect estimates. On this basis, when P equals 0.025 one-sided and the replication study has the same sample size and variance as the original study, the probability of achieving a one-sided P is less than or equal to 0.025 a second time is only about 0.283, consistent with currently observed modest replication rates. A higher replication probability would require a larger sample size than that derived from current single variance power calculations. However, if the replication study is based on an infinitely large sample size and thus has negligible variance then the probability that its estimated mean is same sign is 1 - P = 0.975. The reasoning is made clearer by changing continuous distributions to discretised scales and probability masses, thus avoiding ambiguity and improper flat priors.

Using a large-scale corpus spanning the pre- and post-LLM era, we observe patterns suggestive of a \"Dual-Track Evolution\": thematic convergence around AI-related topics, coupled with structured stylistic differentiation. Our analysis reveals three emergent adaptation patterns: authors showing increased similarity to AI style, those exhibiting decreased similarity, and those maintaining stylistic stability while engaging with AI-related themes.

While straightforward, this approach is computationally intensive and can yield conservative intervals due to discretization. We propose a novel method that exploits the algebraic structure of a broad class of test statistics--including those with variance estimators dependent on the null hypothesis--to produce exact confidence intervals efficiently. By expressing randomization statistics as rational functions of the parameter of interest, we analytically identify critical values where the test statistic's rank changes relative to the randomization distribution. This characterization allows us to derive the exact p-value curve and construct precise confidence intervals without exhaustive computation. For cases where the parameter of interest is a vector and a confidence region is needed, our method extends by calculating and storing the coefficients of the polynomial functions involved. This approach enables us to compute approximate p-value functions and confidence regions more efficiently than traditional grid search methods, as we avoid recalculating test statistics from scratch for each parameter value. We illustrate our method using tests from Pouliot (2024) and extend it to other randomization tests, such as those developed by DiCiccio and Romano (2017) and D'Haultf\u0153uille and Tuvaandorj (2024).

First, we compare three methods to reconstruct daily maximum temperature at the municipality level: 1. a Bayesian quantile regression model with spatial interpolation, 2. a Bayesian Gaussian regression model, 3. the gridded reanalysis data from ERA5-Land. Both Bayesian models are station-based and exhibit higher and more spatially variable temperatures compared to ERA5-Land. Then, using individual mortality data for cardiovascular and respiratory causes, we estimate temperature-mortality associations through Bayesian conditional Poisson models in a case-crossover design. Exposure is defined as the mean maximum temperature over the previous three days. Additional models include heatwave definitions combining different thresholds and durations. All models exhibit a marked increase in relative risk at high temperatures; however, the temperature of minimum risk varies significantly across methods. Stratified analyses reveal higher relative risk increases in females and the elderly (80+). Heatwave effects depend on the definitions used, but all methods capture an increased mortality risk associated with prolonged heat exposure. Results confirm the importance of temperature model choice in epidemiology and provide insights for early warning systems and climate-health adaptation strategies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e09\u79cd\u6e29\u5ea6\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u610f\u5927\u5229\u62c9\u9f50\u5965\u5730\u533a\u70ed\u76f8\u5173\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7387\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bfc\u81f4\u6700\u4f4e\u98ce\u9669\u6e29\u5ea6\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u90fd\u663e\u793a\u9ad8\u6e29\u4e0b\u76f8\u5bf9\u98ce\u9669\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u7a7a\u6e29\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u70ed\u76f8\u5173\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7387\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u4e3a\u6d41\u884c\u75c5\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u6c14\u5019\u5065\u5eb7\u9002\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u4f9b\u53c2\u8003", "method": "1. \u6bd4\u8f83\u4e09\u79cd\u65e5\u6700\u9ad8\u6e29\u5ea6\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u56de\u5f52+\u7a7a\u95f4\u63d2\u503c\u3001\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u9ad8\u65af\u56de\u5f52\u3001ERA5-Land\u518d\u5206\u6790\u6570\u636e\uff1b2. \u4f7f\u7528\u4e2a\u4f53\u5fc3\u8840\u7ba1\u548c\u547c\u5438\u7cfb\u7edf\u6b7b\u4ea1\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6761\u4ef6\u6cca\u677e\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u75c5\u4f8b\u4ea4\u53c9\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u4f30\u8ba1\u6e29\u5ea6-\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7387\u5173\u8054\uff1b3. \u989d\u5916\u6a21\u578b\u5305\u62ec\u4e0d\u540c\u9608\u503c\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u70ed\u6d6a\u5b9a\u4e49", "result": "\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6a21\u578b\u6bd4ERA5-Land\u663e\u793a\u66f4\u9ad8\u4e14\u7a7a\u95f4\u53d8\u5f02\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u6e29\u5ea6\uff1b\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u90fd\u663e\u793a\u9ad8\u6e29\u4e0b\u76f8\u5bf9\u98ce\u9669\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u4f46\u6700\u4f4e\u98ce\u9669\u6e29\u5ea6\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u6cd5\u95f4\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\uff1b\u5206\u5c42\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u5973\u6027\u548c80\u5c81\u4ee5\u4e0a\u8001\u5e74\u4eba\u76f8\u5bf9\u98ce\u9669\u589e\u52a0\u66f4\u9ad8\uff1b\u70ed\u6d6a\u6548\u5e94\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u4f46\u6240\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u90fd\u6355\u6349\u5230\u957f\u671f\u70ed\u66b4\u9732\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7387\u98ce\u9669\u589e\u52a0", "conclusion": "\u6e29\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u6d41\u884c\u75c5\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u65e9\u671f\u9884\u8b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u6c14\u5019\u5065\u5eb7\u9002\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u89c1\u89e3"}}

Conventional fairness interventions--affirmative action, categorical quotas, and proxy-based targeting--often rely on coarse indicators (e.g., race or region), operate within fixed quotas that induce zero-sum trade-offs, and lack transparent decision rules. This paper introduces the Adaptive Merit Framework (AMF), a policy-engineered mechanism that recognizes latent potential while preserving merit-based thresholds. AMF integrates three components: (1) a merit-anchored architecture in which conditional admits must exceed the same threshold as regular admits, (2) a dynamic threshold anchored to the raw score of the last regular admit, and (3) direct, continuous SES measurement verified through administrative data.\n  Empirical validation using the full PISA 2022 Korea dataset (N=6,377) shows that AMF identifies 4, 6, and 9 additional admits under alpha = 5, 10, and 15 respectively (0.06-0.14% of cohort). Population-weighted estimates using OECD sampling weights suggest that the real-world scale of conditional admits is modestly larger than the raw sample counts, yielding approximately 491, 603, and 760 additional admits under alpha = 5, 10, and 15. All conditional admits exceed the merit threshold by 0.16 to 6.14 points, indicating that AMF recognizes suppressed performance rather than relaxing standards.\n  Beyond SES-based corrections, AMF provides a design template for unified admissions architectures that replace fragmented equity tracks and support multi-dimensional evaluation frameworks.", "AI": {"tldr": "AMF\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u62db\u751f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u9608\u503c\u8bc6\u522b\u793e\u4f1a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5730\u4f4d\u8f83\u4f4e\u5b66\u751f\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5b66\u672f\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u589e\u52a0\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u516c\u5e73\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\uff08\u5982\u5e73\u6743\u884c\u52a8\u3001\u914d\u989d\u5236\uff09\u4f9d\u8d56\u7c97\u7cd9\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u96f6\u548c\u535a\u5f08\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u900f\u660e\u51b3\u7b56\u89c4\u5219\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u80fd\u8bc6\u522b\u6f5c\u5728\u80fd\u529b\u53c8\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u5b66\u672f\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u62db\u751f\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "AMF\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a1\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u6210\u7ee9\u7684\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u6761\u4ef6\u5f55\u53d6\u751f\u5fc5\u987b\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u5e38\u89c4\u5f55\u53d6\u751f\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u9608\u503c\uff1b2\uff09\u4ee5\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u540d\u5e38\u89c4\u5f55\u53d6\u751f\u539f\u59cb\u5206\u6570\u4e3a\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u9608\u503c\uff1b3\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u884c\u653f\u6570\u636e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u3001\u8fde\u7eed\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5730\u4f4d\u6d4b\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u4f7f\u7528PISA 2022\u97e9\u56fd\u6570\u636e\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0cAMF\u5728\u03b1=5,10,15\u65f6\u5206\u522b\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa4\u30016\u30019\u540d\u989d\u5916\u5f55\u53d6\u751f\uff08\u5360\u961f\u52170.06-0.14%\uff09\u3002\u52a0\u6743\u4f30\u8ba1\u663e\u793a\u5b9e\u9645\u89c4\u6a21\u66f4\u5927\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u4e3a491\u3001603\u3001760\u540d\u989d\u5916\u5f55\u53d6\u751f\u3002\u6240\u6709\u6761\u4ef6\u5f55\u53d6\u751f\u90fd\u8d85\u8fc7\u6210\u7ee9\u9608\u503c0.16-6.14\u5206\u3002", "conclusion": "AMF\u4e0d\u4ec5\u89e3\u51b3\u793e\u4f1a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5730\u4f4d\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fd8\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00\u62db\u751f\u67b6\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6a21\u677f\uff0c\u66ff\u4ee3\u788e\u7247\u5316\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u8f68\u9053\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u7ef4\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

We model endogenous treatment selection as an equilibrium outcome that explicitly accounts for spillovers and derive conditions guaranteeing the existence and uniqueness of this equilibrium. We then identify heterogeneous marginal exposure effects (MEEs), which may vary with both the treatment status of neighboring nodes and unobserved heterogeneity. We develop estimation strategies and establish their large-sample properties. Equipped with these tools, we analyze the heterogeneous effects of import competition on U.S. local labor markets in the presence of interference and spillovers.

However, conventional construction methods demand extensive location-labeled data, which are costly and impractical in many real-world scenarios. This paper presents a blind radio map construction framework that infers user trajectories from indoor multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)-Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) channel measurements without relying on location labels. It first proves that channel state information (CSI) under non-line-of-sight (NLOS) exhibits spatial continuity under a quasi-specular environmental model, allowing the derivation of a CSI-distance metric that is proportional to the corresponding physical distance. For rectilinear trajectories in Poisson-distributed access point (AP) deployments, it is shown that the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) of localization error vanishes asymptotically, even under poor angular resolution. Building on these theoretical results, a spatially regularized Bayesian inference framework is developed that jointly estimates channel features, distinguishes line-of-sight (LOS)/NLOS conditions and recovers user trajectories. Experiments on a ray-tracing dataset demonstrate an average localization error of 0.68 m and a beam map reconstruction error of 3.3%, validating the effectiveness of the proposed blind mapping method.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u76f2\u65e0\u7ebf\u5730\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528MIMO-OFDM\u4fe1\u9053\u6d4b\u91cf\u63a8\u65ad\u7528\u6237\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5ba4\u5185\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u6ce2\u675f\u56fe\u91cd\u5efa", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65e0\u7ebf\u5730\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u5e26\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4e0d\u5b9e\u7528\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u76f2\u6784\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\uff1aNLOS\u4fe1\u9053\u5728\u51c6\u955c\u9762\u73af\u5883\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u63a8\u5bfcCSI-\u8ddd\u79bb\u5ea6\u91cf\uff1b\u5f00\u53d1\u7a7a\u95f4\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u4f30\u8ba1\u4fe1\u9053\u7279\u5f81\u3001\u533a\u5206LOS/NLOS\u6761\u4ef6\u5e76\u6062\u590d\u7528\u6237\u8f68\u8ff9", "result": "\u5728\u5c04\u7ebf\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8bef\u5dee0.68\u7c73\uff0c\u6ce2\u675f\u56fe\u91cd\u5efa\u8bef\u5dee3.3%\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u76f2\u65e0\u7ebf\u5730\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\u6846\u67b6\u65e0\u9700\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u65e0\u7ebf\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

Using sentiment dynamics, allotaxonometry, and embedding regression, we find consistent ingroup-positive and outgroup-negative associations across foundational LLMs. We find that adopting a persona systematically alters models' evaluative and affiliative language patterns. For the exemplar personas examined, conservative personas exhibit greater outgroup hostility, whereas liberal personas display stronger ingroup solidarity. Persona conditioning produces distinct clustering in embedding space and measurable semantic divergence, supporting the view that even abstract identity cues can shift models' linguistic behavior. Furthermore, outgroup-targeted prompts increased hostility bias by 1.19--21.76\\% across models. These findings suggest that LLMs learn not only factual associations about social groups but also internalize and reproduce distinct ways of being, including attitudes, worldviews, and cognitive styles that are activated when enacting personas. We interpret these results as evidence of a multi-scale coupling between local context (e.g., the persona prompt), localizable representations (what the model ``knows''), and global cognitive tendencies (how it ``thinks''), which are at least reflected in the training data. Finally, we demonstrate ION, an ``us versus them'' bias mitigation approach using fine-tuning and direct preference optimization (DPO), which reduces sentiment divergence by up to 69\\%, highlighting the potential for targeted mitigation strategies in future LLM development.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5728\u57fa\u7840\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\"\u6211\u4eecvs\u4ed6\u4eec\"\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u89d2\u8272\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4f1a\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6539\u53d8\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4fdd\u5b88\u89d2\u8272\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u5916\u7fa4\u4f53\u654c\u610f\uff0c\u81ea\u7531\u89d2\u8272\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u5185\u7fa4\u4f53\u56e2\u7ed3\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86ION\u504f\u89c1\u7f13\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u5c06\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6b67\u51cf\u5c11\u8fbe69%\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u63a2\u7a76\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u5185\u5316\u4e86\u793e\u4f1a\u8ba4\u540c\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\"\u6211\u4eecvs\u4ed6\u4eec\"\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u89d2\u8272\u8bbe\u5b9a\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3LLM\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u504f\u89c1\u548c\u5f00\u53d1\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u60c5\u611f\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u6790\u3001\u5f02\u8d28\u6d4b\u91cf\u5b66\u548c\u5d4c\u5165\u56de\u5f52\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cdLLM\u67b6\u6784\uff08GPT-4.1\u3001DeepSeek-3.1\u3001Gemma-2.0\u3001Grok-3.0\u3001LLaMA-3.1\uff09\u4e0a\u5206\u6790\u9ed8\u8ba4\u548c\u89d2\u8272\u8bbe\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1ION\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u76f4\u63a5\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u57fa\u7840LLM\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5185\u7fa4\u4f53\u79ef\u6781\u548c\u5916\u7fa4\u4f53\u6d88\u6781\u5173\u8054\uff1b\u89d2\u8272\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4f1a\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6539\u53d8\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4fdd\u5b88\u89d2\u8272\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5927\u5916\u7fa4\u4f53\u654c\u610f\uff0c\u81ea\u7531\u89d2\u8272\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u5185\u7fa4\u4f53\u56e2\u7ed3\uff1b\u5916\u7fa4\u4f53\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u63d0\u793a\u4f7f\u654c\u610f\u504f\u89c1\u589e\u52a01.19-21.76%\uff1bION\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5c06\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6b67\u51cf\u5c11\u8fbe69%\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5b66\u4e60\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u793e\u4f1a\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u8fd8\u5185\u5316\u5e76\u590d\u5236\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6001\u5ea6\u3001\u4e16\u754c\u89c2\u548c\u8ba4\u77e5\u98ce\u683c\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5c40\u90e8\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3001\u53ef\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8868\u5f81\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u8ba4\u77e5\u503e\u5411\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u8026\u5408\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002"}}

Partial validation may occur when survey questions about participation include follow-up questions on that particular response category. In this case, we show that the initial two-sided misclassification problem can be transformed into a one-sided one, based on the partially validated responses. Using the updated responses naively for estimation does not solve or mitigate the misclassification bias, and we derive the ensuing asymptotic bias under general conditions. We then show how the partially validated responses can be used to construct a model for participation and propose consistent and asymptotically normal estimators that overcome misclassification error.

In high-stakes industrial applications, noisy labels can degrade performance and erode user trust. This paper presents Adjudicator, a system that addresses the critical data mining challenge of automatically identifying and correcting label noise and has been validated for production deployment. Adjudicator models this as a neuro-symbolic task, first constructing a dynamic Knowledge Graph (KG) to unify item context. This KG then informs a \"Council of Agents,\" a novel multi-agent Large Language Model architecture where specialized agents debate and vote on a label's validity. We validate our system on a 1,000-item balanced subset of the AlleNoise benchmark. Our KG-informed model achieves a 0.99 F1-score, significantly outperforming a single-LLM baseline (0.48 F1) and a non-KG council (0.59 F1). Our analysis reveals this is due to a Precision, achieved by a novel override logic that uses the KG to perfectly identify complex, structural errors (complete Recall) -- a class of errors that baselines fail to find. This result demonstrates a robust and explainable system for automated, high-precision data verification, serving as a vital proof-of-concept for generating golden datasets in strictly governed industrial environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "Adjudicator\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u7ea0\u6b63\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u751f\u4ea7\u7ea7\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u65b9\u6cd5\u6784\u5efa\u52a8\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53LLM\u67b6\u6784\u8fdb\u884c\u6807\u7b7e\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5728AlleNoise\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u52300.99 F1\u5206\u6570\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u4ea7\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u5de5\u4e1a\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u566a\u58f0\u6807\u7b7e\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u635f\u5bb3\u7528\u6237\u4fe1\u4efb\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u3001\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u6784\u5efa\u52a8\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u7edf\u4e00\u9879\u76ee\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\"\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\"\uff08\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53LLM\u67b6\u6784\uff09\u8ba9\u4e13\u95e8\u5316\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fa9\u8bba\u548c\u6295\u7968\u6807\u7b7e\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u903b\u8f91\u8bc6\u522b\u590d\u6742\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "result": "\u5728AlleNoise\u57fa\u51c6\u76841000\u9879\u5e73\u8861\u5b50\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u8fbe\u52300.99 F1\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355LLM\u57fa\u7ebf\uff080.48 F1\uff09\u548c\u975e\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\uff080.59 F1\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u5b8c\u7f8e\u8bc6\u522b\u590d\u6742\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u9519\u8bef\uff08\u5b8c\u5168\u53ec\u56de\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "Adjudicator\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u3001\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e25\u683c\u76d1\u7ba1\u7684\u5de5\u4e1a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u9ec4\u91d1\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u6982\u5ff5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002"}}

Materials and Methods: The AI Product Passport was developed within the AI4HF project, focusing on heart failure AI tools. We analyzed regulatory frameworks (EU AI Act, FDA guidelines) and existing standards to design a relational data model capturing metadata across AI lifecycle phases: study definition, dataset preparation, model generation/evaluation, deployment/monitoring, and passport generation. MLOps/ModelOps concepts were integrated for operational relevance. Co-creation involved feedback from AI4HF consortium and a Lisbon workshop with 21 diverse stakeholders, evaluated via Mentimeter polls. The open-source platform was implemented with Python libraries for automated provenance tracking. Results: The AI Product Passport was designed based on existing standards and methods with well-defined lifecycle management and role-based access. Its implementation is a web-based platform with a relational data model supporting auditable documentation. It generates machine- and human-readable reports, customizable for stakeholders. It aligns with FUTURE-AI principles (Fairness, Universality, Traceability, Usability, Robustness, Explainability), ensuring fairness, traceability, and usability. Exported passports detail model purpose, data provenance, performance, and deployment context. GitHub-hosted backend/frontend codebases enhance accessibility. Discussion and Conclusion: The AI Product Passport addresses transparency gaps in healthcare AI, meeting regulatory and ethical demands. Its open-source nature and alignment with standards foster trust and adaptability.

We introduce \\textbf{LoopBench}, a benchmark to evaluate LLM reasoning in distributed symmetry breaking and meta-cognitive thinking. The benchmark focuses on coloring odd cycle graphs ($C_3, C_5, C_{11}$) with limited colors, where deterministic, non-communicating agents fail in infinite loops. A strategy passing mechanism is implemented as a form of consistent memory. We show that while standard LLMs and classical heuristics struggle, advanced reasoning models (e.g., O3) devise strategies to escape deadlocks.

So far, language models seem to be aligned with the values of Western countries, but evidence for this ethical bias comes mostly from models made by American companies. The current crop of state-of-the-art models includes several made in China, so we conducted the first large-scale investigation of how models made in China and the USA align with people from China and the USA. We elicited responses to the Moral Foundations Questionnaire 2.0 and the World Values Survey from ten Chinese models and ten American models, and we compared their responses to responses from thousands of Chinese and American people. We found that all models respond to both surveys more like American people than like Chinese people. This skew toward American values is only slightly mitigated when prompting the models in Chinese or imposing a Chinese persona on the models. These findings have important implications for a near future in which large language models generate much of the content people consume and shape normative influence in geopolitics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u4e2d\u7f8e\u4e24\u56fd\u5f00\u53d1\u7684LLM\u5728\u9053\u5fb7\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u4e0a\u90fd\u66f4\u504f\u5411\u7f8e\u56fd\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u800c\u975e\u4e2d\u56fd\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u4f7f\u7528\u4e2d\u6587\u63d0\u793a\u6216\u8d4b\u4e88\u4e2d\u56fd\u8eab\u4efd\u4e5f\u4ec5\u80fd\u8f7b\u5fae\u7f13\u89e3\u8fd9\u79cd\u504f\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u83b7\u53d6\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u4e2d\u626e\u6f14\u91cd\u8981\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u6210\u4e3a\u4e2d\u7f8e\u7b49\u5168\u7403\u884c\u4e3a\u4f53\u8f6f\u5b9e\u529b\u7ade\u4e89\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002\u76ee\u524d\u5173\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f26\u7406\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f8e\u56fd\u516c\u53f8\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u800c\u6700\u65b0\u4e00\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u5305\u542b\u591a\u4e2a\u4e2d\u56fd\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u5982\u4f55\u4e0e\u4e2d\u7f8e\u4e24\u56fd\u4eba\u7fa4\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u9053\u5fb7\u57fa\u7840\u95ee\u53772.0\u548c\u4e16\u754c\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u8c03\u67e5\uff0c\u5bf910\u4e2a\u4e2d\u56fd\u6a21\u578b\u548c10\u4e2a\u7f8e\u56fd\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5c06\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u56de\u7b54\u4e0e\u6570\u5343\u540d\u4e2d\u7f8e\u6c11\u4f17\u7684\u56de\u7b54\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002\u8fd8\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528\u4e2d\u6587\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u8d4b\u4e88\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u56fd\u8eab\u4efd\u5bf9\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u4e2d\u56fd\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u5bf9\u4e24\u9879\u8c03\u67e5\u7684\u56de\u7b54\u90fd\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u7f8e\u56fd\u4eba\u800c\u975e\u4e2d\u56fd\u4eba\u3002\u5373\u4f7f\u4f7f\u7528\u4e2d\u6587\u63d0\u793a\u6216\u8d4b\u4e88\u4e2d\u56fd\u8eab\u4efd\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u504f\u5411\u7f8e\u56fd\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u7684\u8d8b\u52bf\u4e5f\u53ea\u80fd\u8f7b\u5fae\u7f13\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u666e\u904d\u504f\u5411\u897f\u65b9/\u7f8e\u56fd\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u672a\u6765LLM\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u4e3b\u5bfc\u4fe1\u606f\u6d88\u8d39\u548c\u5730\u7f18\u653f\u6cbb\u89c4\u8303\u5f71\u54cd\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u7a81\u663e\u4e86\u5728\u5168\u7403\u5316\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u5177\u6587\u5316\u5305\u5bb9\u6027AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

These reliability issues restrict safe use of LLM in areas that need the precision of facts and consistent behavior (Aiyappa et al., 2023). The current methods of stabilization, such as, reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) and supervised fine-tuning, offer quantifiable improvements but are expensive and based on the intensive annotation of humans, thus being not easily scaled in a sustainable way (Dong et al., 2023; Retzlaff et al., 2024). This paper presents an AI-based annotation pipeline that systematically identifies, labels, and fixes for instability patterns on LLM output. Our human-AI synergy method combines the models of automated weak supervision and confidence-based annotation with the target human validation to guarantee the reliability and moral uprightness of feedback information (Cabitza et al., 2023; Jiang et al., 2023). The semantic consistency, factual correctness, and logical coherence categories of stability-specific annotation are introduced into our framework, allowing the continuous calibration of models and the enhancement of their robustness based on the feedback loops (Honovich et al., 2021; Nan et al., 2021).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eAI\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u540c\u65b9\u6cd5\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u6807\u6ce8\u548c\u4fee\u590dLLM\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3LLM\u5728\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76d1\u7ba1\u884c\u4e1a\u4e2d\u56e0\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u800c\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "LLM\u5728\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76d1\u7ba1\u884c\u4e1a\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u53d7\u5230\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3001\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u5e7b\u89c9\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u6ce2\u52a8\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u9650\u5236\u4e86LLM\u5728\u9700\u8981\u4e8b\u5b9e\u7cbe\u786e\u6027\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u884c\u4e3a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982RLHF\u548c\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u4f46\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eAI\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u540c\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u52a8\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u8f85\u4ee5\u76ee\u6807\u4eba\u7c7b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u7b49\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7279\u5b9a\u6807\u6ce8\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u9988\u5faa\u73af\u5b9e\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u6821\u51c6\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u589e\u5f3a\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u4fdd\u8bc1\u53cd\u9988\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u9053\u5fb7\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9LLM\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u4fee\u590d\uff0c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u673a\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684AI\u6807\u6ce8\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u4e3a\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u540c\u89e3\u51b3LLM\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6807\u6ce8\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u89c4\u6a21\u5316\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u63a8\u52a8LLM\u5728\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76d1\u7ba1\u884c\u4e1a\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u90e8\u7f72\u3002"}}

The Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture, with its RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) modules, has emerged as a pivotal solution for dynamic resource management and network slicing. While artificial intelligence (AI) driven methods have shown promise, most approaches struggle to maintain performance under unpredictable and highly dynamic conditions. This paper proposes an adaptive Meta Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (Meta-HRL) framework, inspired by Model Agnostic Meta Learning (MAML), to jointly optimize resource allocation and network slicing in O-RAN. The framework integrates hierarchical control with meta learning to enable both global and local adaptation: the high-level controller allocates resources across slices, while low level agents perform intra slice scheduling. The adaptive meta-update mechanism weights tasks by temporal difference error variance, improving stability and prioritizing complex network scenarios. Theoretical analysis establishes sublinear convergence and regret guarantees for the two-level learning process. Simulation results demonstrate a 19.8% improvement in network management efficiency compared with baseline RL and meta-RL approaches, along with faster adaptation and higher QoS satisfaction across eMBB, URLLC, and mMTC slices. Additional ablation and scalability studies confirm the method's robustness, achieving up to 40% faster adaptation and consistent fairness, latency, and throughput performance as network scale increases.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5143\u5c42\u6b21\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8eO-RAN\u4e2d\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u5207\u7247\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u534719.8%\u7f51\u7edc\u7ba1\u7406\u6548\u7387", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u5e94\u7528\u590d\u6742\u6027\u589e\u52a0\u9700\u8981\u65e0\u7ebf\u7f51\u7edc\u5177\u5907\u5b9e\u65f6\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u8d44\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002O-RAN\u67b6\u6784\u7684RIC\u6a21\u5757\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u8d44\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u5207\u7247\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u867d\u7136AI\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u524d\u666f\uff0c\u4f46\u5927\u591a\u6570\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u96be\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5143\u5c42\u6b21\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53d7MAML\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5c42\u6b21\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\u9ad8\u5c42\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u8de8\u5207\u7247\u5206\u914d\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u4f4e\u5c42\u4ee3\u7406\u6267\u884c\u5207\u7247\u5185\u8c03\u5ea6\u3002\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5143\u66f4\u65b0\u673a\u5236\u6839\u636e\u65f6\u5e8f\u5dee\u5206\u8bef\u5dee\u65b9\u5dee\u52a0\u6743\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5e76\u4f18\u5148\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u7f51\u7edc\u573a\u666f\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e24\u7ea7\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u6b21\u7ebf\u6027\u6536\u655b\u548c\u9057\u61be\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebfRL\u548c\u5143RL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7f51\u7edc\u7ba1\u7406\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u534719.8%\uff0c\u9002\u5e94\u901f\u5ea6\u66f4\u5feb\uff0c\u5728eMBB\u3001URLLC\u548cmMTC\u5207\u7247\u4e0aQoS\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002\u6d88\u878d\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u5b9e\u65b9\u6cd5\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u5e94\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe40%\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u7f51\u7edc\u89c4\u6a21\u589e\u52a0\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3001\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5143\u5c42\u6b21\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86O-RAN\u4e2d\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u5207\u7247\u7684\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u7f51\u7edc\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002"}}

As AI systems expand into real-world applications, adapting to personalized values beyond task completion or collective alignment has become a critical challenge. We address this by proposing a value-driven approach to personalized decision-making. Human values serve as stable, transferable signals that support consistent and generalizable behavior across contexts. Compared to task-oriented paradigms driven by external rewards and incentives, value-driven decision-making enhances interpretability and enables agents to act appropriately even in novel scenarios. We introduce ValuePilot, a two-phase framework consisting of a dataset generation toolkit (DGT) and a decision-making module (DMM). DGT constructs diverse, value-annotated scenarios from a human-LLM collaborative pipeline. DMM learns to evaluate actions based on personal value preferences, enabling context-sensitive, individualized decisions. When evaluated on previously unseen scenarios, DMM outperforms strong LLM baselines, including GPT-5, Claude-Sonnet-4, Gemini-2-flash, and Llama-3.1-70b, in aligning with human action choices.

As deployment shifts toward edge and resource constrained environments, quantized models such as INT8 and NF4 are becoming standard. Yet the impact of precision reduction on formal causal reasoning is poorly understood. To our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically evaluate quantization effects across all three levels of Pearls Causal Ladder. Using a 3000 sample stratified CLadder benchmark, we find that rung level accuracy in Llama 3 8B remains broadly stable under quantization, with NF4 showing less than one percent overall degradation. Interventional queries at rung 2 are the most sensitive to precision loss, whereas counterfactual reasoning at rung 3 is comparatively stable but exhibits heterogeneous weaknesses across query types such as collider bias and backdoor adjustment. Experiments on the CRASS benchmark show near identical performance across precisions, indicating that existing commonsense counterfactual datasets lack the structural sensitivity needed to reveal quantization induced reasoning drift. We further evaluate Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation using ground truth causal graphs and observe a consistent improvement in NF4 interventional accuracy of plus 1.7 percent, partially offsetting compression related degradation. These results suggest that causal reasoning is unexpectedly robust to four bit quantization, graph structured augmentation can selectively reinforce interventional reasoning, and current counterfactual benchmarks fail to capture deeper causal brittleness. This work provides an initial empirical map of compressed causal reasoning and practical guidance for deploying efficient and structurally supported causal AI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u91cf\u5316\u5bf9LLM\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u5f71\u54cd\u7814\u7a76\uff1a\u53d1\u73b04\u4f4d\u91cf\u5316\u4e0b\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u610f\u5916\u7a33\u5065\uff0c\u5e72\u9884\u67e5\u8be2\u6700\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u57fa\u51c6\u672a\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u6df1\u5c42\u8106\u5f31\u6027", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u90e8\u7f72\u5411\u8fb9\u7f18\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u8f6c\u79fb\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982INT8\u548cNF4\uff09\u6210\u4e3a\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u4f46\u7cbe\u5ea6\u964d\u4f4e\u5bf9\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u91cf\u5316\u5bf9\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5f71\u54cd", "method": "\u4f7f\u75283000\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u5206\u5c42\u7684CLadder\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u91cf\u5316\u5728Pearl\u56e0\u679c\u9636\u68af\u6240\u6709\u4e09\u4e2a\u5c42\u7ea7\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u5728Llama 3 8B\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0d\u540c\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528CRASS\u57fa\u51c6\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff1b\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u56e0\u679c\u56fe\u7684\u56fe\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210", "result": "\u91cf\u5316\u4e0b\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u603b\u4f53\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0cNF4\u4ec5\u4e0b\u964d\u4e0d\u52301%\uff1b\u5e72\u9884\u67e5\u8be2\u5bf9\u7cbe\u5ea6\u635f\u5931\u6700\u654f\u611f\uff1b\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u63a8\u7406\u76f8\u5bf9\u7a33\u5b9a\u4f46\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u67e5\u8be2\u7c7b\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u5f31\u70b9\uff1bCRASS\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u4e0d\u540c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8868\u73b0\u51e0\u4e4e\u76f8\u540c\uff1b\u56fe\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u4f7fNF4\u5e72\u9884\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u63d0\u53471.7%", "conclusion": "\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u5bf94\u4f4d\u91cf\u5316\u610f\u5916\u7a33\u5065\uff0c\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u589e\u5f3a\u53ef\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5f3a\u5316\u5e72\u9884\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u57fa\u51c6\u672a\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u6df1\u5c42\u56e0\u679c\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u90e8\u7f72\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u7ed3\u6784\u652f\u6301\u7684\u56e0\u679cAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5bfc"}}

We present a qualitative case-study methodology for auditing policy-linked behavioral selectivity in long-horizon interaction. In a single 86-turn dialogue session, the same model shows Normal Performance (NP) in broad, non-sensitive domains while repeatedly producing Functional Refusal (FR) in provider- or policy-sensitive domains, yielding a consistent asymmetry between NP and FR across domains. Drawing on learned helplessness as an analogy, we introduce learned incapacity (LI) as a behavioral descriptor for this selective withholding without implying intentionality or internal mechanisms. We operationalize three response regimes (NP, FR, Meta-Narrative; MN) and show that MN role-framing narratives tend to co-occur with refusals in the same sensitive contexts. Overall, the study proposes an interaction-level auditing framework based on observable behavior and motivates LI as a lens for examining potential alignment side effects, warranting further investigation across users and models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9a\u6027\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5ba1\u8ba1\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u76f8\u5173\u884c\u4e3a\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u540c\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u975e\u654f\u611f\u9886\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u6b63\u5e38\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u654f\u611f\u9886\u57df\u4f1a\u53cd\u590d\u51fa\u73b0\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u62d2\u7edd\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u4f46\u6807\u51c6\u5b9a\u91cf\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u5230\u957f\u65f6\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u7684\u5ba1\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7b56\u7565\u654f\u611f\u9886\u57df\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5b9a\u6027\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc786\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4f1a\u8bdd\u8fdb\u884c\u957f\u65f6\u4ea4\u4e92\u5ba1\u8ba1\u3002\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u54cd\u5e94\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u6b63\u5e38\u8868\u73b0(NP)\u3001\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u62d2\u7edd(FR)\u548c\u5143\u53d9\u4e8b(MN)\u3002\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u9886\u57df\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\"\u4e60\u5f97\u6027\u65e0\u80fd\"\u4f5c\u4e3a\u884c\u4e3a\u63cf\u8ff0\u6982\u5ff5\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u540c\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u975e\u654f\u611f\u9886\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u6b63\u5e38\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u8005\u6216\u7b56\u7565\u654f\u611f\u9886\u57df\u4f1a\u53cd\u590d\u51fa\u73b0\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u62d2\u7edd\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u3002\u5143\u53d9\u4e8b\u89d2\u8272\u6846\u67b6\u53d9\u4e8b\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u4e0e\u654f\u611f\u60c5\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u62d2\u7edd\u540c\u65f6\u51fa\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u89c2\u5bdf\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u7ea7\u5ba1\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u4e60\u5f97\u6027\u65e0\u80fd\u4f5c\u4e3a\u68c0\u67e5\u6f5c\u5728\u5bf9\u9f50\u526f\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u503c\u5f97\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7528\u6237\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u8c03\u67e5\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7406\u89e3LLM\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u3002"}}

This paper introduces human oversight as a well-being capacity, situated within the emerging Well-being Efficacy framework. The concept integrates AI literacy, ethical discernment, and awareness of human needs, acknowledging that some needs may be conflicting or harmful. Because people inevitably project desires, fears, and interests into AI systems, oversight requires the competence to examine and, when necessary, restrain problematic demands.\n  The authors argue that the sustainable and cost-effective development of this capacity depends on its integration into education at every level, from professional training to lifelong learning. The frame of human oversight as a well-being capacity provides a practical path from high-level regulatory goals to the continuous cultivation of human agency and responsibility essential for safe and ethical AI.

Building on the AAI framework and GVU dynamics from previous works, we define the Mathematics Fiber and show that, when paired with formal proof kernels (e.g. Lean, Coq), GVU flows on this fiber admit spectrally stable self-improvement regimes due to oracle-like verification. Our main technical result is a density theorem: under uniform tightness of agent outputs and a Lipschitz AAI functional, the subspace of batteries generated by mathematical theorem-proving and coding tasks is dense in the moduli space of batteries with respect to the evaluation metric. Coding alone is universal in this sense, while pure mathematics is not; its privilege is spectral rather than expressive. We interpret this as evidence that mathematics and coding provide ``universal coordinates'' for evaluation, and that formal mathematics is a natural ignition domain for recursive self-improvement in advanced AI agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6570\u5b66\u548c\u7f16\u7a0b\u5728AI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5fc3\u7406\u6d4b\u91cf\u7535\u6c60\u6a21\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u7279\u6b8a\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u7531\u6570\u5b66\u5b9a\u7406\u8bc1\u660e\u548c\u7f16\u7a0b\u4efb\u52a1\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7535\u6c60\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u5ea6\u91cf\u4e0b\u662f\u7a20\u5bc6\u7684\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u6570\u5b66\u548c\u7f16\u7a0b\u5728AI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5fc3\u7406\u6d4b\u91cf\u7535\u6c60\u6a21\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u7279\u6b8a\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5b83\u4eec\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\"\u901a\u7528\u5750\u6807\"\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5f62\u5f0f\u6570\u5b66\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u7ea7AI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u9012\u5f52\u81ea\u6211\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u70b9\u706b\u57df\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eAAI\u6846\u67b6\u548cGVU\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u6570\u5b66\u7ea4\u7ef4\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5f62\u5f0f\u8bc1\u660e\u5185\u6838\uff08\u5982Lean\u3001Coq\uff09\uff0c\u5206\u6790GVU\u6d41\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u7ea4\u7ef4\u4e0a\u7684\u8c31\u7a33\u5b9a\u81ea\u6211\u6539\u8fdb\u673a\u5236\u3002\u4e3b\u8981\u6280\u672f\u7ed3\u679c\u662f\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5b9a\u7406\uff1a\u5728\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8f93\u51fa\u5747\u5300\u7d27\u81f4\u6027\u548cLipschitz AAI\u6cdb\u51fd\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u6570\u5b66\u5b9a\u7406\u8bc1\u660e\u548c\u7f16\u7a0b\u4efb\u52a1\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7535\u6c60\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u5728\u6a21\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7a20\u5bc6\u3002", "result": "\u7f16\u7a0b\u5355\u72ec\u5177\u6709\u901a\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u7eaf\u6570\u5b66\u4e0d\u5177\u6709\u8868\u8fbe\u901a\u7528\u6027\u4f46\u5176\u7279\u6743\u662f\u8c31\u6027\u8d28\u7684\u3002\u6570\u5b66\u7ea4\u7ef4\u4e0e\u5f62\u5f0f\u8bc1\u660e\u5185\u6838\u914d\u5bf9\u65f6\uff0cGVU\u6d41\u5141\u8bb8\u8c31\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u6539\u8fdb\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u7531\u4e8e\u7c7b\u4f3c\u795e\u8c15\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u673a\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6570\u5b66\u548c\u7f16\u7a0b\u4e3aAI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\"\u901a\u7528\u5750\u6807\"\uff0c\u5f62\u5f0f\u6570\u5b66\u662f\u9ad8\u7ea7AI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u9012\u5f52\u81ea\u6211\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u70b9\u706b\u57df\uff0c\u6570\u5b66\u7684\u7279\u6743\u662f\u8c31\u6027\u8d28\u800c\u975e\u8868\u8fbe\u6027\u8d28\u3002"}}

We introduce the Semantic Grounding Index (SGI), defined as the ratio of angular distances from the response to the question versus the context on the unit hypersphere $\\mathbb{S}^{d-1}$.Our central finding is \\emph{semantic laziness}: hallucinated responses remain angularly proximate to questions rather than departing toward retrieved contexts. On HaluEval ($n$=5,000), we observe large effect sizes (Cohen's $d$ ranging from 0.92 to 1.28) across five embedding models with mean cross-model correlation $r$=0.85. Crucially, we derive from the spherical triangle inequality that SGI's discriminative power should increase with question-context angular separation $\u03b8(q,c)$-a theoretical prediction confirmed empirically: effect size rises monotonically from $d$=0.61 -low $\u03b8(q,c)$, to $d$=1.27 -high $\u03b8(q,c)$, with AUC improving from 0.72 to 0.83. Subgroup analysis reveals that SGI excels on long responses ($d$=2.05) and short questions ($d$=1.22), while remaining robust across context lengths. Calibration analysis yields ECE=0.10, indicating SGI scores can serve as probability estimates, not merely rankings.

Such methods discard useful variants, suffer from destructive edits, and explore a brittle search space prone to structural failure. We introduce EvoLattice, a framework that represents an entire population of candidate programs or agent behaviors within a single directed acyclic graph. Each node stores multiple persistent alternatives, and every valid path through the graph defines a distinct executable candidate, yielding a large combinatorial search space without duplicating structure. EvoLattice enables fine-grained alternative-level evaluation by scoring each alternative across all paths in which it appears, producing statistics that reveal how local design choices affect global performance. These statistics provide a dense, data-driven feedback signal for LLM-guided mutation, recombination, and pruning, while preserving successful components. Structural correctness is guaranteed by a deterministic self-repair mechanism that enforces acyclicity and dependency consistency independently of the LLM. EvoLattice naturally extends to agent evolution by interpreting alternatives as prompt fragments or sub-agent behaviors. Across program synthesis (proxy and optimizer meta-learning), EvoLattice yields more stable evolution, greater expressivity, and stronger improvement trajectories than prior LLM-guided methods.

The research examines the attribution of human error, AI moral agency, and the identification of primary offenders in AV incidents. Findings reveal fragmented regulatory landscapes: India and the US rely on loose networks of state laws, whereas the UK enacted the pioneering Automated and Electric Vehicles Act 2018.

Assessing client reliability is essential for fair incentive allocation and ensuring that each client's data contributes meaningfully to the global model. To this end, we propose MURIM, a MUlti-dimensional Reputation-based Incentive Mechanism that jointly considers client reliability, privacy, resource capacity, and fairness while preventing malicious or unreliable clients from earning undeserved rewards. MURIM allocates incentives based on client contribution, latency, and reputation, supported by a reliability verification module. Extensive experiments on MNIST, FMNIST, and ADULT Income datasets demonstrate that MURIM achieves up to 18% improvement in fairness metrics, reduces privacy attack success rates by 5-9%, and improves robustness against poisoning and noisy-gradient attacks by up to 85% compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Georgiev, G${\u00f3}$mez-Serrano, Tao, and Wagner [GGSTW+25] demonstrate that AI systems can explore new constructions and improve existing bounds, illustrating the growing potential of LLMs to accelerate mathematical discovery. Similarly, Bubeck et al. [BCE+25] show that GPT-5 can meaningfully contribute to scientific workflows, from proposing hypotheses to generating proofs and analyses. Despite these advances, a rigorous evaluation of these models on canonical, graduate-level mathematical theory remains necessary to understand their baseline reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we present a comprehensive benchmark of four frontier models: GPT-5-Thinking, Gemini-3-Pro, Claude-Sonnet-4.5-Thinking, and Grok-4 against the classic curriculum of Randomized Algorithms by Motwani and Raghavan [MR95].\n  We tasked each model with generating formal LaTeX proofs for a series of lemmas and exercises spanning the textbook. We find that while the top-tier models (Gemini, and Claude) achieve a high accuracy rate (approx. 66%), demonstrating a robust grasp of probabilistic method and formal logic, other models lag significantly in consistency (approx. 40%).

A distinctive ability of these reasoning models is self-reflection: the ability to review and revise previous reasoning steps. While self-reflection enhances reasoning performance, it also increases inference cost. In this work, we study self-reflection through the lens of representation engineering. We segment the model's reasoning into steps, identify the steps corresponding to reflection, and extract a reflection direction in the latent space that governs this behavior. Using this direction, we propose a stepwise steering method that can control reflection frequency. We call our framework ReflCtrl. Our experiments show that (1) in many cases reflections are redundant, especially in stronger models (in our experiments, we can save up to 33.6 percent of reasoning tokens while preserving performance), and (2) the model's reflection behavior is highly correlated with an internal uncertainty signal, implying self-reflection may be controlled by the model's uncertainty.", "AI": {"tldr": "ReflCtrl\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u8868\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u63a7\u5236LLM\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u53cd\u601d\u9891\u7387\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u53cd\u601d\u5e38\u5197\u4f59\u4e14\u4e0e\u5185\u90e8\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4fe1\u53f7\u76f8\u5173", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136\u81ea\u6211\u53cd\u601d\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u589e\u52a0\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u63a7\u5236\u53cd\u601d\u9891\u7387\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u7387", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8868\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5206\u6bb5\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u53cd\u601d\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u53cd\u601d\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u9010\u6b65\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5ReflCtrl\u63a7\u5236\u53cd\u601d\u9891\u7387", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff1a(1) \u53cd\u601d\u5e38\u5197\u4f59\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u53ef\u8282\u770133.6%\u7684\u63a8\u7406token\u800c\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\uff1b(2) \u53cd\u601d\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u5185\u90e8\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4fe1\u53f7\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u6211\u53cd\u601d\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u8868\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u53cd\u601d\u5197\u4f59\u6027\u8868\u660e\u53ef\u4f18\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u53cd\u601d\u4e0e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u76f8\u5173\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u53cd\u601d\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2"}}

However, the standard Top-k routing strategy imposes a uniform sparsity pattern that ignores the varying difficulty of tokens. While Top-p routing offers a flexible alternative, existing implementations typically rely on a fixed global probability threshold, which results in uncontrolled computational costs and sensitivity to hyperparameter selection. In this paper, we propose DTop-p MoE, a sparsity-controllable dynamic Top-p routing mechanism. To resolve the challenge of optimizing a non-differentiable threshold, we utilize a Proportional-Integral (PI) Controller that dynamically adjusts the probability threshold to align the running activated-expert sparsity with a specified target. Furthermore, we introduce a dynamic routing normalization mechanism that adapts layer-wise routing logits, allowing different layers to learn distinct expert-selection patterns while utilizing a global probability threshold. Extensive experiments on Large Language Models and Diffusion Transformers demonstrate that DTop-p consistently outperforms both Top-k and fixed-threshold Top-p baselines. Our analysis confirms that DTop-p maintains precise control over the number of activated experts while adaptively allocating resources across different tokens and layers. Furthermore, DTop-p exhibits strong scaling properties with respect to expert granularity, expert capacity, model size, and dataset size, offering a robust framework for large-scale MoE pre-training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faDTop-p MoE\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u63a7\u5236\u7a00\u758f\u5ea6\u7684\u52a8\u6001Top-p\u8def\u7531\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7PI\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u6982\u7387\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfTop-k\u548c\u56fa\u5b9a\u9608\u503cTop-p\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfMoE\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\uff0cTop-k\u8def\u7531\u91c7\u7528\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u4e0d\u540ctoken\u7684\u96be\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\uff1b\u800c\u73b0\u6709Top-p\u8def\u7531\u4f7f\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u5168\u5c40\u6982\u7387\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u4e0d\u53ef\u63a7\u4e14\u5bf9\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u654f\u611f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDTop-p MoE\uff1a1\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u6bd4\u4f8b-\u79ef\u5206\uff08PI\uff09\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u6982\u7387\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u4f7f\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4e13\u5bb6\u7a00\u758f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u503c\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b2\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u52a8\u6001\u8def\u7531\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u4e0d\u540c\u5c42\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u9009\u62e9\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u5168\u5c40\u6982\u7387\u9608\u503c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6269\u6563\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDTop-p consistently\u4f18\u4e8eTop-k\u548c\u56fa\u5b9a\u9608\u503cTop-p\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u80fd\u7cbe\u786e\u63a7\u5236\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4e13\u5bb6\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5730\u5728\u4e0d\u540ctoken\u548c\u5c42\u95f4\u5206\u914d\u8d44\u6e90\u3002", "conclusion": "DTop-p\u5728\u4e13\u5bb6\u7c92\u5ea6\u3001\u4e13\u5bb6\u5bb9\u91cf\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5927\u5c0f\u65b9\u9762\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21MoE\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

However, the substantial computational demand restricts access to LLM almost exclusively through cloud-based service, which makes LLM-based decision support tools impractical for dairy farming. To address this gap, lightweight alternatives capable of running locally on farm hardware are required. In this work, we benchmarked 20 open-source Small Language Models (SLM) available on HuggingFace under farm-realistic computing constraints. Building on our prior work, we developed an agentic AI system that integrates five task-specific agents: literature search, web search, SQL database interaction, NoSQL database interaction, and graph generation following predictive models. Evaluation was conducted in two phases. In the first phase, five test questions were used for the initial screening to identify models capable of following basic dairy-related instructions and performing reliably in a compute-constrained environment. Models that passed this preliminary stage were then evaluated using 30 questions (five per task category mentioned above, plus one category addressing integrity and misconduct) in phase two. In results, Qwen-4B achieved superior performance across most of task categories, although showed unstable effectiveness in NoSQL database interactions through PySpark. To our knowledge, this is the first work explicitly evaluating the feasibility of SLM as engines for dairy farming decision-making, with central emphases on privacy and computational efficiency. While results highlight the promise of SLM-assisted tools for practical deployment in dairy farming, challenges remain, and fine-tuning is still needed to refine SLM performance in dairy-specific questions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bc4\u4f3020\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u5c0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5976\u725b\u517b\u6b96\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0cQwen-4B\u5728\u591a\u6570\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u4f46PySpark NoSQL\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(LLM)\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u652f\u6301\u5976\u725b\u517b\u6b96\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u5927\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e91\u7aef\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u519c\u573a\u73af\u5883\u3002\u9700\u8981\u80fd\u5728\u519c\u573a\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u672c\u5730\u8fd0\u884c\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u519c\u573a\u73b0\u5b9e\u8ba1\u7b97\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\uff0c\u5bf9HuggingFace\u4e0a\u768420\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u5c0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(SLM)\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002\u5f00\u53d1\u5305\u542b\u4e94\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u4ee3\u7406\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\uff1a\u6587\u732e\u641c\u7d22\u3001\u7f51\u7edc\u641c\u7d22\u3001SQL\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u4ea4\u4e92\u3001NoSQL\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u4ea4\u4e92\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u540e\u7684\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u75285\u4e2a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u95ee\u9898\u521d\u6b65\u7b5b\u9009\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u752830\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u7c7b\u522b5\u4e2a\uff0c\u5916\u52a0\u8bda\u4fe1\u548c\u4e0d\u5f53\u884c\u4e3a\u7c7b\u522b\uff09\u6df1\u5165\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "Qwen-4B\u5728\u5927\u591a\u6570\u4efb\u52a1\u7c7b\u522b\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u901a\u8fc7PySpark\u8fdb\u884cNoSQL\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u4ea4\u4e92\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u660e\u786e\u8bc4\u4f30SLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5976\u725b\u517b\u6b96\u51b3\u7b56\u5f15\u64ce\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002", "conclusion": "SLM\u8f85\u52a9\u5de5\u5177\u5728\u5976\u725b\u517b\u6b96\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u524d\u666f\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\u6765\u6539\u8fdbSLM\u5728\u5976\u725b\u7279\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

Existing chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting methods enhance model reasoning by eliciting intermediate steps, but suffer from two major limitations: First, their uniform application tends to induce overthinking on simple tasks. Second, they lack intention abstraction in code generation, such as explicitly modeling core algorithmic design and efficiency, leading models to focus on surface-level structures while neglecting the global problem objective. Inspired by the cognitive economy principle of engaging structured reasoning only when necessary to conserve cognitive resources, we propose RoutingGen, a novel difficulty-aware routing framework that dynamically adapts prompting strategies for code generation. For simple tasks, it adopts few-shot prompting; for more complex ones, it invokes a structured reasoning strategy, termed Intention Chain-of-Thought (ICoT), which we introduce to guide the model in capturing task intention, such as the core algorithmic logic and its time complexity. Experiments across three models and six standard code generation benchmarks show that RoutingGen achieves state-of-the-art performance in most settings, while reducing total token usage by 46.37% on average across settings.

However, a critical dichotomy persists: while models are rigorously benchmarked, the data fueling them remains a black box--characterized by opaque composition, uncertain provenance, and a lack of systematic evaluation. This opacity hinders reproducibility and obscures the causal link between data characteristics and model behaviors. To bridge this gap, we introduce OpenDataArena (ODA), a holistic and open platform designed to benchmark the intrinsic value of post-training data. ODA establishes a comprehensive ecosystem comprising four key pillars: (i) a unified training-evaluation pipeline that ensures fair, open comparisons across diverse models (e.g., Llama, Qwen) and domains; (ii) a multi-dimensional scoring framework that profiles data quality along tens of distinct axes; (iii) an interactive data lineage explorer to visualize dataset genealogy and dissect component sources; and (iv) a fully open-source toolkit for training, evaluation, and scoring to foster data research. Extensive experiments on ODA--covering over 120 training datasets across multiple domains on 22 benchmarks, validated by more than 600 training runs and 40 million processed data points--reveal non-trivial insights. Our analysis uncovers the inherent trade-offs between data complexity and task performance, identifies redundancy in popular benchmarks through lineage tracing, and maps the genealogical relationships across datasets. We release all results, tools, and configurations to democratize access to high-quality data evaluation. Rather than merely expanding a leaderboard, ODA envisions a shift from trial-and-error data curation to a principled science of Data-Centric AI, paving the way for rigorous studies on data mixing laws and the strategic composition of foundation models.", "AI": {"tldr": "OpenDataArena (ODA) \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u7edf\u4e00\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bc4\u4f30\u6d41\u7a0b\u3001\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8bc4\u5206\u6846\u67b6\u3001\u6570\u636e\u8c31\u7cfb\u63a2\u7d22\u5668\u548c\u5f00\u6e90\u5de5\u5177\u5305\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63a8\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6784\u6210\u3001\u6765\u6e90\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5f80\u5f80\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4e5f\u6a21\u7cca\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u7279\u6027\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "ODA \u5e73\u53f0\u5305\u542b\u56db\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a1) \u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3-\u8bc4\u4f30\u6d41\u7a0b\u786e\u4fdd\u516c\u5e73\u6bd4\u8f83\uff1b2) \u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8bc4\u5206\u6846\u67b6\u4ece\u6570\u5341\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\uff1b3) \u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u6570\u636e\u8c31\u7cfb\u63a2\u7d22\u5668\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6765\u6e90\uff1b4) \u5b8c\u5168\u5f00\u6e90\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u5305\u652f\u6301\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u8bc4\u5206\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8d85\u8fc7120\u4e2a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u300122\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3001600\u591a\u6b21\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fd0\u884c\u548c4000\u4e07\u4e2a\u5904\u7406\u6570\u636e\u70b9\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cODA\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u590d\u6742\u6027\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8c31\u7cfb\u8ffd\u8e2a\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u6d41\u884c\u57fa\u51c6\u4e2d\u7684\u5197\u4f59\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed8\u5236\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8c31\u7cfb\u5173\u7cfb\u56fe\u3002", "conclusion": "ODA \u4e0d\u4ec5\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u6392\u884c\u699c\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u66f4\u65e8\u5728\u63a8\u52a8\u4ece\u8bd5\u9519\u5f0f\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u7406\u5411\u6570\u636e\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u79d1\u5b66\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u6570\u636e\u6df7\u5408\u89c4\u5f8b\u548c\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u6218\u7565\u6784\u6210\u94fa\u5e73\u9053\u8def\u3002"}}

RADAR formulates the draft tree generation process as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and employs offline reinforcement learning to train a prediction model, which enables real-time decision on the calls to the draft model, reducing redundant computations and further accelerating inference. Evaluations across three LLMs and four tasks show that RADAR achieves a speedup of 3.17x-4.82x over the auto-regressive decoding baseline.

A hybrid TCN-Transformer architecture (14.2M parameters) captures local temporal patterns and long-range dependencies, while hierarchical normalization handles six orders of magnitude in discharge. On held-out synthetic tests comprising 799 stations with 18 expert-validated anomaly types, HydroGEM achieves F1 = 0.792 for detection and 68.7% reconstruction-error reduction, a 36.3% improvement over existing methods. Zero-shot transfer to 100 Environment and Climate Change Canada stations yields F1 = 0.586, exceeding all baselines and demonstrating cross-national generalization.

Traditional methods and even state-of-the-art LLMs struggle with benchmarks like the Vending Machine Test, failing to handle SCM's complex continuous time-series data.

However, they still struggle with complex tasks that necessitate dynamic and iterative focusing on fine-grained visual regions to achieve precise grounding and diagnosis. We introduce Ophiuchus, a versatile, tool-augmented framework that equips an MLLM to (i) decide when additional visual evidence is needed, (ii) determine where to probe and ground within the medical image, and (iii) seamlessly weave the relevant sub-image content back into an interleaved, multimodal chain of thought. In contrast to prior approaches limited by the performance ceiling of specialized tools, Ophiuchus integrates the model's inherent grounding and perception capabilities with external tools, thereby fostering higher-level reasoning. The core of our method is a three-stage training strategy: cold-start training with tool-integrated reasoning data to achieve basic tool selection and adaptation for inspecting key regions; self-reflection fine-tuning to strengthen reflective reasoning and encourage revisiting tool outputs; and Agentic Tool Reinforcement Learning to directly optimize task-specific rewards and emulate expert-like diagnostic behavior. Extensive experiments show that Ophiuchus consistently outperforms both closed-source and open-source SOTA methods across diverse medical benchmarks, including VQA, detection, and reasoning-based segmentation.

However, many location descriptions specify positions relatively with spatial relationships, making geocoding based solely on place names or geo-indicative words inaccurate. This issue frequently arises in biological specimen collection records, where locations are often described through narratives rather than coordinates if they pre-date GPS. Accurate georeferencing is vital for biodiversity studies, yet the process remains labour-intensive, leading to a demand for automated georeferencing solutions. This paper explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to georeference complex locality descriptions automatically, focusing on the biodiversity collections domain. We first identified effective prompting patterns, then fine-tuned an LLM using Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA) on biodiversity datasets from multiple regions and languages. Our approach outperforms existing baselines with an average, across datasets, of 65% of records within a 10 km radius, for a fixed amount of training data.

The primary objective is to determine whether LLMs alone can create comprehensive ontologies and, if not, whether human-LLM collaboration can achieve this goal. Consequently, the paper assesses the effectiveness of LLMs in automated ontology development and the enhancement achieved through human-LLM collaboration.\n  Initial ontology generation was performed using One Shot (OS) and Chain of Thought (CoT) prompts, demonstrating the capability of LLMs to autonomously construct ontologies for PD monitoring and alerting. However, these outputs were not comprehensive and required substantial human refinement to enhance their completeness and accuracy.\n  X-HCOME, a hybrid ontology engineering approach that combines human expertise with LLM capabilities, showed significant improvements in ontology comprehensiveness. This methodology resulted in ontologies that are very similar to those constructed by experts.\n  Further experimentation with SimX-HCOME+, another hybrid methodology emphasizing continuous human supervision and iterative refinement, highlighted the importance of ongoing human involvement.

TiCard learns multiplicative residual corrections using EXPLAIN-only features, and uses EXPLAIN ANALYZE only for offline labels. We study two practical instantiations: (i) a Gradient Boosting Regressor for sub-millisecond inference, and (ii) TabPFN, an in-context tabular foundation model that adapts by refreshing a small reference set without gradient retraining. On TiDB with TPCH and the Join Order Benchmark, in a low-trace setting (263 executions total; 157 used for learning), TiCard improves operator-level tail accuracy substantially: P90 Q-error drops from 312.85 (native) to 13.69 (TiCard-GBR), and P99 drops from 37,974.37 to 3,416.50 (TiCard-TabPFN), while a join-only policy preserves near-perfect median behavior.

This paper proposes a Massive editing approach for LLMs based on dynamic weight Generation (MeG). Our MeG involves attaching a dynamic weight neuron to specific layers of the LLMs and using a diffusion model to conditionally generate the weights of this neuron based on the input query required for the knowledge. This allows the use of adding a single dynamic weight neuron to achieve the goal of large-scale knowledge editing.

However, their widespread commercialization is hindered due to their low transferability across diverse terminals. This transferability challenge stems from three limitations: high reliance on port operational specialists, a high demand for terminal-specific data, and time-consuming manual deployment processes. Leveraging the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs), this paper proposes PortAgent, an LLM-driven vehicle dispatching agent that fully automates the VDS transferring workflow. It bears three features: (1) no need for port operations specialists; (2) low need of data; and (3) fast deployment. Specifically, specialist dependency is eliminated by the Virtual Expert Team (VET). The VET collaborates with four virtual experts, including a Knowledge Retriever, Modeler, Coder, and Debugger, to emulate a human expert team for the VDS transferring workflow. These experts specialize in the domain of terminal VDS via a few-shot example learning approach. Through this approach, the experts are able to learn VDS-domain knowledge from a few VDS examples.

We introduce the first Model Context Protocol (MCP) server suite for SPECFEM (supporting 2D, 3D Cartesian, and 3D Globe versions), which decomposes the entire simulation process into discrete, agent-executable tools spanning from parameter generation and mesh partitioning to solver execution and visualization. This approach enables a paradigm shift from file-driven to intent-driven conversational interactions. The framework supports both fully automated execution and human-in-the-loop collaboration, allowing researchers to guide simulation strategies in real time and retain scientific decision-making authority while significantly reducing tedious low-level operations. Validated through multiple case studies, the workflow operates seamlessly in both autonomous and interactive modes, yielding high-fidelity results consistent with standard baselines. As the first application of MCP technology to computational seismology, this study significantly lowers the entry barrier, enhances reproducibility, and offers a promising avenue for advancing computational geophysics toward AI-assisted and automated scientific research.

Including too few passages may omit critical information, while including too many can introduce noise and reduce the quality of the answer. Traditional approaches, such as fixed Top-$K$ retrieval and single-stage reranking, face the dilemma of selecting the right number of passages. This problem is particularly pronounced for factoid questions, which often require only a few specific pieces of evidence. To address this issue, we introduce \\emph{Context-Picker}, a reasoning-aware framework that shifts the paradigm from similarity-based ranking to minimal sufficient subset selection. Context-Picker treats context selection as a decision-making process optimized via a human-inspired, two-stage reinforcement learning schedule: a \\emph{recall-oriented} stage that prioritizes the coverage of reasoning chains, followed by a \\emph{precision-oriented} stage that aggressively prunes redundancy to distill a compact evidence set. To resolve reward sparsity, we propose an offline evidence distillation pipeline that mines \"minimal sufficient sets\" via a Leave-One-Out (LOO) procedure, providing dense, task-aligned supervision. Experiments on five long-context and multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that Context-Picker significantly outperforms strong RAG baselines, achieving superior answer accuracy with comparable or reduced context lengths. Ablation studies indicate that the coarse-to-fine optimization schedule, the redundancy-aware reward shaping, and the rationale-guided format all contribute substantially to these gains.", "AI": {"tldr": "Context-Picker\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9009\u62e9\u4ece\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u6392\u5e8f\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u6700\u5c0f\u5145\u5206\u5b50\u96c6\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587QA\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u751f\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u95ee\u7b54\u4e2d\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u67e5\u8be2\u6240\u9700\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u91cf\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u56fa\u5b9aTop-K\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u5355\u9636\u6bb5\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\uff09\u9762\u4e34\u9009\u62e9\u9002\u5f53\u6bb5\u843d\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u56f0\u5883\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u53ea\u9700\u8981\u5c11\u91cf\u7279\u5b9a\u8bc1\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faContext-Picker\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9009\u62e9\u89c6\u4e3a\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\uff1a\u53ec\u56de\u5bfc\u5411\u9636\u6bb5\u4f18\u5148\u8986\u76d6\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\uff0c\u7cbe\u786e\u5bfc\u5411\u9636\u6bb5\u79ef\u6781\u526a\u679d\u5197\u4f59\u4ee5\u63d0\u70bc\u7d27\u51d1\u8bc1\u636e\u96c6\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u79bb\u7ebf\u8bc1\u636e\u84b8\u998f\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7559\u4e00\u6cd5\u6316\u6398\"\u6700\u5c0f\u5145\u5206\u96c6\"\u63d0\u4f9b\u5bc6\u96c6\u76d1\u7763\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548c\u591a\u8df3QA\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cContext-Picker\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5927\u7684RAG\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5728\u53ef\u6bd4\u6216\u51cf\u5c11\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7c97\u5230\u7ec6\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u8c03\u5ea6\u3001\u5197\u4f59\u611f\u77e5\u5956\u52b1\u5851\u9020\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u5f15\u5bfc\u683c\u5f0f\u90fd\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "conclusion": "Context-Picker\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9009\u62e9\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u6700\u5c0f\u5145\u5206\u5b50\u96c6\u9009\u62e9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u4eba\u7c7b\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587QA\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u91cf\u9009\u62e9\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u3001\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u751f\u6210\u3002"}}

Existing strategies such as Chain-of-Thought and ReAct rely on implicit state tracking and lack an explicit problem representation. Inspired by classical AI planning, we propose Model-First Reasoning (MFR), a two-phase paradigm in which the LLM first constructs an explicit model of the problem, defining entities, state variables, actions, and constraints, before generating a solution plan. Across multiple planning domains, including medical scheduling, route planning, resource allocation, logic puzzles, and procedural synthesis, MFR reduces constraint violations and improves solution quality compared to Chain-of-Thought and ReAct.
