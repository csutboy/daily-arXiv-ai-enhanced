The vehicle is modelled as a three-degree-of-freedom\nmodel where the vehicle is suspended via two identical electromagnetic\nactuators from a rigid support that oscillates. The governing equations are\nderived using force and torque balances, incorporating nonlinear\nelectromagnetic forces, and Kirchhoffs law for the electromagnets with PD\ncontrol strategy on the airgap. The equations of motion are linearized around\nthe steady state induced by the surface oscillation, yielding a system with\ntime-periodic coefficients.

An example in Alzheimer's disease area", "comment": null, "summary": "Background: Clinical trials are designed to prove the efficacy of an\nintervention by means of model-based approaches involving parametric hypothesis\ntesting. Issues arise when no effect is observed in the study population.\nIndeed, an effect may be present in a subgroup and the statistical test cannot\ndetect it. To investigate this possibility, we proposed to change the paradigm\nto a data-driven approach. We selected exploratory methods to provide another\nperspective on the data and to identify particular homogeneous subgroups of\nsubjects within which an effect might be detected. In the setting of prevention\ntrials, the endpoint is a trajectory of repeated measures. In the settings of\nprevention trials, the endpoint is a trajectory of repeated measures, which\nrequires the use of methods that can take data autocorrelation into account.\nThe primary aim of this work was to explore the applicability of different\nmethods for clustering and classifying trajectories. Methods: The Multidomain\nAlzheimer Preventive Trial (MAPT) was a three-year randomized controlled trial\nwith four parallel arms (NCT00672685). The primary outcome was a composite\nZ-score combining four cognitive tests. The data were analyzed by quadratic\nmixed effects model. This study was inconclusive. Exploratory analysis is\ntherefore relevant to investigate the use of data-driven methods for trajectory\nclassification. The methods used were unsupervised: k-means for longitudinal\ndata, Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA), graphic semiology, and supervised\nanalysis with dichotomous classification according to responder status.\nResults: Using k-means for longitudinal data, three groups were obtained and\none of these groups showed cognitive decline over the three years of follow-up.\nThis method could be applied directly to the primary outcome, the composite\nZ-score with repeated observations over time. With the two others unsupervised\nmethods, we were unable to process longitudinal data directly. It was therefore\nnecessary to choose an indicator of change in trajectories and to consider the\nrate of change between two measurements. For the HCA method, Ward's aggregation\nwas performed. The Euclidean distance and rates of change were applied for the\ngraphic semiology method. Lastly, as there were no objective criteria to define\nresponder status, we defined our responders based on clinical criteria.\nDiscussion: In the princeps study, the prevention trial was found to be\ninconclusive, likely due to the heterogeneity of the population, which may have\nmasked a treatment effect later identified in a refined subgroup of high Beta\nAmyloid subjects. So, we have adopted an alternative unsupervised approach to\nsubject stratification based on their trajectories. We could then identify\npatterns of similar trajectories of cognitive decline and also highlight the\npotential problem of a large heterogeneity of the profiles, maybe due to the\nfinal endpoint considered."}

Rather than determining truth or falsity, the Suite operates through\ntwenty diagnostic lenses, applied by practitioners as context warrants, to\nreveal patterns such as confidence laundering, narrative compression, displaced\nauthority, and temporal drift. It is grounded in three design principles:\ndiagnosing production before evaluating claims, preferring diagnostic traction\nover foundational settlement, and embedding reflexivity as a structural\nrequirement rather than an ethical ornament. When enacted, the Suite shifts\nlanguage models into a diagnostic stance, producing inspectable\nartifacts-flags, annotations, contradiction maps, and suspension logs (the FACS\nbundle)-that create an intermediary layer between AI output and human judgment.\nA key innovation is epistemic suspension, a practitioner-enacted circuit\nbreaker that halts continuation when warrant is exceeded, with resumption based\non judgment rather than rule. The methodology also includes an Epistemic Triage\nProtocol and a Meta-Governance Layer to manage proportionality and link\nactivation to relational accountability, consent, historical context, and\npluralism safeguards. Unlike internalist approaches that embed alignment into\nmodel architectures (e.g., RLHF or epistemic-integrity proposals), the Suite\noperates externally as scaffolding, preserving expendability and refusal as\nsafeguards rather than failures.

However, they strictly enforce state constraints as\ninviolable, which can result in overly conservative or infeasible solutions in\ncomplex operational scenarios. Many constraints encountered in practice, such\nas bounds on battery state of charge in electric vehicles, recommended speed\nenvelopes, and comfort constraints in passenger-carrying vehicles, are\ninherently soft. Soft constraints allow temporary violations within predefined\nsafety margins to accommodate uncertainty and competing operational demands,\nalbeit at a cost such as increased wear or higher operational expenses. This\npaper introduces a novel soft-constrained reachability framework that extends\nHamilton-Jacobi reachability analysis for the formal verification of\nsafety-critical systems subject to both hard and soft constraints.\nSpecifically, the framework characterizes a subset of the state space, referred\nto as the soft-constrained reach-avoid set, from which the system is guaranteed\nto reach a desired set safely, under worst-case disturbances, while ensuring\nthat cumulative soft-constraint violations remain within a user-specified\nbudget.

However, they strictly enforce state constraints as\ninviolable, which can result in overly conservative or infeasible solutions in\ncomplex operational scenarios. Many constraints encountered in practice, such\nas bounds on battery state of charge in electric vehicles, recommended speed\nenvelopes, and comfort constraints in passenger-carrying vehicles, are\ninherently soft. Soft constraints allow temporary violations within predefined\nsafety margins to accommodate uncertainty and competing operational demands,\nalbeit at a cost such as increased wear or higher operational expenses. This\npaper introduces a novel soft-constrained reachability framework that extends\nHamilton-Jacobi reachability analysis for the formal verification of\nsafety-critical systems subject to both hard and soft constraints.\nSpecifically, the framework characterizes a subset of the state space, referred\nto as the soft-constrained reach-avoid set, from which the system is guaranteed\nto reach a desired set safely, under worst-case disturbances, while ensuring\nthat cumulative soft-constraint violations remain within a user-specified\nbudget. The framework comprises two principal components: (i) an\naugmented-state model with an auxiliary budget state that tracks\nsoft-constraint violations, and (ii) a regularization-based approximation of\nthe discontinuous Hamilton-Jacobi value function associated with the\nreach-avoid differential game studied herein. The effectiveness of the proposed\nframework is demonstrated through numerical examples involving the landing of a\nsimple point-mass model and a fixed-wing aircraft executing an emergency\ndescent, both under wind disturbances.

When visual confidence falls below a\nthreshold, a GRU-based predictor seamlessly extrapolates pose updates from\nrecent motion history. Crucially, the pipeline's final outputs-translation,\nrotation, and scale deltas-are packaged as direct control signals for 30Hz\nimage-based servo loops. Evaluated on handheld video sequences with up to 90%\nocclusion, our system sustains under 2px tracking error, demonstrating the\nrobustness and low-latency precision essential for reliable real-world robot\nvision applications."}

On the Go Abstractions in Upper\nConfidence bounds applied to Trees (OGA-UCT) is the state-of-the-art MCTS\nabstraction algorithm for deterministic environments that builds its\nabstraction using the Abstractions of State-Action Pairs (ASAP) framework,\nwhich aims to detect states and state-action pairs with the same value under\noptimal play by analysing the search graph.

In this paper, we break with the paradigm of grouping\nvalue-equivalent states or state-action pairs and instead group states and\nstate-action pairs with possibly different values as long as the difference\nbetween their values can be inferred.

The paradigm consists of two\nparts: the neural stability descriptor and the sample-augmented iterative\ntraining scheme. The first part, based on system decomposition, constructs the\nobject (such as a stability function or condition) for stability analysis as a\nscalable aggregation of multiple NNs. These NNs remain fixed across varying\npower system structures and parameters, and are repeatedly shared within each\nsystem instance defined by these variations, thereby enabling the\ngeneralization of the neural stability descriptor across a class of power\nsystems. The second part learns the neural stability descriptor by iteratively\ntraining the NNs with sample augmentation, guided by the tailored\nconservativeness-aware loss function. The training set is strategically\nconstructed to promote the descriptor's generalizability, which is\nsystematically evaluated by verification and validation during the training\nprocess.

To determine whether\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) can identify potential underlying factors and\navenues for intervention, we performed topic-aware hierarchical summarization\nof narratives from African American (AA) storytellers. Fifty transcribed\nstories of AA experiences were used to identify topics in their experience\nusing the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) technique. Stories about a given\ntopic were summarized using an open-source LLM-based hierarchical summarization\napproach. Topic summaries were generated by summarizing across story summaries\nfor each story that addressed a given topic. Generated topic summaries were\nrated for fabrication, accuracy, comprehensiveness, and usefulness by the GPT4\nmodel, and the model's reliability was validated against the original story\nsummaries by two domain experts. 26 topics were identified in the fifty AA\nstories. The GPT4 ratings suggest that topic summaries were free from\nfabrication, highly accurate, comprehensive, and useful. The reliability of GPT\nratings compared to expert assessments showed moderate to high agreement. Our\napproach identified AA experience-relevant topics such as health behaviors,\ninteractions with medical team members, caregiving and symptom management,\namong others. Such insights could help researchers identify potential factors\nand interventions by learning from unstructured narratives in an efficient\nmanner-leveraging the communicative power of storytelling.

The complex kinematic relations among the six actuator paths\nconnecting the fixed base to the moving platform further compound the\ndifficulty in establishing a straightforward and efficient calibration method.\nThe authors developed a new forward kinematics-based calibration method using\nDenavit-Hartenberg convention and used the Stewart platform Tiger 66.1\ndeveloped in their lab for experimenting with the photogrammetry-based\ncalibration strategies described in this paper. This system became operational\nupon completion of construction, marking its inaugural use.

Our core innovations include: (1)\nvision-language decoupling that moves conventional early vision and language\ninputs fusion in VLM to late stage, achieving better performance while enabling\ncaching and reduce inference overhead and latency; (2) long-short action\nchunking to ensure smooth, coherent multi-step planning without sacrificing\nreal-time responsiveness; (3) dynamic routing that adaptively assigns\nlightweight or heavy backbones based on task complexity, further optimizing\ninference efficiency. Experimental results on several benchmarks, as well as\nreal-world deployments, demonstrate that NanoVLA achieves up to 52x faster\ninference on edge devices compared to previous state-of-the-art VLA models,\nwith 98% less parameters while maintaining or surpassing their task accuracy\nand generalization. Ablation studies confirm that our decoupling strategy\npreserves cross-task transferability, and the routing module enhances\ncost-performance trade-offs, enabling practical, high-precision robotic\nmanipulation on resource-constrained hardware."}

This\npaper presents a human-automation shared lane-changing control framework that\npreserves driver authority while allowing automated assistance to achieve\nstable maneuvers in the presence of driver's behavioral uncertainty. Human\ndriving behavior is modeled as a Markov jump process with transitions driven by\ntask difficulty, providing a tractable representation of stochastic state\nswitching.

The desired relative positions are\nrealized using a non-cooperative formation controller derived from Lyapunov's\ndirect approach. We then demonstrate the efficacy of this approach for\nmilitary-like costs such as protection and obstacle avoidance. In simulations,\nwe show a formation planner can reduce a single cost by over 75%. When\nminimizing a variety of cost functions simultaneously, using a formation\nplanner with adaptive weights can reduce the cost by 20-40%. Formation planning\nprovides better performance by minimizing a surrogate cost function that\nclosely approximates the original cost function instead of relying on a shape\nabstraction."}

Wind speed forecasts generated using a Random\nForest model are incorporated into a time-coupled OPF to determine baseline\nconverter setpoints in anticipation of wind fluctuations, which are further\nadjusted in real time based on actual operating conditions. An adaptive droop\ncontrol scheme is developed that jointly considers DC voltage and AC frequency\ndeviations. The effectiveness of the proposed control framework is validated\nthrough hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulations, demonstrating its capability to\nensure stable and robust operation of hybrid AC-HVDC systems under high\npenetration of renewable energy."}

Submitted to IEEE International Conference on\n  Communications (ICC) 2026", "summary": "Molecular communication (MC) enables information exchange through the\ntransmission of signaling molecules (SMs) and holds promise for many innovative\napplications. However, most existing MC studies rely on simplified transmitter\n(TX) models that do not account for the physical and biochemical limitations of\nrealistic biological hardware. This work extends previous efforts toward\ndeveloping models for practical MC systems by proposing a more realistic TX\nmodel that incorporates the delay in SM release and TX noise introduced by\nbiological components. Building on this more realistic, functionalized\nvesicle-based TX model, we propose two novel modulation schemes specifically\ndesigned for this TX to mitigate TX-induced memory effects that arise from\ndelayed and imperfectly controllable SM release. The proposed modulation\nschemes enable low-complexity receiver designs by mitigating memory effects\ndirectly at the TX. Numerical evaluations demonstrate that the proposed schemes\nimprove communication reliability under realistic biochemical constraints,\noffering an important step toward physically realizable MC systems."}

However, existing approaches often lack emotional\nunderstanding, adaptive strategies, and the use of therapeutic methods across\nmultiple sessions with long-term memory, leaving them far from real clinical\npractice. To address these critical gaps, we introduce TheraMind, a strategic\nand adaptive agent for longitudinal psychological counseling. The cornerstone\nof TheraMind is a novel dual-loop architecture that decouples the complex\ncounseling process into an Intra-Session Loop for tactical dialogue management\nand a Cross-Session Loop for strategic therapeutic planning. The Intra-Session\nLoop perceives the patient's emotional state to dynamically select response\nstrategies while leveraging cross-session memory to ensure continuity.\nCrucially, the Cross-Session Loop empowers the agent with long-term\nadaptability by evaluating the efficacy of the applied therapy after each\nsession and adjusting the method for subsequent interactions. We validate our\napproach in a high-fidelity simulation environment grounded in real clinical\ncases. Extensive evaluations show that TheraMind outperforms other methods,\nespecially on multi-session metrics like Coherence, Flexibility, and\nTherapeutic Attunement, validating the effectiveness of its dual-loop design in\nemulating strategic, adaptive, and longitudinal therapeutic behavior.
