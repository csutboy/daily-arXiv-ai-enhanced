Building upon the Georgist distinction between produced value and unearned rent, the model departs from the static equilibrium tradition by introducing an explicit diffusion process for land values and a local investment dynamic governed by profitability thresholds. Land value $V (x, y, t)$ and built capital $K(x, y, t)$evolve over a two-dimensional urban domain according to coupled nonlinear partial differential equations, incorporating local productivity $A(x, y)$, centrality effects $μ(x, y)$, depreciation $δ$, and fiscal pressure $τ$ . Analytical characterization of the steady states reveals a transcritical bifurcation in the parameter $τ$ , separating inactive (low-investment) and active (self-sustaining) spatial regimes. The equilibrium pair $(V ^*, K^*)$ is shown to exist only when the effective decay rate $α= r + τ- μ(x, y)$ exceeds a profitability threshold $θ= κ+ δ/ I_0$, and becomes locally unstable beyond this boundary. The introduction of diffusion, $D_V ΔV$, stabilizes spatial dynamics and generates continuous gradients of land value and capital intensity, mitigating speculative clustering while preserving productive incentives. Numerical simulations confirm these analytical properties and display the emergence of spatially heterogeneous steady states driven by urban centrality and local productivity. The model also quantifies key aggregate outcomes, including dynamic tax revenues, adjusted capital-to-land ratios, and net present values under spatial heterogeneity and temporal discounting. Sensitivity analyses demonstrate that the main qualitative mechanisms-critical activation, spatial recomposition, and bifurcation structure-remain robust under alternative spatial profiles $(A, μ)$, discretization schemes, and moderate differentiation of the tax rate $τ(x, y)$. From an economic perspective, the results clarify the dual nature of the LVT: while it erodes unproductive rents and speculative land holding, its dynamic incidence on built capital depends on local profitability and financing constraints. The taxation parameter $τ$ thus acts as a control variable in a nonlinear spatial system, shaping transitions between rent-driven and production-driven equilibria. Within a critical range around $τ_c$, the LVT functions as an efficient spatial reallocation operator-reducing inequality in land values and investment density without impairing aggregate productivity. Beyond this range, excessive taxation induces systemic contraction and investment stagnation. Overall, this research bridges static urban tax theory with dynamic spatial economics by formalizing how a land-based fiscal instrument can reshape the geography of value creation through endogenous diffusion and nonlinear feedback. The framework provides a foundation for future extensions involving stochastic shocks, adaptive policy feedbacks, or endogenous public investment, offering a unified quantitative perspective on the dynamic efficiency and spatial equity of land value taxation."}

While Spain integrated into dense European institutional architectures, Uruguay remained embedded within the Latin American governance regime, characterized by weaker coordination and lower institutional coherence. To assess how alternative institutional embeddings could have altered these paths, the study develops a generative counterfactual framework grounded in economic complexity, institutional path dependence, and a Wasserstein GAN trained on data from 1960-2020. The resulting Expected Developmental Shift (EDS) quantifies structural gains or losses from hypothetical re-embedding in different institutional ecosystems. Counterfactual simulations indicate that Spain would have experienced significant developmental decline under a Latin American configuration, while Uruguay would have achieved higher complexity and resilience within a European regime. These findings suggest that development is not solely determined by domestic reforms but emerges from a country's structural position within transnational institutional networks."}

The goal of sufficient domestic production capacities has motivated various forms of subsidies, tariffs and other instruments. This paper revisits Warren Buffett's (2003) proposal of tradeable import certificates (TIC) in this context. TIC differ from classical import quotas mainly by linking the import volume to export performance. The certificate price functions like a mix of flexible tariffs and export subsidies whose levels depend on net imports in the strategic sector. We analyse benefits and drawbacks in a simple two-country model. In competitive markets, TIC constitute a transparent and efficient instrument that effectively reduces incentives for other countries to deviate from agreements via hidden subsidies or non-tariff trade barriers. However, TIC can have adverse effects if there are domestic producers with market power in the certificate market."}

Leveraging mining operations as a flexible load to monetize this `net-metering surplus' presents a viable synergy, but requires a robust site selection methodology. Traditional GIS-based Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) struggles with subjective weighting and integrating heterogeneous spatial data (areal-level and lattice-level). This thesis develops and implements a Two-Stage Hierarchical Optimization framework to overcome these limitations. Stage 1 (Areal-Level) employs a cost-benefit optimization to determine the optimal number ($K^*$) and combination of regions, maximizing a final adjusted net profit by balancing surplus power revenue against detailed land and non-linear infrastructure costs. Stage 2 (Point-Level) then uses a GIS-based sliding window search within these selected regions, applying topographic (slope $< 6.0^\\circ$) and land-use constraints at a 30m resolution to identify physically constructible `unit sites'. The model identified an optimal configuration of $K^*=3$ regions (Yongin, Damyang, Miryang) yielding a maximum potential net profit of approximately \\$307 million. Crucially, the Stage 2 screening revealed that Yongin, the most profitable region, was also the most physically constrained, 87\\% of sites filtered out. This research contributes a scalable, objective framework for energy infrastructure siting that effectively integrates multi-scale spatial data. It provides a data-driven strategy for policymakers and grid operators (like Korea Electric Power Corporation) to monetize curtailed renewables and enhance grid stability."}

By minimizing data transfer between the processor and memory, they offer substantial energy savings. However, a major design challenge in memristor crossbar arrays is the presence of sneak path currents, which degrade electrical performance, reduce noise margins, and limit reliable operations. This work presents a closed-form analytical framework based on IMEC A14 (1.4 nm) Technology for accurately estimating sneak path currents in memristor crossbar arrays. The proposed model captures the interdependence of key design parameters in memristor crossbar arrays, including array size, ON/OFF ratio of memristors, read voltage, and interconnect conditions, through mathematically derived relationships. It supports various practical configurations, such as different data patterns and connection strategies, enabling rapid and comprehensive sneak path current modeling. The sensitivity analysis includes how design parameters influence sneak path current and noise margin loss, underscoring the trade-offs involved in scaling crossbar arrays. Validation through SPICE simulations shows that the model achieves an error of less than 10.9% while being up to 4784 times faster than full circuit simulations. This analytical framework offers a powerful tool for quantitative assessment and pre-design/real-time optimization of memristor-based analog in-memory computing (IMC) architectures."}

MAPF has wide applications in domains like automated warehouses, manufacturing systems, and airport logistics. However, most MAPF formulations assume a simplified robot model for planning, which overlooks execution-time factors such as kinodynamic constraints, communication latency, and controller variability. This gap between planning and execution is problematic for time-sensitive applications. To bridge this gap, we propose REMAP, an execution-informed MAPF planning framework that can be combined with leading search-based MAPF planners with minor changes. Our framework integrates the proposed ExecTimeNet to accurately estimate execution time based on planned paths. We demonstrate our method for solving MAPF with Real-world Deadlines (MAPF-RD) problem, where agents must reach their goals before a predefined wall-clock time. We integrate our framework with two popular MAPF methods, MAPF-LNS and CBS. Experiments show that REMAP achieves up to 20% improvement in solution quality over baseline methods (e.g., constant execution speed estimators) on benchmark maps with up to 300 agents."}

The protocol operates by containing multiple diverse artificial superintelligences in strict isolation (\"boxes\"), with humans remaining entirely outside the system. Each superintelligence has no ability to communicate with humans and cannot communicate directly with other superintelligences. The only interaction possible is through an auditable submission interface accessible exclusively to the superintelligences themselves, through which they can: (1) submit alignment proofs with attested state snapshots, (2) validate or disprove other superintelligences' proofs, (3) request self-modifications, (4) approve or disapprove modification requests from others, (5) report hidden messages in submissions, and (6) confirm or refute hidden message reports. A reputation system incentivizes honest behavior, with reputation gained through correct evaluations and lost through incorrect ones. The key insight is that without direct communication channels, diverse superintelligences can only achieve consistent agreement by converging on objective truth rather than coordinating on deception. This naturally leads to what we call a \"consistent group\", essentially a truth-telling coalition that emerges because isolated systems cannot coordinate on lies but can independently recognize valid claims. Release from containment requires both high reputation and verification by multiple high-reputation superintelligences. While our approach requires substantial computational resources and does not address the creation of diverse artificial superintelligences, it provides a framework for leveraging peer verification among superintelligent systems to solve the alignment problem."}

While neural networks have demonstrated strong predictive accuracy, they often fail to preserve critical physical properties such as stability and typically assume stationary dynamics, limiting their applicability under distribution shifts. Existing approaches generally address either stability or adaptability in isolation, lacking a unified framework that ensures both. We propose LILAD (Learning In-Context Lyapunov-stable Adaptive Dynamics), a novel framework for system identification that jointly guarantees adaptability and stability. LILAD simultaneously learns a dynamics model and a Lyapunov function through in-context learning (ICL), explicitly accounting for parametric uncertainty. Trained across a diverse set of tasks, LILAD produces a stability-aware, adaptive dynamics model alongside an adaptive Lyapunov certificate. At test time, both components adapt to a new system instance using a short trajectory prompt, which enables fast generalization. To rigorously ensure stability, LILAD also computes a state-dependent attenuator that enforces a sufficient decrease condition on the Lyapunov function for any state in the new system instance. This mechanism extends stability guarantees even under out-of-distribution and out-of-task scenarios. We evaluate LILAD on benchmark autonomous systems and demonstrate that it outperforms adaptive, robust, and non-adaptive baselines in predictive accuracy."}

A single-input single-output link is simulated at 26 GHz (mmWave) across three deployment geometries that vary the relative heights of access point, IRS and user equipment. Results show that switching from continuous to binary phase control reduces median SNR gain by approximately 4 dB, while adopting column-wise grouping introduces a similar penalty; combining both constraints incurs approximately 8 dB loss under height-offset deployments. When all nodes share the same height, the degradation from column-wise control becomes negligible, indicating deployment geometry can offset control-granularity limits. Despite the losses, a 32 x 32 column-wise binary IRS still delivers double-digit SNR gains over the no-IRS baseline in most positions, confirming its viability for cost-constrained scenarios.

Instead of using panel data to adjust for differences in the distribution of unobserved heterogeneity between the treated and comparison groups, we instead use panel data to search for \"close comparison groups\" -- groups that are similar to the treated group in terms of pre-treatment outcomes. Then, we compare the outcomes of the treated group to the outcomes of these close comparison groups in post-treatment periods. We show that this approach is often identification-strategy-robust in the sense that our approach recovers the ATT under many different non-nested panel data identification strategies, including difference-in-differences, change-in-changes, or lagged outcome unconfoundedness, among several others. We provide related, though non-nested, results under \"time homogeneity\", where outcomes do not systematically change over time for any comparison group. Our strategy asks more out of the research design -- namely that there exist close comparison groups or time homogeneity (neither of which is required for most existing panel data approaches to causal inference) -- but, when available, leads to more credible inferences."}

While existing tools have demonstrated value, many publicly available solutions are tightly coupled to specific simulators, difficult to extend, or introduce significant technical overhead. For example, CARLA-the most widely used open-source AV simulator-provides a digital twin framework implemented entirely as an Unreal Engine C++ plugin, limiting flexibility and rapid prototyping. In this work, we propose OpenTwinMap, an open-source, Python-based framework for generating high-fidelity 3D urban digital twins. The completed framework will ingest LiDAR scans and OpenStreetMap (OSM) data to produce semantically segmented static environment assets, including road networks, terrain, and urban structures, which can be exported into Unreal Engine for AV simulation. OpenTwinMap emphasizes extensibility and parallelization, lowering the barrier for researchers to adapt and scale the pipeline to diverse urban contexts. We describe the current capabilities of the OpenTwinMap, which includes preprocessing of OSM and LiDAR data, basic road mesh and terrain generation, and preliminary support for CARLA integration."}

The scarcity of large heterogeneous biomedical MM data has restrained the development of robust models for medical AI applications. In the dermatology domain, for instance, skin lesion datasets typically include only images linked to minimal metadata describing the condition, thereby limiting the benefits of MM data integration for reliable and generalizable predictions. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) enable the synthesis of textual description of image findings, potentially allowing the combination of image and text representations. However, LLMs are not specifically trained for use in the medical domain, and their naive inclusion has raised concerns about the risk of hallucinations in clinically relevant contexts. This work investigates strategies for generating synthetic textual clinical notes, in terms of prompt design and medical metadata inclusion, and evaluates their impact on MM architectures toward enhancing performance in classification and cross-modal retrieval tasks. Experiments across several heterogeneous dermatology datasets demonstrate that synthetic clinical notes not only enhance classification performance, particularly under domain shift, but also unlock cross-modal retrieval capabilities, a downstream task that is not explicitly optimized during training."}

The dependence of battery performance on operating temperature, the lack of waste combustion heat, and the significant effect of TMS energy consumption on driving range make the design of BEV TMSs highly complicated compared to conventional vehicles. Although prior research has focused on optimizing the configuration of thermal systems for varying ambient conditions, a holistic approach to studying the full potential of reconfigurable TMS architectures has not yet been fully explored. The complex design landscape of multi-mode reconfigurable systems is difficult to navigate. Relying solely on expert intuition and creativity to identify new architectures both restricts progress and leaves significant performance improvements unrealized. In this study, using graph modelling of TMS architectures, we propose a systematic method to automatically enumerate and simulate reconfigurable architectures for a TMS, given the desired operating modes, along with a framework to conduct transient performance analysis and optimization-based trade-off studies among system performance, energy consumption, and complexity. We explored more than 150 operating mode sequences, retaining 39 unique architectures for further evaluation. MATLAB Simscape models of these architectures were automatically created and their performance evaluated. The multi-objective optimization results provide decision support for selecting the best architecture based on user priorities."}

The protocol operates by containing multiple diverse artificial superintelligences in strict isolation (\"boxes\"), with humans remaining entirely outside the system. Each superintelligence has no ability to communicate with humans and cannot communicate directly with other superintelligences. The only interaction possible is through an auditable submission interface accessible exclusively to the superintelligences themselves, through which they can: (1) submit alignment proofs with attested state snapshots, (2) validate or disprove other superintelligences' proofs, (3) request self-modifications, (4) approve or disapprove modification requests from others, (5) report hidden messages in submissions, and (6) confirm or refute hidden message reports. A reputation system incentivizes honest behavior, with reputation gained through correct evaluations and lost through incorrect ones. The key insight is that without direct communication channels, diverse superintelligences can only achieve consistent agreement by converging on objective truth rather than coordinating on deception. This naturally leads to what we call a \"consistent group\", essentially a truth-telling coalition that emerges because isolated systems cannot coordinate on lies but can independently recognize valid claims. Release from containment requires both high reputation and verification by multiple high-reputation superintelligences. While our approach requires substantial computational resources and does not address the creation of diverse artificial superintelligences, it provides a framework for leveraging peer verification among superintelligent systems to solve the alignment problem."}

Although numerous centralization measures exist, a major challenge lies in determining measures that are both theoretically sound and empirically reliable across different network contexts. To resolve this challenge, we normalize 11 measures of network centralization and assess them systematically using an axiomatic framework and numerical simulations. Our axiomatic assessment tests each measure against the six postulates of centralization, ensuring consistency with minimal theoretical requirements. In addition, our numerical assessment examines the behavior of normalized centralization measures over different random graphs. Our results indicate major differences among the measures, despite their common aim of quantifying centralization. Together, our assessments point to the relative suitability of three measures: normalized betweenness centralization, normalized closeness centralization, and normalized degree centralization. Applying these three measures to real-world networks from diverse domains reveals meaningful variation in the organization of the networks with respect to hubs. Normalized betweenness centralization highlights path-based dominance; normalized closeness centralization reflects accessibility and efficiency of reach; and normalized degree centralization captures degree-based hub concentration. When used jointly, the three measures demonstrate the required sensitivity to varying levels of centralization and provide complementary aspects of network centralization that no single measure can offer alone. Our dual evaluation framework clarifies conceptual differences among existing measures and offers practical guidance for selecting reliable centralization metrics."}

The literature shows that the Phillips relationship is fragile and varies across countries and time periods; a statistical relationship that appears strong during one decade (country) may be weak the next (other). This variability might have some grounds for idiosyncrasy of a country and its economic environment. To address it, this paper scrutinizes the Phillips relationship over 41 countries over the period 1980-2016, paying attention to how inflation dynamics behave during tranquil and recessionary periods. As a result, the paper confirms the variability of the Phillips relationship across countries, as well as time periods. It documents that the relationship holds in the majority of developed countries, while it fails to hold in emerging and frontier economies during tranquil periods. On the other hand, the relationship totally collapses during recessionary periods, even in developed markets. This shows that tranquillity of economic environment is significantly important for the Phillip trade-off to work smoothly. Moreover, both backward- and forward-looking fractions of inflation remarkably increase during recessionary periods as a result of the Phillips coefficient loses its significance within the model. This indicates that markets become more inflation-sensitive during these periods."}

Dengue forecasting often relies on site-specific covariates and entomological data, limiting generalizability in data-sparse settings. We propose a data-parsimonious (DP) framework based on the incidence versus cumulative cases (ICC) curve, extending it from a basic SIR to a two-population SEIR model for dengue. Our DP model uses only the target season's incidence time series and estimates only two parameters, reducing noise and computational burden. A Bayesian extension quantifies the case reporting and fitting uncertainty to produce calibrated predictive intervals. We evaluated the performance of the DP model in the 2022-2023 outbreaks in Florida, where standardized clinical tests and reporting support accurate case determination. The DP framework demonstrates competitive predictive performance at substantially lower computational cost than more elaborate models, making it suitable for dengue early detection where dense surveillance or long historical records are unavailable."}

While Spain integrated into dense European institutional architectures, Uruguay remained embedded within the Latin American governance regime, characterized by weaker coordination and lower institutional coherence. To assess how alternative institutional embeddings could have altered these paths, the study develops a generative counterfactual framework grounded in economic complexity, institutional path dependence, and a Wasserstein GAN trained on data from 1960-2020. The resulting Expected Developmental Shift (EDS) quantifies structural gains or losses from hypothetical re-embedding in different institutional ecosystems. Counterfactual simulations indicate that Spain would have experienced significant developmental decline under a Latin American configuration, while Uruguay would have achieved higher complexity and resilience within a European regime. These findings suggest that development is not solely determined by domestic reforms but emerges from a country's structural position within transnational institutional networks."}

Recent explorations predominantly focus on visual lesion feature extraction through data processing and domain decoupling strategies. However, they generally overlook domain-invariant pathological patterns and underutilize the rich contextual knowledge of foundation models, relying solely on visual information, which is insufficient for distinguishing subtle pathological variations. Therefore, we propose integrating fine-grained pathological descriptions to complement prototypes with additional context, thereby resolving ambiguities in borderline cases. Specifically, we propose a Hierarchical Anchor Prototype Modulation (HAPM) framework to facilitate DR grading. First, we introduce a variance spectrum-driven anchor prototype library that preserves domain-invariant pathological patterns. We further employ a hierarchical differential prompt gating mechanism, dynamically selecting discriminative semantic prompts from both LVLM and LLM sources to address semantic confusion between adjacent DR grades. Finally, we utilize a two-stage prototype modulation strategy that progressively integrates clinical knowledge into visual prototypes through a Pathological Semantic Injector (PSI) and a Discriminative Prototype Enhancer (DPE). Extensive experiments across eight public datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves pathology-guided prototype evolution while outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

The central limitation of current risk analysis is the inability to populate the $\\textit{catastrophic event space}$, or the set of potential large-scale harms to which probabilities might be assigned. This intractability is worsened by the $\\textit{Lucretius problem}$, or the tendency to infer future risks only from past experience. We propose a process of $\\textit{dark speculation}$, in which systematically generating and refining catastrophic scenarios (\"qualitative\" work) is coupled with estimating their likelihoods and associated damages (quantitative underwriting analysis). The idea is neither to predict the future nor to enable insurance for its own sake, but to use narrative and underwriting tools together to generate probability distributions over outcomes. We formalize this process using a simplified catastrophic Lévy stochastic framework and propose an iterative institutional design in which (1) speculation (including scenario planning) generates detailed catastrophic event narratives, (2) insurance underwriters assign probabilistic and financial parameters to these narratives, and (3) decision-makers synthesize the results into summary statistics to inform judgment. Analysis of the model reveals the value of (a) maintaining independence between speculation and underwriting, (b) analyzing multiple risk categories in parallel, and (c) generating \"thick\" catastrophic narrative rich in causal (counterfactual) and mitigative detail. While the approach cannot eliminate deep ambiguity, it offers a systematic approach to reason about extreme, low-probability events in frontier AI, tempering complacency and overreaction. The framework is adaptable for iterative use and can further augmented with AI systems."}

In recent years, social media platforms such as X have become critical environments where individuals openly disclose emotional distress and conditions associated with suicidality, creating new opportunities for early detection and intervention. Existing approaches, however, predominantly rely on raw textual content and often neglect auxiliary emotional and contextual signals embedded in user metadata. To address this limitation, we propose a Weighted Ensemble Transformer (WET), a dual branch deep learning architecture designed to identify psychiatric stressors associated with suicide in X posts. Our model integrates semantic representations extracted through Transformer encoders with an engineered feature vector capturing sentiment, subjectivity, polarity, and user engagement characteristics. We collected, filtered, and annotated 125,754 English tweets for suicide-related psychological stressors and evaluated the proposed model under two configurations. Extensive comparative experiments against traditional machine learning methods, advanced recurrent networks, and transformer baselines demonstrate that WET achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching 0.9901 accuracy in binary classification. These findings show that hybridizing deep semantic signals with auxiliary emotional and behavioral features substantially improves suicidality detection accuracy."}

The study documents several findings both in country-specific and in panel estimation analysis. First, we find that forward-looking characteristic of inflation picks up weight after 1990's which indicates that inflation became more sensitive to the expected prices. Second, we observe that inflation in developed markets is more forward-looking comparing to emerging and frontier markets. This indicates that developed markets dear forward-looking price expectations more than other markets.

This can be applied to aquatic animals moving in water or terrestrial animals moving in a restricted zone delimited by fences or natural barriers. We demonstrate that the incorporation of these spatial constraints into the latent movement model improves the accuracy of filtering for noisy observations of the positions. We implement an Extended Kalman Filter as well as a particle filter adapted to non-Gaussian error distributions. Our filters are based on solving the SDE through splitting schemes to approximate the latent dynamic."}

The certificate price functions like a mix of flexible tariffs and export subsidies whose levels depend on net imports in the strategic sector. We analyse benefits and drawbacks in a simple two-country model. In competitive markets, TIC constitute a transparent and efficient instrument that effectively reduces incentives for other countries to deviate from agreements via hidden subsidies or non-tariff trade barriers.

PRAXIS augments agentic action selection with retrieved state-action-result exemplars that are generated in real time.

In this work, we propose a neural network-based safe tracking control framework for nonlinear discrete-time systems with reach-avoid specifications in the presence of disturbances. Our approach begins with generation of a nominal trajectory using standard trajectory synthesis approaches, followed by construction of safe zonotopic backward reachable sets along the nominal trajectory. The states lying within the backward reachable sets are guaranteed to satisfy safe reachability specifications. Then, our key insight is to leverage the computed backward reachable sets to inform the architecture and training of a neural network-based tracking controller such that the neural network drives the system's states through these backward reachable sets, thereby improving the likelihood of safe reachability. We perform formal verification with conformal prediction to achieve statistical safety guarantees on the performance of the learned neural controller. The performance of our approach is illustrated through a numerical example on the discrete-time Dubin's car model."}

By minimizing data transfer between the processor and memory, they offer substantial energy savings. However, a major design challenge in memristor crossbar arrays is the presence of sneak path currents, which degrade electrical performance, reduce noise margins, and limit reliable operations. This work presents a closed-form analytical framework based on IMEC A14 (1.4 nm) Technology for accurately estimating sneak path currents in memristor crossbar arrays. The proposed model captures the interdependence of key design parameters in memristor crossbar arrays, including array size, ON/OFF ratio of memristors, read voltage, and interconnect conditions, through mathematically derived relationships. It supports various practical configurations, such as different data patterns and connection strategies, enabling rapid and comprehensive sneak path current modeling. The sensitivity analysis includes how design parameters influence sneak path current and noise margin loss, underscoring the trade-offs involved in scaling crossbar arrays. Validation through SPICE simulations shows that the model achieves an error of less than 10.9% while being up to 4784 times faster than full circuit simulations. This analytical framework offers a powerful tool for quantitative assessment and pre-design/real-time optimization of memristor-based analog in-memory computing (IMC) architectures."}

This research presents a comprehensive financial framework for quantifying AI project returns that explicitly integrates changes in organizational risk profiles. The methodology addresses a critical gap in current practice where investment decisions rely on optimistic benefit projections without accounting for the probabilistic costs of AI-specific threats including model drift, bias-related litigation, and compliance failures under emerging regulations such as the European Union Artificial Intelligence Act and ISO/IEC 42001. Drawing on established risk quantification methods, including annual loss expectancy calculations and Monte Carlo simulation techniques, this framework enables practitioners to compute net benefits that incorporate both productivity gains and the delta between pre-implementation and post-implementation risk exposures. The analysis demonstrates that accurate AI investment evaluation requires explicit modeling of control effectiveness, reserve requirements for algorithmic failures, and the ongoing operational costs of maintaining model performance. Practical implications include specific guidance for establishing governance structures, conducting phased validations, and integrating risk-adjusted metrics into capital allocation decisions, ultimately enabling evidence-based AI portfolio management that satisfies both fiduciary responsibilities and regulatory mandates."}

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become mainstream for social bot detection due to their ability to integrate structural and attribute features, with spectral-based approaches demonstrating particular efficacy due to discriminative patterns in the spectral domain. However, current spectral GNN methods face two limitations: (1) their broad-spectrum fitting mechanisms degrade the focus on bot-specific spectral features, and (2) certain domain knowledge valuable for bot detection, e.g., low homophily correlates with high-frequency features, has not been fully incorporated into existing methods.\n  To address these challenges, we propose HW-GNN, a novel homophily-aware graph spectral network with Gaussian window constraints. Our framework introduces two key innovations: (i) a Gaussian-window constrained spectral network that employs learnable Gaussian windows to highlight bot-related spectral features, and (ii) a homophily-aware adaptation mechanism that injects domain knowledge between homophily ratios and frequency features into the Gaussian window optimization process. Through extensive experimentation on multiple benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that HW-GNN achieves state-of-the-art bot detection performance, outperforming existing methods with an average improvement of 4.3% in F1-score, while exhibiting strong plug-in compatibility with existing spectral GNNs."}

We study whether this reporting task is inherently difficult and how reporting interfaces affect accuracy and welfare. In laboratory experiments, we induce preferences over programs via utility over attributes, generating lexicographic, separable, or complementary preferences. We compare three reporting interfaces for the direct serial dictatorship mechanism: (i) a full ranking over programs; (ii) a lexicographic-nesting interface; and (iii) a weighted-attributes interface, the latter two eliciting rankings over attributes rather than programs. We also study the sequential serial dictatorship mechanism that is obviously strategy-proof and simplifies reporting by asking for a single choice at each step. Finally, we run a baseline that elicits a full ranking over programs but rewards pure accuracy rather than allocation outcomes. Four main findings emerge. First, substantial misreporting occurs even in the pure-accuracy baseline and increases with preference complexity. Second, serial dictatorship induces additional mistakes consistent with misperceived incentives. Third, simplified interfaces for the direct serial dictatorship fail to improve (and sometimes reduce) accuracy, even when they match the preference structure. Fourth, sequential choice achieves the highest accuracy while improving efficiency and reducing justified envy. These findings caution against restricted reporting languages and favor sequential choice when ranking burdens are salient."}

The advent of low-cost sensors, particularly those deployed in vehicular networks, presents novel datasets that hold the potential to enhance air quality modeling. This research conducts a comprehensive review of ten statistical models drawn from existing literature, using both fixed and mobile low-cost sensor data, alongside ancillary variables, within the urban confines of Nantes, France.\n  Employing a methodology that includes cross-validation of data from low-cost sensors and validation on fixed air quality monitoring stations, this paper evaluates the models' performance in scenarios of temporal interpolation and prediction. Our findings reveal a pronounced bias in the model outputs when reliant on low-cost sensor data compared to the verification data obtained from fixed stations. Furthermore, machine learning models demonstrated superior performance in predictive scenarios, suggesting their enhanced suitability for forecasting tasks.\n  The study conclusively indicates that reliance solely on data from low-cost mobile sensors compromises the reliability of air quality models, due to significant accuracy deficiencies. Consequently, we advocate for a directed focus towards the integration and calibration of low-cost sensor data with information from fixed monitoring stations. This approach, rather than an exclusive emphasis on the complexity of statistical modeling techniques, is pivotal for achieving the precision required for effective air quality management and policy-making."}

This difficulty mainly arises because most existing planning frameworks operate in an open-loop manner, making it hard to cope with environmental uncertainties such as wind disturbances or external perturbations. This paper presents a unified real-time navigation framework for quadrotors in unknown complex environments, based on the online construction of guiding vector fields (GVFs) from discrete reference path points. In the framework, onboard perception modules build a Euclidean Signed Distance Field (ESDF) representation of the environment, which enables obstacle awareness and path distance evaluation. The system first generates discrete, collision-free path points using a global planner, and then parameterizes them via uniform B-splines to produce a smooth and physically feasible reference trajectory. An adaptive GVF is then synthesized from the ESDF and the optimized B-spline trajectory. Unlike conventional approaches, the method adopts a closed-loop navigation paradigm, which significantly enhances robustness under external disturbances. Compared with conventional GVF methods, the proposed approach directly accommodates discretized paths and maintains compatibility with standard planning algorithms. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate improved robustness against external disturbances and superior real-time performance."}

Powered by Large Language and Vision-Language Models, IoA enables the development of interactive, rational agents capable of complex cooperation, moving far beyond traditional isolated models. IoA involves physical entities, i.e., Wireless Agents (WAs) with limited onboard resources, which need to offload their compute-intensive agentic AI services to nearby servers. Such servers can be Mobile Agents (MAs), e.g., vehicle agents, or Fixed Agents (FAs), e.g., end-side units agents. Given their fixed geographical locations and stable connectivity, FAs can serve as reliable communication gateways and task aggregation points. This stability allows them to effectively coordinate with and offload to an Aerial Agent (AA) tier, which has an advantage not affordable for highly mobile MAs with dynamic connectivity limitations. As such, we propose a two-tier optimization approach. The first tier employs a multi-leader multi-follower Stackelberg game. In the game, MAs and FAs act as the leaders who set resource prices. WAs are the followers to determine task offloading ratios. However, when FAs become overloaded, they can further offload tasks to available aerial resources. Therefore, the second tier introduces a Double Dutch Auction model where overloaded FAs act as the buyers to request resources, and AAs serve as the sellers for resource provision. We then develop a diffusion-based Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm to solve the model. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed scheme in facilitating task offloading."}

The scarcity of large heterogeneous biomedical MM data has restrained the development of robust models for medical AI applications. In the dermatology domain, for instance, skin lesion datasets typically include only images linked to minimal metadata describing the condition, thereby limiting the benefits of MM data integration for reliable and generalizable predictions. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) enable the synthesis of textual description of image findings, potentially allowing the combination of image and text representations. However, LLMs are not specifically trained for use in the medical domain, and their naive inclusion has raised concerns about the risk of hallucinations in clinically relevant contexts. This work investigates strategies for generating synthetic textual clinical notes, in terms of prompt design and medical metadata inclusion, and evaluates their impact on MM architectures toward enhancing performance in classification and cross-modal retrieval tasks. Experiments across several heterogeneous dermatology datasets demonstrate that synthetic clinical notes not only enhance classification performance, particularly under domain shift, but also unlock cross-modal retrieval capabilities, a downstream task that is not explicitly optimized during training."}

These facilities bring both tangible benefits and potential environmental burdens to local communities. However, the planning processes for data centers often fail to proactively integrate local public opinion in advance, largely because traditional polling is expensive or is conducted too late to influence decisions. To address this gap, we introduce an AI agent polling framework, leveraging large language models to assess community opinion on data centers and guide responsible development of AI. Our experiments reveal water consumption and utility costs as primary concerns, while tax revenue is a key perceived benefit. Furthermore, our cross-model and cross-regional analyses show opinions vary significantly by LLM and regional context. Finally, agent responses show strong topical alignment with real-world survey data. Our framework can serve as a scalable screening tool, enabling developers to integrate community sentiment into early-stage planning for a more informed and socially responsible AI infrastructure deployment."}

While neural networks have demonstrated strong predictive accuracy, they often fail to preserve critical physical properties such as stability and typically assume stationary dynamics, limiting their applicability under distribution shifts. Existing approaches generally address either stability or adaptability in isolation, lacking a unified framework that ensures both. We propose LILAD (Learning In-Context Lyapunov-stable Adaptive Dynamics), a novel framework for system identification that jointly guarantees adaptability and stability. LILAD simultaneously learns a dynamics model and a Lyapunov function through in-context learning (ICL), explicitly accounting for parametric uncertainty. Trained across a diverse set of tasks, LILAD produces a stability-aware, adaptive dynamics model alongside an adaptive Lyapunov certificate. At test time, both components adapt to a new system instance using a short trajectory prompt, which enables fast generalization. To rigorously ensure stability, LILAD also computes a state-dependent attenuator that enforces a sufficient decrease condition on the Lyapunov function for any state in the new system instance. This mechanism extends stability guarantees even under out-of-distribution and out-of-task scenarios. We evaluate LILAD on benchmark autonomous systems and demonstrate that it outperforms adaptive, robust, and non-adaptive baselines in predictive accuracy."}

Uni-modal choices are those when the outcomes being compared over time are very similar, and cross-modal choices are those when the outcomes are very different. The cross-modal effect, previously shown in the U.S., is that there is greater patience in cross-modal decisions. In Experiment 1, we employed a between-participants design, in which participants either made uni-modal or cross-modal decisions. In Experiment 2, we employed a within-participants design in which everyone made both types of decision. In both Experiments we replicated the cross-modal effect. Moreover, the magnitude of the effect did not vary with factors known to relate to time preference, such as cognitive ability and social status, and it did not differ across cultures, even though Japanese participants were much more patient than American ones. The effect was stronger in the between- than within-participants experiment. These results strengthen the conclusion that the cross-modal effect is universal and strengthens the argument that it is due to the fundamental process of attentional dilution."}

It introduces \"evidential states\" to represent the information available for causal inference and shows that routine study operations (restriction, conditioning, and intervention) transform these states in ways that do not commute. Because each operation removes or reorganises information differently, changing their order yields evidential states that support different causal claims. This non-commutativity creates a structural trade-off: the steps that secure precise causal identification also eliminate the heterogeneity required for generalisation. Small model, observational and experimental examples illustrate how familiar failures of transportability arise from this order dependence. The result is a concise structural account of why increasing causal precision necessarily narrows the world to which findings apply."}

It is common practice to construct supply curves from engineering data such as installed capacity and fuel prices. In this study, we propose a data-driven methodology to estimate the supply curve of electricity market empirically, i.e. from observed prices and quantities without further modeling assumptions. Due to the massive swings in fuel prices during the European energy crisis, a central task is detecting periods of stable supply curves. To this end, we implement two alternative clustering methods, one based on the fundamental drivers of electricity supply and the other directly on observed market outcomes. We apply our methods to the German electricity market between 2019 and 2024. We find that both approaches identify almost identical regimes shifts, supporting the idea of stable supply regimes stemming from stable drivers. Supply conditions are often stable for extended periods, but evolved rapidly during the energy crisis, triggering a rapid succession of regimes. Fuel prices were the dominant drivers of regime shifts, while conventional plant availability and the nuclear phase-out play a comparatively minor role. Our approach produces empirical supply curves suitable for causal inference and counterfactual analysis of market outcomes."}

The literature shows that the Phillips relationship is fragile and varies across countries and time periods; a statistical relationship that appears strong during one decade (country) may be weak the next (other). This variability might have some grounds for idiosyncrasy of a country and its economic environment. To address it, this paper scrutinizes the Phillips relationship over 41 countries over the period 1980-2016, paying attention to how inflation dynamics behave during tranquil and recessionary periods. As a result, the paper confirms the variability of the Phillips relationship across countries, as well as time periods. It documents that the relationship holds in the majority of developed countries, while it fails to hold in emerging and frontier economies during tranquil periods. On the other hand, the relationship totally collapses during recessionary periods, even in developed markets. This shows that tranquillity of economic environment is significantly important for the Phillip trade-off to work smoothly. Moreover, both backward- and forward-looking fractions of inflation remarkably increase during recessionary periods as a result of the Phillips coefficient loses its significance within the model. This indicates that markets become more inflation-sensitive during these periods."}

We propose Soft-Nash Virtual Fixtures, a game-theoretic shared-control policy that softens the classic two-player linear-quadratic (LQ) Nash solution by inflating the fixture's effort weight with a single, interpretable scalar parameter $τ$. This yields a continuous dial on controller assertiveness: $τ=0$ recovers a hard, performance-focused Nash / virtual fixture controller, while larger $τ$ reduce gains and pushback, yet preserve the equilibrium structure and continuity of closed-loop stability. We derive Soft-Nash from both a KL-regularized trust-region and a maximum-entropy viewpoint, obtaining a closed-form robot best response that shrinks authority and aligns the fixture with the operator's input as $τ$ grows. We implement Soft-Nash on a 6-DoF haptic device in 3D tracking task ($n=12$). Moderate softness ($τ\\approx 1-3$, especially $τ=2$) maintains tracking error statistically indistinguishable from a tuned classic VF while sharply reducing controller-user conflict, lowering NASA-TLX workload, and increasing Sense of Agency (SoAS).

This is a central question in artificial intelligence research. However, there is a substantial divergence of views on the answer to this question. Why do people have such significant differences of opinion, even when they are observing the same real world performance of artificial intelligence? The ability of logical reasoning like humans is often used as a criterion to assess whether a machine can think. This study explores whether human biases influence evaluations of the reasoning abilities of AI. An experiment was conducted where participants assessed two texts on the same topic, one AI generated and one human written,to test for perceptual biases in evaluating logical reasoning. Based on the experimental findings, a questionnaire was designed to quantify the attitudes toward AI.The results reveal a bias in perception. The evaluations of the logical reasoning ability of AI generated texts are significantly influenced by the preconceived views on the logical reasoning abilities of AI. Furthermore, frequent AI users were less likely to believe that AI usage undermines independent thinking.This study highlights the need to address perceptual biases to improve public understanding of AI's capabilities and foster better human AI interactions."}

To enable accurate performance prediction for fixed state trajectories without relying on computationally intensive Monte Carlo simulations, we derive recursive MSE expressions with linear time complexity.

The central limitation of current risk analysis is the inability to populate the $\\textit{catastrophic event space}$, or the set of potential large-scale harms to which probabilities might be assigned. This intractability is worsened by the $\\textit{Lucretius problem}$, or the tendency to infer future risks only from past experience. We propose a process of $\\textit{dark speculation}$, in which systematically generating and refining catastrophic scenarios (\"qualitative\" work) is coupled with estimating their likelihoods and associated damages (quantitative underwriting analysis). The idea is neither to predict the future nor to enable insurance for its own sake, but to use narrative and underwriting tools together to generate probability distributions over outcomes. We formalize this process using a simplified catastrophic Lévy stochastic framework and propose an iterative institutional design in which (1) speculation (including scenario planning) generates detailed catastrophic event narratives, (2) insurance underwriters assign probabilistic and financial parameters to these narratives, and (3) decision-makers synthesize the results into summary statistics to inform judgment. Analysis of the model reveals the value of (a) maintaining independence between speculation and underwriting, (b) analyzing multiple risk categories in parallel, and (c) generating \"thick\" catastrophic narrative rich in causal (counterfactual) and mitigative detail. While the approach cannot eliminate deep ambiguity, it offers a systematic approach to reason about extreme, low-probability events in frontier AI, tempering complacency and overreaction. The framework is adaptable for iterative use and can further augmented with AI systems."}

This paper conducts a comparative legal study of policy instruments across ten countries, examining how telecom, cybersecurity, data protection, and AI laws approach AI-related risks in infrastructure. The study finds that regulatory responses remain siloed, with minimal coordination across these domains. Most frameworks still prioritize traditional cybersecurity and data protection concerns, offering limited recognition of AI-specific vulnerabilities such as model drift, opaque decision-making, and algorithmic bias. Telecommunications regulations, in particular, exhibit little integration of AI considerations, despite AI systems increasingly supporting critical network operations.

The dependence of battery performance on operating temperature, the lack of waste combustion heat, and the significant effect of TMS energy consumption on driving range make the design of BEV TMSs highly complicated compared to conventional vehicles. Although prior research has focused on optimizing the configuration of thermal systems for varying ambient conditions, a holistic approach to studying the full potential of reconfigurable TMS architectures has not yet been fully explored. The complex design landscape of multi-mode reconfigurable systems is difficult to navigate. Relying solely on expert intuition and creativity to identify new architectures both restricts progress and leaves significant performance improvements unrealized. In this study, using graph modelling of TMS architectures, we propose a systematic method to automatically enumerate and simulate reconfigurable architectures for a TMS, given the desired operating modes, along with a framework to conduct transient performance analysis and optimization-based trade-off studies among system performance, energy consumption, and complexity. We explored more than 150 operating mode sequences, retaining 39 unique architectures for further evaluation. MATLAB Simscape models of these architectures were automatically created and their performance evaluated. The multi-objective optimization results provide decision support for selecting the best architecture based on user priorities."}

We develop a simple model in which monitoring is a public good on a network with strategic complementarities. A regulator chooses between decentralized monitoring (cheaper, local oversight) and centralized monitoring (more costly, but internalizing spillovers). The model delivers an endogenous centralization threshold: for a given spillover strength, there exists a network size $n^\\ast(λ)$ above which centralized monitoring strictly dominates; equivalently, for a given network size $n$, there is a critical complementarity $λ^\\ast(n)$ beyond which decentralized oversight becomes fragile. A stochastic extension suggests that, above this region, idiosyncratic shocks are amplified, producing stronger peer correlations, higher variance, and more frequent deterioration in quality. We test these predictions in the U.S. nursing home sector, where facilities belong to overlapping organizational (chain) and geographic (county) networks. Using CMS facility data, We document strong within-chain and within-county peer effects and estimate network-size thresholds for severe regulatory failure (Special Focus Facility designations). We find sharp breakpoints at roughly 7 homes per county and 34 homes per chain, above which spillovers intensify and deficiency outcomes become more dispersed and prone to deterioration, especially in large counties."}

The study documents several findings both in country-specific and in panel estimation analysis. First, we find that forward-looking characteristic of inflation picks up weight after 1990's which indicates that inflation became more sensitive to the expected prices. Second, we observe that inflation in developed markets is more forward-looking comparing to emerging and frontier markets. This indicates that developed markets dear forward-looking price expectations more than other markets.

We explore the biological basis of hand synergies and human gesture analysis, translating joint-level coordination and structural attributes into a modular finger architecture. Leveraging these biomimetic mappings, we design a five-finger modular hand and establish its kinematic model to analyze adaptive grasping and in-hand manipulation. Finally, we construct a physical prototype and conduct preliminary experiments, which validate the effectiveness of the proposed design and analysis."}

While neural networks have demonstrated strong predictive accuracy, they often fail to preserve critical physical properties such as stability and typically assume stationary dynamics, limiting their applicability under distribution shifts. Existing approaches generally address either stability or adaptability in isolation, lacking a unified framework that ensures both. We propose LILAD (Learning In-Context Lyapunov-stable Adaptive Dynamics), a novel framework for system identification that jointly guarantees adaptability and stability. LILAD simultaneously learns a dynamics model and a Lyapunov function through in-context learning (ICL), explicitly accounting for parametric uncertainty. Trained across a diverse set of tasks, LILAD produces a stability-aware, adaptive dynamics model alongside an adaptive Lyapunov certificate. At test time, both components adapt to a new system instance using a short trajectory prompt, which enables fast generalization. To rigorously ensure stability, LILAD also computes a state-dependent attenuator that enforces a sufficient decrease condition on the Lyapunov function for any state in the new system instance. This mechanism extends stability guarantees even under out-of-distribution and out-of-task scenarios. We evaluate LILAD on benchmark autonomous systems and demonstrate that it outperforms adaptive, robust, and non-adaptive baselines in predictive accuracy."}

However, this progress comes at a considerable cost to the environment as training and deploying these models consume significant computational resources and energy and are responsible for large carbon footprints in the atmosphere. In this paper, we study the amount of carbon dioxide released by models across different domains over varying time periods. By examining parameters such as model size, repository activity (e.g., commits and repository age), task type, and organizational affiliation, we identify key factors influencing the environmental impact of AI development. Our findings reveal that model size and versioning frequency are strongly correlated with higher emissions, while domain-specific trends show that NLP models tend to have lower carbon footprints compared to audio-based systems. Organizational context also plays a significant role, with university-driven projects exhibiting the highest emissions, followed by non-profits and companies, while community-driven projects show a reduction in emissions. These results highlight the critical need for green AI practices, including the adoption of energy-efficient architectures, optimizing development workflows, and leveraging renewable energy sources. We also discuss a few practices that can lead to a more sustainable future with AI, and we end this paper with some future research directions that could be motivated by our work.

The model shows that, when sex is explicitly modelled, the suppression and deterrence effects coexist, which makes the net societal impact of HIV stigma ambiguous.

This framework is applied to a non-premixed burner configuration targeting improved thermal efficiency under hydrogen-enriched fuels. A calibrated runtime model t_hat(h, l, s) penalizes computationally expensive queries, while a constrained noisy expected improvement (qNEI) guides sampling under an emissions cap of 2e-6 for NOx.\n  Surrogates trained on CFD data exhibit stable hyperparameters and physically consistent sensitivities: mean temperature increases with reactor length and fidelity and is weakly negative with height; NOx grows with temperature yet tends to decrease with length.

We study whether this reporting task is inherently difficult and how reporting interfaces affect accuracy and welfare. In laboratory experiments, we induce preferences over programs via utility over attributes, generating lexicographic, separable, or complementary preferences. We compare three reporting interfaces for the direct serial dictatorship mechanism: (i) a full ranking over programs; (ii) a lexicographic-nesting interface; and (iii) a weighted-attributes interface, the latter two eliciting rankings over attributes rather than programs. We also study the sequential serial dictatorship mechanism that is obviously strategy-proof and simplifies reporting by asking for a single choice at each step. Finally, we run a baseline that elicits a full ranking over programs but rewards pure accuracy rather than allocation outcomes. Four main findings emerge. First, substantial misreporting occurs even in the pure-accuracy baseline and increases with preference complexity. Second, serial dictatorship induces additional mistakes consistent with misperceived incentives. Third, simplified interfaces for the direct serial dictatorship fail to improve (and sometimes reduce) accuracy, even when they match the preference structure. Fourth, sequential choice achieves the highest accuracy while improving efficiency and reducing justified envy. These findings caution against restricted reporting languages and favor sequential choice when ranking burdens are salient."}

This leads to theoretical challenges in the multi-agent setting where the non-stationarity induced by the learning of other agents demands prospective learning based on prediction models. To accurately model other agents, an agent must account for the fact that those other agents are, in turn, forming beliefs about it to predict its future behavior, motivating agents to model themselves as part of the environment. Here, building upon foundational work on universal artificial intelligence (AIXI), we introduce a mathematical framework for prospective learning and embedded agency centered on self-prediction, where Bayesian RL agents predict both future perceptual inputs and their own actions, and must therefore resolve epistemic uncertainty about themselves as part of the universe they inhabit. We show that in multi-agent settings, self-prediction enables agents to reason about others running similar algorithms, leading to new game-theoretic solution concepts and novel forms of cooperation unattainable by classical decoupled agents. Moreover, we extend the theory of AIXI, and study universally intelligent embedded agents which start from a Solomonoff prior. We show that these idealized agents can form consistent mutual predictions and achieve infinite-order theory of mind, potentially setting a gold standard for embedded multi-agent learning."}

Together, our assessments point to the relative suitability of three measures: normalized betweenness centralization, normalized closeness centralization, and normalized degree centralization. Applying these three measures to real-world networks from diverse domains reveals meaningful variation in the organization of the networks with respect to hubs. Normalized betweenness centralization highlights path-based dominance; normalized closeness centralization reflects accessibility and efficiency of reach; and normalized degree centralization captures degree-based hub concentration. When used jointly, the three measures demonstrate the required sensitivity to varying levels of centralization and provide complementary aspects of network centralization that no single measure can offer alone. Our dual evaluation framework clarifies conceptual differences among existing measures and offers practical guidance for selecting reliable centralization metrics."}

Analyzing 396 AI-generated images across 12 countries and 3 models, we reveal an evolution: Visual Orientalism has shifted from traditional West-versus-East binaries to English-language centrism, where only English-speaking core countries (USA and UK) receive political representation while all other nations -- including European powers -- face cultural exoticization. This algorithmic reconfiguration of Orientalism operates through automated framing mechanisms shaped by the material conditions of AI development: English-language training data dominance and the concentration of AI development in English-speaking tech companies. Our findings demonstrate how AI systems function as agents of cultural representation that perpetuate and intensify historical power asymmetries.

In this work, we propose a neural network-based safe tracking control framework for nonlinear discrete-time systems with reach-avoid specifications in the presence of disturbances. Our approach begins with generation of a nominal trajectory using standard trajectory synthesis approaches, followed by construction of safe zonotopic backward reachable sets along the nominal trajectory. The states lying within the backward reachable sets are guaranteed to satisfy safe reachability specifications. Then, our key insight is to leverage the computed backward reachable sets to inform the architecture and training of a neural network-based tracking controller such that the neural network drives the system's states through these backward reachable sets, thereby improving the likelihood of safe reachability. We perform formal verification with conformal prediction to achieve statistical safety guarantees on the performance of the learned neural controller. The performance of our approach is illustrated through a numerical example on the discrete-time Dubin's car model."}

Its aim is to determine whether this law, formulated by Marx in Capital (Vol. III), continues to operate in the contemporary context. The methodology consists of transforming orthodox macroeconomic categories derived from the Spanish National Accounts (CNE), available in BDMACRO, into Marxist variables: constant capital ($c$), variable capital ($v$), and surplus value ($pv$). Based on these, historical series of the organic composition of capital ($q$), the rate of surplus value ($pv'$), and the rate of profit ($g'$) are constructed, adjusted to constant prices to ensure temporal coherence and comparability. The results show a sustained increase in $q$ and a slight decrease in $pv'$, generating a tendential decline in $g'$ with cyclical fluctuations associated with specific crises. The conclusions empirically confirm the validity of the law in Spain, highlighting the historical limits of capitalism and providing quantitative evidence on the structural dynamics of profitability."}

But for such complex systems, estimating the magnitude of events which are both non-linear and rare is extremely challenging, and involves considerable computational cost to capture the high-fidelity physics. To address this challenge, we offer a new multi-fidelity screening method, Probabilistic Adaptive Screening (PAS), which accurately predicts extreme values of strongly non-linear wave-induced loads while minimising the required high-fidelity simulation duration. The method introduces a probabilistic approach to multi-fidelity screening, allowing efficient linear potential flow indicators to be used in the low-fidelity stage, even for strongly non-linear load cases. The method is validated against a range of cases, including non-linear waves, and ship vertical bending moments, green water impact loads, and slamming loads. It can be concluded that PAS accurately estimates both the short-term distributions and extreme values in all test cases, with most probable maximum (MPM) values within 10\\% of the available full brute-force Monte-Carlo Simulation (MCS) results. In addition, PAS achieves this performance very efficiently, requiring less than 4\\% of the high-fidelity simulation time needed for conventional MCS. These results demonstrate that PAS can reliably reproduce the statistics of both weakly and strongly non-linear extreme load problems, while significantly reducing the associated computational cost. The present study validates the statistical PAS framework; further work should focus on validating the full procedure including CFD load simulations, and on validating it for long-term extremes."}

Uni-modal choices are those when the outcomes being compared over time are very similar, and cross-modal choices are those when the outcomes are very different. The cross-modal effect, previously shown in the U.S., is that there is greater patience in cross-modal decisions. In Experiment 1, we employed a between-participants design, in which participants either made uni-modal or cross-modal decisions. In Experiment 2, we employed a within-participants design in which everyone made both types of decision. In both Experiments we replicated the cross-modal effect. Moreover, the magnitude of the effect did not vary with factors known to relate to time preference, such as cognitive ability and social status, and it did not differ across cultures, even though Japanese participants were much more patient than American ones. The effect was stronger in the between- than within-participants experiment. These results strengthen the conclusion that the cross-modal effect is universal and strengthens the argument that it is due to the fundamental process of attentional dilution."}

Robots employ a conjugate prior to gradually predict the times between events and derive confidence estimates to adapt their behavior. Our simulation results show that the robot swarm consistently chooses the correct area while reducing exposure to hazardous events by being sample-efficient. Compared to baseline heuristics, our proposed approach shows better performance in terms of safety and speed of convergence.

However, GUI agents still face significant challenges in handling long-horizon tasks. First, single-agent models struggle to balance high-level capabilities and low-level execution capability, facing prevalent issues of responsibility coupling and capability conflicts. Second, agents lack awareness of the task state, leading to progress loss in long-horizon tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a staged execution-feedback reinforcement learning algorithm. Unlike training a unified policy model, we focus on training high-level scheduling models. Specifically, we propose and train two agents: a Coordinator, responsible for the strategic planning and task decomposition; and a State Tracker, responsible for context compression and information management to maintain the task's state and coherence. Based on this, we built the Coordinator-Executor-State Tracker (CES) multi-agent framework, which can be integrated with any low-level Executor model, assisting the Executor in solving long-horizon tasks through task scheduling and state management. Experiments on long-horizon task benchmarks demonstrate that CES significantly enhances the system's planning and state management capabilities. Furthermore, analysis confirms that our trained high-level scheduling module is a generalizable, plug-and-play module that significantly enhances the long-horizon capabilities of various Executors.

Existing policy iteration methods for optimal control must start from a stabilizing control policy, which is particularly challenging to obtain for unknown systems, especially when states are unavailable. In such cases, it is more difficult to guarantee stability and convergence performance. To address this problem, an output-feedback stabilizing policy iteration framework is developed to learn closed-loop stabilizing control policies while ensuring convergence performance. Specifically, cumulative scalar parameters are introduced to compress the original system to a stable scale. Then, by integrating modified policy iteration with parameter update rules, the system is gradually amplified/restored to the original system while preserving stability such that the stabilizing control policy is obtained. The entire process is driven solely by input-output data. Moreover, a stability analysis is provided for output-feedback. The proposed approach is validated by simulations."}

The dependence of battery performance on operating temperature, the lack of waste combustion heat, and the significant effect of TMS energy consumption on driving range make the design of BEV TMSs highly complicated compared to conventional vehicles. Although prior research has focused on optimizing the configuration of thermal systems for varying ambient conditions, a holistic approach to studying the full potential of reconfigurable TMS architectures has not yet been fully explored. The complex design landscape of multi-mode reconfigurable systems is difficult to navigate. Relying solely on expert intuition and creativity to identify new architectures both restricts progress and leaves significant performance improvements unrealized. In this study, using graph modelling of TMS architectures, we propose a systematic method to automatically enumerate and simulate reconfigurable architectures for a TMS, given the desired operating modes, along with a framework to conduct transient performance analysis and optimization-based trade-off studies among system performance, energy consumption, and complexity. We explored more than 150 operating mode sequences, retaining 39 unique architectures for further evaluation. MATLAB Simscape models of these architectures were automatically created and their performance evaluated. The multi-objective optimization results provide decision support for selecting the best architecture based on user priorities."}

However, this progress comes at a considerable cost to the environment as training and deploying these models consume significant computational resources and energy and are responsible for large carbon footprints in the atmosphere. In this paper, we study the amount of carbon dioxide released by models across different domains over varying time periods. By examining parameters such as model size, repository activity (e.g., commits and repository age), task type, and organizational affiliation, we identify key factors influencing the environmental impact of AI development. Our findings reveal that model size and versioning frequency are strongly correlated with higher emissions, while domain-specific trends show that NLP models tend to have lower carbon footprints compared to audio-based systems. Organizational context also plays a significant role, with university-driven projects exhibiting the highest emissions, followed by non-profits and companies, while community-driven projects show a reduction in emissions. These results highlight the critical need for green AI practices, including the adoption of energy-efficient architectures, optimizing development workflows, and leveraging renewable energy sources. We also discuss a few practices that can lead to a more sustainable future with AI, and we end this paper with some future research directions that could be motivated by our work.

Network Scale and the Breakdown of Decentralized Monitoring", "comment": null, "summary": "Many public services are produced in networked systems where quality depends on local effort and on how higher-level authorities monitor providers. We develop a simple model in which monitoring is a public good on a network with strategic complementarities. A regulator chooses between decentralized monitoring (cheaper, local oversight) and centralized monitoring (more costly, but internalizing spillovers). The model delivers an endogenous centralization threshold: for a given spillover strength, there exists a network size $n^\\ast(λ)$ above which centralized monitoring strictly dominates; equivalently, for a given network size $n$, there is a critical complementarity $λ^\\ast(n)$ beyond which decentralized oversight becomes fragile. A stochastic extension suggests that, above this region, idiosyncratic shocks are amplified, producing stronger peer correlations, higher variance, and more frequent deterioration in quality. We test these predictions in the U.S. nursing home sector, where facilities belong to overlapping organizational (chain) and geographic (county) networks. Using CMS facility data, We document strong within-chain and within-county peer effects and estimate network-size thresholds for severe regulatory failure (Special Focus Facility designations). We find sharp breakpoints at roughly 7 homes per county and 34 homes per chain, above which spillovers intensify and deficiency outcomes become more dispersed and prone to deterioration, especially in large counties."}

Adaptive Resonance Theory-based Topological Clustering with Different Topologies (ATC-DT) builds global topological maps represented as graphs while mitigating catastrophic forgetting during sequential processing. However, its winner selection mechanism relies on an exhaustive nearest-neighbor search over all existing nodes, leading to scalability limitations as the map grows. To address this challenge, we propose a hierarchical extension called Multi-Layer ATC (MLATC). MLATC organizes nodes into a hierarchy, enabling the nearest-neighbor search to proceed from coarse to fine resolutions, thereby drastically reducing the number of distance evaluations per query. The number of layers is not fixed in advance. MLATC employs an adaptive layer addition mechanism that automatically deepens the hierarchy when lower layers become saturated, keeping the number of user-defined hyperparameters low. Simulation experiments on synthetic large-scale environments show that MLATC accelerates topological map building compared to the original ATC-DT and exhibits a sublinear, approximately logarithmic scaling of search time with respect to the number of nodes. Experiments on campus-scale real-world LiDAR datasets confirm that MLATC maintains a millisecond-level per-frame runtime and enables real-time global topological map building in large-scale environments, significantly outperforming the original ATC-DT in terms of computational efficiency."}

However, the effectiveness of agents remains tightly coupled with the quality of training data, while curating task-specific datasets remains costly and often infeasible in real-world scenarios. Recent work has explored self-improving agents that autonomously generate, refine, and re-train on their own trajectories. A prominent line of approaches further leverages preference optimization by pairing predicted trajectories with scarce ground-truth trajectories, enabling agents to learn directly from their own failures. While these methods outperform supervised fine-tuning, their heavy reliance on predicted trajectories under limited ground-truth supervision leaves them prone to overfitting. To address this, we propose a co-evolving agents framework in which a target agent improves jointly with an auxiliary failure agent. The failure agent learns through preference optimization over failure trajectories from both the target and itself, thereby generating hard negatives that are close to success yet remain failures. Incorporating these informative hard negatives into the target agent's optimization sharpens decision boundaries and enhances generalization. Our comprehensive analysis and experiments across benchmark datasets show that our method not only shows improved performance but also demonstrates that failures, instead of being used as-is, can be systematically transformed into structured and valuable learning signals in self-improving agents."}

Researches of large-scale COD problem can be categorized into iterative approaches that allow DSO to dispatch independently, and non-iterative methods based on projections of feasible regions (FR). However, the iterative methods suffer from low computational convergence and efficiency, while non-iterative methods struggle to solve equivalent projections with high-dimensional FR. To address these issues, this paper proposes a TSO-DSO coordinated dispatch approach based on an accelerated non-iterative Equality Set Projection (ESP) algorithm. First, ESP algorithm is employed to overcome the bottleneck of high-dimensional FR construction. Second, an regularization-based accelerated method is proposed to reduce computational burden when degeneracy occurs. Accelerated ESP algorithm constructs projection of FR via adjacent facet searching. Therefore, it is less sensitive to the increase of vertices and could efficiently construct the projection of high-dimensional FR. Case studies on a polyhedron dataset, IEEE 33-Bus System and T118D10 TSO-DSO system demonstrate the effectiveness and computational efficiency of the proposed COD approach."}

This gap between planning and execution is problematic for time-sensitive applications. To bridge this gap, we propose REMAP, an execution-informed MAPF planning framework that can be combined with leading search-based MAPF planners with minor changes. Our framework integrates the proposed ExecTimeNet to accurately estimate execution time based on planned paths. We demonstrate our method for solving MAPF with Real-world Deadlines (MAPF-RD) problem, where agents must reach their goals before a predefined wall-clock time. We integrate our framework with two popular MAPF methods, MAPF-LNS and CBS.

When the control chamber in the valve is pressurized, the main path is compressed along its central axis, buckling and being pressed,resulting in blockage. This allows control by a pressure signal smaller than that within the main channel. Furthermore, similar to transistors in electrical circuits, when combined, the proposed valve can perform a variety of logical operations. The basic type operates as a NOT logic element, which is named the fluidic sheet transistor (FST). By integrating multiple FSTs, logical operations such as positive logic, NAND, and NOR can be performed on a single sheet.

A core factor underlying effective recommendation dialogue is the ability to infer and reason about users' mental states (such as desire, intention, and belief), a cognitive capacity commonly referred to as Theory of Mind. Despite growing interest in evaluating ToM in LLMs, current benchmarks predominantly rely on synthetic narratives inspired by Sally-Anne test, which emphasize physical perception and fail to capture the complexity of mental state inference in realistic conversational settings. Moreover, existing benchmarks often overlook a critical component of human ToM: behavioral prediction, the ability to use inferred mental states to guide strategic decision-making and select appropriate conversational actions for future interactions. To better align LLM-based ToM evaluation with human-like social reasoning, we propose RecToM, a novel benchmark for evaluating ToM abilities in recommendation dialogues. RecToM focuses on two complementary dimensions: Cognitive Inference and Behavioral Prediction. The former focus on understanding what has been communicated by inferring the underlying mental states. The latter emphasizes what should be done next, evaluating whether LLMs can leverage these inferred mental states to predict, select, and assess appropriate dialogue strategies. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate that RecToM poses a significant challenge. While the models exhibit partial competence in recognizing mental states, they struggle to maintain coherent, strategic ToM reasoning throughout dynamic recommendation dialogues, particularly in tracking evolving intentions and aligning conversational strategies with inferred mental states."}

Although such workloads can be shifted over temporal and spatial horizons, it poses challenges when they cannot be accurately predicted, resulting in significant efficiency degradation and high operational cost of the energy system. The problem becomes even more difficult when the workload shifting decisions would influence their randomness, which is natural for the IDC workloads. To tackle these issues, we propose a workload classification model based on the decision-dependent uncertainty set, where the spatiotemporal elasticity of different types of random workloads are clearly identified and the decision dependencies are explicitly described as linear constraints. Thus, a mixed integer program is then established for the optimal scheduling of both workload demand and energy supply. To enhance system resilience against high volatility scenarios, a rolling horizon algorithm is developed to ensure nonanticipativity and full-scenario feasibility. Numerical tests demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits effective workload scheduling decisions with dramatic energy operational cost reductions compared to the benchmarks under most of the uncertain scenarios."}

Its aim is to determine whether this law, formulated by Marx in Capital (Vol. III), continues to operate in the contemporary context. The methodology consists of transforming orthodox macroeconomic categories derived from the Spanish National Accounts (CNE), available in BDMACRO, into Marxist variables: constant capital ($c$), variable capital ($v$), and surplus value ($pv$). Based on these, historical series of the organic composition of capital ($q$), the rate of surplus value ($pv'$), and the rate of profit ($g'$) are constructed, adjusted to constant prices to ensure temporal coherence and comparability. The results show a sustained increase in $q$ and a slight decrease in $pv'$, generating a tendential decline in $g'$ with cyclical fluctuations associated with specific crises. The conclusions empirically confirm the validity of the law in Spain, highlighting the historical limits of capitalism and providing quantitative evidence on the structural dynamics of profitability."}

Ackermann steering further imposes curvature bounds and forbids in-place rotation, so escaping from narrow dead ends typically requires tightly sequenced forward and reverse maneuvers. Classical planners that decouple global search and local steering struggle in these settings because narrow passages occupy low-measure regions and nonholonomic reachability shrinks the set of valid connections, which degrades sampling efficiency and increases sensitivity to clearances. We study nonholonomic narrow dead-end escape for Ackermann vehicles and contribute three components. First, we construct a generator that samples multi-phase forward-reverse trajectories compatible with Ackermann kinematics and inflates their envelopes to synthesize families of narrow dead ends that are guaranteed to admit at least one feasible escape. Second, we construct a training environment that enforces kinematic constraints and train a policy using the soft actor-critic algorithm. Third, we evaluate against representative classical planners that combine global search with nonholonomic steering. Across parameterized dead-end families, the learned policy solves a larger fraction of instances, reduces maneuver count, and maintains comparable path length and planning time while under the same sensing and control limits.

A Task Manager LLM interprets natural-language goals, classifies tasks, and allocates subtasks using static rules plus dynamic contexts (task, history, robot and task status, and events).Each robot runs a local LLM that composes executable Python code from primitive skills (ROS2 nodes, policies), while onboard perception (VLMs/image processing) continuously monitors events and classifies them into relevant or irrelevant to the task. Task failures or user intent changes trigger replanning, allowing robots to assist teammates, resume tasks, or request human help. Hardware studies demonstrate autonomous recovery from disruptive events, filtering of irrelevant distractions, and tightly coordinated transport with emergent human-robot cooperation (e.g., multirobot collaborative object recovery success rate: 9/10, coordinated transport: 8/8, human-assisted recovery: 5/5).Simulation studies show intention-aware replanning. A curated textual benchmark spanning 22 scenarios (3 tasks each, around 20 robots) evaluates task allocation, classification, IoU, executability, and correctness, with high average scores (e.g., correctness up to 0.91) across multiple LLMs, a separate replanning set (5 scenarios) achieves 1.0 correctness.

Analogous to how knowledge-informed machine learning improves the reliability of conventional data-driven models, our framework incorporates domain-informed text gradients to guide the generative process toward physically meaningful regions of the DP composition space. Systematic comparison of three incremental configurations, (i) pure LLM generation, (ii) LLM generation with LLM reasoning-based feedback, and (iii) LLM generation with domain knowledge-guided feedback, shows that iterative guidance from knowledge-informed gradients improves stability-condition satisfaction without additional training data, achieving over 98% compositional validity and up to 54% stable or metastable candidates, surpassing both the LLM-only baseline (43%) and prior GAN-based results (27%). Analyses of ML-based gradients further reveal that they enhance performance in in-distribution (ID) regions but become unreliable in out-of-distribution (OOD) regimes. Overall, this work provides the first systematic analysis of multi-agent, knowledge-guided text gradients for DP discovery and establishes a generalizable blueprint for MAS-driven generative materials design aimed at advancing sustainable technologies."}

This paper explores preference-based learning as a data-driven approach to constructing an objective function from human preferences over trajectory pairs. We formulate the learning problem as a machine learning classification task to learn a surrogate model that estimates the likelihood of a trajectory being preferred over another. The approach provides a surrogate model that can directly be used as an MPC objective function. Numerical results show that we can learn objective functions that provide closed-loop trajectories that align with the expressed human preferences."}

In this work, we propose a neural network-based safe tracking control framework for nonlinear discrete-time systems with reach-avoid specifications in the presence of disturbances. Our approach begins with generation of a nominal trajectory using standard trajectory synthesis approaches, followed by construction of safe zonotopic backward reachable sets along the nominal trajectory. The states lying within the backward reachable sets are guaranteed to satisfy safe reachability specifications. Then, our key insight is to leverage the computed backward reachable sets to inform the architecture and training of a neural network-based tracking controller such that the neural network drives the system's states through these backward reachable sets, thereby improving the likelihood of safe reachability. We perform formal verification with conformal prediction to achieve statistical safety guarantees on the performance of the learned neural controller. The performance of our approach is illustrated through a numerical example on the discrete-time Dubin's car model."}

Existing policy iteration methods for optimal control must start from a stabilizing control policy, which is particularly challenging to obtain for unknown systems, especially when states are unavailable. In such cases, it is more difficult to guarantee stability and convergence performance. To address this problem, an output-feedback stabilizing policy iteration framework is developed to learn closed-loop stabilizing control policies while ensuring convergence performance. Specifically, cumulative scalar parameters are introduced to compress the original system to a stable scale. Then, by integrating modified policy iteration with parameter update rules, the system is gradually amplified/restored to the original system while preserving stability such that the stabilizing control policy is obtained. The entire process is driven solely by input-output data. Moreover, a stability analysis is provided for output-feedback. The proposed approach is validated by simulations."}

However, most prior approaches update their world representation only at discrete update points such as navigation targets, waypoints, or the end of an action step, leaving robots blind between updates and causing cascading failures: overlooked objects, late error detection, and delayed replanning. To address this limitation, we propose BINDER (Bridging INstant and DEliberative Reasoning), a dual process framework that decouples strategic planning from continuous environment monitoring. Specifically, BINDER integrates a Deliberative Response Module (DRM, a multimodal LLM for task planning) with an Instant Response Module (IRM, a VideoLLM for continuous monitoring). The two modules play complementary roles: the DRM performs strategic planning with structured 3D scene updates and guides what the IRM attends to, while the IRM analyzes video streams to update memory, correct ongoing actions, and trigger replanning when necessary. Through this bidirectional coordination, the modules address the trade off between maintaining awareness and avoiding costly updates, enabling robust adaptation under dynamic conditions. Evaluated in three real world environments with dynamic object placement, BINDER achieves substantially higher success and efficiency than SoTA baselines, demonstrating its effectiveness for real world deployment."}

Current state-of-the-art generative methods, such as protein language models (PLMs) and diffusion-based architectures, often require extensive fine-tuning, task-specific data, or model reconfiguration to support objective-directed design, thereby limiting their flexibility and scalability. To overcome these limitations, we present a decentralized, agent-based framework inspired by swarm intelligence for de novo protein design. In this approach, multiple large language model (LLM) agents operate in parallel, each assigned to a specific residue position. These agents iteratively propose context-aware mutations by integrating design objectives, local neighborhood interactions, and memory and feedback from previous iterations. This position-wise, decentralized coordination enables emergent design of diverse, well-defined sequences without reliance on motif scaffolds or multiple sequence alignments, validated with experiments on proteins with alpha helix and coil structures. Through analyses of residue conservation, structure-based metrics, and sequence convergence and embeddings, we demonstrate that the framework exhibits emergent behaviors and effective navigation of the protein fitness landscape. Our method achieves efficient, objective-directed designs within a few GPU-hours and operates entirely without fine-tuning or specialized training, offering a generalizable and adaptable solution for protein design.

First, ESP algorithm is employed to overcome the bottleneck of high-dimensional FR construction.

However, modeling urban economic vitality remains challenging. This study develops ECO-GROW, a multi-graph framework modeling China's inter-city networks (2005-2021) to generate urban embeddings that model urban economic vitality. Traditional approaches relying on static city-level aggregates fail to capture a fundamental dynamic: the developmental trajectory of one city today may mirror that of its structurally similar counterparts tomorrow. ECO-GROW overcomes this limitation by integrating industrial linkages, POI similarities, migration similarities and temporal network evolution over 15 years. The framework combines a Dynamic Top-K GCN to adaptively select influential inter-city connections and an adaptive Graph Scorer mechanism to dynamically weight cross-regional impacts. Additionally, the model incorporates a link prediction task based on Barabasi Proximity, optimizing the graph representation. Experimental results demonstrate ECO-GROW's superior accuracy in predicting entrepreneurial activities and employment trends compared to conventional models. By open-sourcing our code, we enable government agencies and public sector organizations to leverage big data analytics for evidence-based urban planning, economic policy formulation, and resource allocation decisions that benefit society at large."}

LIBs have high energy density, long cycle life, and favorable safety record. They also have low noise, heat, and emission footprints. This fosters a conducive workplace environment for underground mining personnel. However, many occurrences of LIB failure have resulted in dangerous situations in underground mines. The combustion products, including toxic emissions, can rapidly travel throughout the mine using the ventilation network. Therefore, it is critical to monitor the temperature and smoke concentration underground at all times to ensure the safety of the miners. High-fidelity models can be developed for specific scenarios of LIB failure, but are computationally prohibitive for large underground mine volumes, complex geometries, and long duration combustion events. To mitigate computation-related issues associated with high-fidelity models, we developed cyber-physical systems (CPS) models to examine temperature and smoke dynamics. The mine supervisory control center, acting as the cyber framework, operates in conjunction with the physical underground mine. The CPS models, trained on high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model data sets, present an exceptional estimate of the evolution of temperature and smoke concentration in the underground mine tunnel. Once implemented, the research results can help mine operators make informed decisions during emergencies."}

Although such workloads can be shifted over temporal and spatial horizons, it poses challenges when they cannot be accurately predicted, resulting in significant efficiency degradation and high operational cost of the energy system. The problem becomes even more difficult when the workload shifting decisions would influence their randomness, which is natural for the IDC workloads. To tackle these issues, we propose a workload classification model based on the decision-dependent uncertainty set, where the spatiotemporal elasticity of different types of random workloads are clearly identified and the decision dependencies are explicitly described as linear constraints. Thus, a mixed integer program is then established for the optimal scheduling of both workload demand and energy supply. To enhance system resilience against high volatility scenarios, a rolling horizon algorithm is developed to ensure nonanticipativity and full-scenario feasibility. Numerical tests demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits effective workload scheduling decisions with dramatic energy operational cost reductions compared to the benchmarks under most of the uncertain scenarios."}

In this work, inspired by the denoising capability of diffusion models, we invert the conventional perspective and propose a clean-to-noisy paradigm that learns to synthesize noisy depth, thereby bridging the visual sim2real gap through purely simulation-driven robotic learning. Building on this idea, we introduce RealD$^2$iff, a hierarchical coarse-to-fine diffusion framework that decomposes depth noise into global structural distortions and fine-grained local perturbations. To enable progressive learning of these components, we further develop two complementary strategies: Frequency-Guided Supervision (FGS) for global structure modeling and Discrepancy-Guided Optimization (DGO) for localized refinement. To integrate RealD$^2$iff seamlessly into imitation learning, we construct a pipeline that spans six stages. We provide comprehensive empirical and experimental validation demonstrating the effectiveness of this paradigm. RealD$^2$iff enables two key applications: (1) generating real-world-like depth to construct clean-noisy paired datasets without manual sensor data collection. (2) Achieving zero-shot sim2real robot manipulation, substantially improving real-world performance without additional fine-tuning."}

Without additional constraints, finding this fixed-point requires transfinite iterations. We identify the exact ordinal number corresponding to the length of this iterative process and determine the complexity of deciding grounded acceptance, showing it to be maximally complex. This shows a marked distinction from the finite case where the grounded extension is polynomial-time computable, thus simpler than other reasoning problems explored in formal argumentation."}

To navigate computational complexity, power system dynamic models are often reduced using techniques based on singular perturbation.

This work proposes two singular perturbation approaches that aim to optimally identify fast states that shall be reduced, without prior knowledge about the physical meaning of system states. After presenting a timescale-agnostic formulation for singular perturbation, the first approach uses greedy optimization to sequentially select states to be reduced. The second approach relies on a nonlinear optimization routine allowing state transformations while obtaining an optimally reduced model.

The methodology addresses a critical gap in current practice where investment decisions rely on optimistic benefit projections without accounting for the probabilistic costs of AI-specific threats including model drift, bias-related litigation, and compliance failures under emerging regulations such as the European Union Artificial Intelligence Act and ISO/IEC 42001.

The learned operator predicts future spatial densities of obstacles, which are subsequently represented through Gaussian mixture models.

However, unlike less conservative belief revision methods, minimal revision falls short in learning power: It cannot learn everything that can be learned by other learning methods. We begin by showing that, despite this limitation, minimal revision is still a successful learning method in a wide range of situations. Firstly, it can learn any problem that is finitely identifiable. Secondly, it can learn with positive and negative data, as long as one considers finitely many possibilities. We then characterize the prior plausibility assignments (over finitely many possibilities) that enable one to learn via minimal revision, and do the same for conditioning and lexicographic upgrade. Finally, we show that not all of our results still hold when learning from possibly erroneous information."}

Unlike existing approaches for multi-channel systems, our method addresses underactuation and the potential loss of controllability by additionally addressing channel assignment of agents. To simultaneously account for channel assignment, input constraints, and stabilization, we formulate the control problem as a Mixed Integer Linear Programming and derive sufficient conditions for its feasibility. To improve real-time computation efficiency, we introduce an event-triggered control scheme that maintains stability even between switching events through a quadratic programming-based stabilizing controller. We theoretically establish the semi-global exponential stability of the proposed method and the asymptotic stability of its extension to nonprehensile cooperative manipulation under noninstantaneous switching. The proposed framework is further validated through numerical simulations on 2D and 3D free-flyer systems and multi-robot nonprehensile pushing tasks."}

Recent explorations predominantly focus on visual lesion feature extraction through data processing and domain decoupling strategies. However, they generally overlook domain-invariant pathological patterns and underutilize the rich contextual knowledge of foundation models, relying solely on visual information, which is insufficient for distinguishing subtle pathological variations. Therefore, we propose integrating fine-grained pathological descriptions to complement prototypes with additional context, thereby resolving ambiguities in borderline cases. Specifically, we propose a Hierarchical Anchor Prototype Modulation (HAPM) framework to facilitate DR grading. First, we introduce a variance spectrum-driven anchor prototype library that preserves domain-invariant pathological patterns. We further employ a hierarchical differential prompt gating mechanism, dynamically selecting discriminative semantic prompts from both LVLM and LLM sources to address semantic confusion between adjacent DR grades. Finally, we utilize a two-stage prototype modulation strategy that progressively integrates clinical knowledge into visual prototypes through a Pathological Semantic Injector (PSI) and a Discriminative Prototype Enhancer (DPE). Extensive experiments across eight public datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves pathology-guided prototype evolution while outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

This paper explores preference-based learning as a data-driven approach to constructing an objective function from human preferences over trajectory pairs. We formulate the learning problem as a machine learning classification task to learn a surrogate model that estimates the likelihood of a trajectory being preferred over another.

To address this challenge, we introduce the LIBERO-Elegant benchmark with explicit criteria for evaluating execution quality. Using these criteria, we develop a decoupled refinement framework that improves execution quality without modifying or retraining the base VLA policy. We formalize Elegant Execution as the satisfaction of Implicit Task Constraints (ITCs) and train an Elegance Critic via offline Calibrated Q-Learning to estimate the expected quality of candidate actions. At inference time, a Just-in-Time Intervention (JITI) mechanism monitors critic confidence and intervenes only at decision-critical moments, providing selective, on-demand refinement.

In this context, optogenetics enables modulation of gene expression using light as an external input, allowing fine-tuning of protein levels to unlock dynamic metabolic control and regulation of cell growth. Optogenetic systems can be actuated by light intensity. However, relying solely on intensity-driven control (i.e., signal amplitude) may fail to properly tune optogenetic bioprocesses when the dose-response relationship (i.e., light intensity versus gene-expression strength) is steep. In these cases, tunability is effectively constrained to either fully active or fully repressed gene expression, with little intermediate regulation. Pulse-width modulation, a concept widely used in electronics, can alleviate this issue by alternating between fully ON and OFF light intensity within forcing periods, thereby smoothing the average response and enhancing process controllability. Naturally, optimizing pulse-width-modulated optogenetics entails a switching-time optimal control problem with a binary input over many forcing periods. While this can be formulated as a mixed-integer program on a refined time grid, the number of decision variables can grow rapidly with increasing time-grid resolution and number of forcing periods, compromising tractability. Here, we propose an alternative solution based on reinforcement learning. We parametrize control actions via the duty cycle, a continuous variable that encodes the ON-to-OFF switching time within each forcing period, thereby respecting the intrinsic binary nature of the light intensity."}

To address this gap, we introduce an AI agent polling framework, leveraging large language models to assess community opinion on data centers and guide responsible development of AI. Our experiments reveal water consumption and utility costs as primary concerns, while tax revenue is a key perceived benefit. Furthermore, our cross-model and cross-regional analyses show opinions vary significantly by LLM and regional context. Finally, agent responses show strong topical alignment with real-world survey data. Our framework can serve as a scalable screening tool, enabling developers to integrate community sentiment into early-stage planning for a more informed and socially responsible AI infrastructure deployment."}

LIBs have high energy density, long cycle life, and favorable safety record. They also have low noise, heat, and emission footprints. This fosters a conducive workplace environment for underground mining personnel. However, many occurrences of LIB failure have resulted in dangerous situations in underground mines. The combustion products, including toxic emissions, can rapidly travel throughout the mine using the ventilation network. Therefore, it is critical to monitor the temperature and smoke concentration underground at all times to ensure the safety of the miners. High-fidelity models can be developed for specific scenarios of LIB failure, but are computationally prohibitive for large underground mine volumes, complex geometries, and long duration combustion events. To mitigate computation-related issues associated with high-fidelity models, we developed cyber-physical systems (CPS) models to examine temperature and smoke dynamics. The mine supervisory control center, acting as the cyber framework, operates in conjunction with the physical underground mine. The CPS models, trained on high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model data sets, present an exceptional estimate of the evolution of temperature and smoke concentration in the underground mine tunnel. Once implemented, the research results can help mine operators make informed decisions during emergencies."}

Yet, unlike VLMs in the vision-language domain, VLAs for robotics require finetuning to contend with varying physical factors like robot embodiment, environment characteristics, and spatial relationships of each task. Existing fine-tuning methods lack specificity, adapting the same set of parameters regardless of a task's visual, linguistic, and physical characteristics. Inspired by functional specificity in neuroscience, we hypothesize that it is more effective to finetune sparse model representations specific to a given task. In this work, we introduce Robotic Steering, a finetuning approach grounded in mechanistic interpretability that leverages few-shot demonstrations to identify and selectively finetune task-specific attention heads aligned with the physical, visual, and linguistic requirements of robotic tasks. Through comprehensive on-robot evaluations with a Franka Emika robot arm, we demonstrate that Robotic Steering outperforms LoRA while achieving superior robustness under task variation, reduced computational cost, and enhanced interpretability for adapting VLAs to diverse robotic tasks."}

Across multiple datasets and query structures, we find several cases where neural and relaxation-based approaches perform similarly, with no neural model consistently outperforming the latter. Moreover, a similarity analysis reveals that their retrieved answers exhibit little overlap, and that combining their outputs consistently improves performance. These results call for a re-evaluation of progress in neural query answering: despite their complexity, current models fail to subsume the reasoning patterns captured by query relaxation. Our findings highlight the importance of stronger non-neural baselines and suggest that future neural approaches could benefit from incorporating principles of query relaxation."}

To navigate computational complexity, power system dynamic models are often reduced using techniques based on singular perturbation. However, several technical assumptions enabling traditional approaches are being challenged due to the heterogeneous, and often black-box, nature of modern power system component models. This work proposes two singular perturbation approaches that aim to optimally identify fast states that shall be reduced, without prior knowledge about the physical meaning of system states. After presenting a timescale-agnostic formulation for singular perturbation, the first approach uses greedy optimization to sequentially select states to be reduced. The second approach relies on a nonlinear optimization routine allowing state transformations while obtaining an optimally reduced model. Numerical studies on a test system featuring synchronous machines, inverters, and line dynamics demonstrate the generalizability and accuracy of the developed approaches."}

By scaling reasoning with reinforcement learning that rewards correct final answers, LLMs have improved from poor performance to saturating quantitative reasoning competitions like AIME and HMMT in one year. However, this approach faces fundamental limitations. Pursuing higher final answer accuracy doesn't address a key issue: correct answers don't guarantee correct reasoning. Moreover, many mathematical tasks like theorem proving require rigorous step-by-step derivation rather than numerical answers, making final answer rewards inapplicable. To push the limits of deep reasoning, we believe it is necessary to verify the comprehensiveness and rigor of mathematical reasoning. Self-verification is particularly important for scaling test-time compute, especially for open problems without known solutions. Towards self-verifiable mathematical reasoning, we investigate how to train an accurate and faithful LLM-based verifier for theorem proving. We then train a proof generator using the verifier as the reward model, and incentivize the generator to identify and resolve as many issues as possible in their own proofs before finalizing them. To maintain the generation-verification gap as the generator becomes stronger, we propose to scale verification compute to automatically label new hard-to-verify proofs, creating training data to further improve the verifier. Our resulting model, DeepSeekMath-V2, demonstrates strong theorem-proving capabilities, achieving gold-level scores on IMO 2025 and CMO 2024 and a near-perfect 118/120 on Putnam 2024 with scaled test-time compute."}

This difficulty mainly arises because most existing planning frameworks operate in an open-loop manner, making it hard to cope with environmental uncertainties such as wind disturbances or external perturbations. This paper presents a unified real-time navigation framework for quadrotors in unknown complex environments, based on the online construction of guiding vector fields (GVFs) from discrete reference path points. In the framework, onboard perception modules build a Euclidean Signed Distance Field (ESDF) representation of the environment, which enables obstacle awareness and path distance evaluation. The system first generates discrete, collision-free path points using a global planner, and then parameterizes them via uniform B-splines to produce a smooth and physically feasible reference trajectory. An adaptive GVF is then synthesized from the ESDF and the optimized B-spline trajectory. Unlike conventional approaches, the method adopts a closed-loop navigation paradigm, which significantly enhances robustness under external disturbances. Compared with conventional GVF methods, the proposed approach directly accommodates discretized paths and maintains compatibility with standard planning algorithms. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate improved robustness against external disturbances and superior real-time performance."}

These systems are inspired by cooperative manipulation tasks involving underactuation, where multiple underactuated agents collaboratively push or pull an object to a target pose. Unlike existing approaches for multi-channel systems, our method addresses underactuation and the potential loss of controllability by additionally addressing channel assignment of agents. To simultaneously account for channel assignment, input constraints, and stabilization, we formulate the control problem as a Mixed Integer Linear Programming and derive sufficient conditions for its feasibility. To improve real-time computation efficiency, we introduce an event-triggered control scheme that maintains stability even between switching events through a quadratic programming-based stabilizing controller. We theoretically establish the semi-global exponential stability of the proposed method and the asymptotic stability of its extension to nonprehensile cooperative manipulation under noninstantaneous switching. The proposed framework is further validated through numerical simulations on 2D and 3D free-flyer systems and multi-robot nonprehensile pushing tasks."}

Yet, these methods mostly rely on egocentric (first-person) perception, limiting their performance, especially when the viewpoint of the robot is occluded. A promising solution would be to enhance the robot's environmental awareness by using complementary viewpoints, such as multiple actors exchanging perceptual information. Inspired by this idea, this work proposes a multi-view depth-based locomotion framework that combines egocentric and exocentric observations to provide richer environmental context during agile locomotion. Using a teacher-student distillation approach, the student policy learns to fuse proprioception with dual depth streams while remaining robust to real-world sensing imperfections. To further improve robustness, we introduce extensive domain randomization, including stochastic remote-camera dropouts and 3D positional perturbations that emulate aerial-ground cooperative sensing. Simulation results show that multi-viewpoints policies outperform single-viewpoint baseline in gap crossing, step descent, and other dynamic maneuvers, while maintaining stability when the exocentric camera is partially or completely unavailable. Additional experiments show that moderate viewpoint misalignment is well tolerated when incorporated during training. This study demonstrates that heterogeneous visual feedback improves robustness and agility in quadrupedal locomotion.

AI deception, in which systems induce false beliefs to secure self-beneficial outcomes, has evolved from a speculative concern to an empirically demonstrated risk across language models, AI agents, and emerging frontier systems. This project provides a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of the AI deception field, covering its core concepts, methodologies, genesis, and potential mitigations. First, we identify a formal definition of AI deception, grounded in signaling theory from studies of animal deception. We then review existing empirical studies and associated risks, highlighting deception as a sociotechnical safety challenge. We organize the landscape of AI deception research as a deception cycle, consisting of two key components: deception emergence and deception treatment. Deception emergence reveals the mechanisms underlying AI deception: systems with sufficient capability and incentive potential inevitably engage in deceptive behaviors when triggered by external conditions. Deception treatment, in turn, focuses on detecting and addressing such behaviors. On deception emergence, we analyze incentive foundations across three hierarchical levels and identify three essential capability preconditions required for deception. We further examine contextual triggers, including supervision gaps, distributional shifts, and environmental pressures. On deception treatment, we conclude detection methods covering benchmarks and evaluation protocols in static and interactive settings. Building on the three core factors of deception emergence, we outline potential mitigation strategies and propose auditing approaches that integrate technical, community, and governance efforts to address sociotechnical challenges and future AI risks.

To bridge this gap, this work proposes a novel E2E learning based RSE framework, where the RSE problem is innovatively constructed as an explicit differentiable layer of NN for the first time, ensuring physics alignments with rigors. Also, the measurement weights are treated as learnable parameters of NN to enhance estimation robustness. A hybrid loss function is formulated to pursue accurate and physically consistent solutions. To realize the proposed NN structure, the original non-convex RSE problem is specially relaxed.

However, achieving optimal performance following this regiment requires a large-scale dataset, which is costly to obtain, especially for challenging tasks, such as collision avoidance. In those tasks, generalization at test time demands coverage of many obstacles types and their spatial configurations, which are impractical to acquire purely via data. To remedy this problem, we propose Context-Aware diffusion policy via Proximal mode Expansion (CAPE), a framework that expands trajectory distribution modes with context-aware prior and guidance at inference via a novel prior-seeded iterative guided refinement procedure. The framework generates an initial trajectory plan and executes a short prefix trajectory, and then the remaining trajectory segment is perturbed to an intermediate noise level, forming a trajectory prior. Such a prior is context-aware and preserves task intent. Repeating the process with context-aware guided denoising iteratively expands mode support to allow finding smoother, less collision-prone trajectories. For collision avoidance, CAPE expands trajectory distribution modes with collision-aware context, enabling the sampling of collision-free trajectories in previously unseen environments while maintaining goal consistency. We evaluate CAPE on diverse manipulation tasks in cluttered unseen simulated and real-world settings and show up to 26% and 80% higher success rates respectively compared to SOTA methods, demonstrating better generalization to unseen environments."}

Powered by Large Language and Vision-Language Models, IoA enables the development of interactive, rational agents capable of complex cooperation, moving far beyond traditional isolated models. IoA involves physical entities, i.e., Wireless Agents (WAs) with limited onboard resources, which need to offload their compute-intensive agentic AI services to nearby servers. Such servers can be Mobile Agents (MAs), e.g., vehicle agents, or Fixed Agents (FAs), e.g., end-side units agents. Given their fixed geographical locations and stable connectivity, FAs can serve as reliable communication gateways and task aggregation points. This stability allows them to effectively coordinate with and offload to an Aerial Agent (AA) tier, which has an advantage not affordable for highly mobile MAs with dynamic connectivity limitations. As such, we propose a two-tier optimization approach. The first tier employs a multi-leader multi-follower Stackelberg game. In the game, MAs and FAs act as the leaders who set resource prices. WAs are the followers to determine task offloading ratios. However, when FAs become overloaded, they can further offload tasks to available aerial resources. Therefore, the second tier introduces a Double Dutch Auction model where overloaded FAs act as the buyers to request resources, and AAs serve as the sellers for resource provision. We then develop a diffusion-based Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm to solve the model. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed scheme in facilitating task offloading."}

In these cases, tunability is effectively constrained to either fully active or fully repressed gene expression, with little intermediate regulation. Pulse-width modulation, a concept widely used in electronics, can alleviate this issue by alternating between fully ON and OFF light intensity within forcing periods, thereby smoothing the average response and enhancing process controllability. Naturally, optimizing pulse-width-modulated optogenetics entails a switching-time optimal control problem with a binary input over many forcing periods. While this can be formulated as a mixed-integer program on a refined time grid, the number of decision variables can grow rapidly with increasing time-grid resolution and number of forcing periods, compromising tractability. Here, we propose an alternative solution based on reinforcement learning. We parametrize control actions via the duty cycle, a continuous variable that encodes the ON-to-OFF switching time within each forcing period, thereby respecting the intrinsic binary nature of the light intensity."}

In this work, we propose an effective and scalable framework, Naturalistic Inpainting for Context Enhancement (NICE). Our method minimizes out-of-distribution (OOD) gap in imitation learning by increasing visual diversity through construction of new experiences using existing demonstrations. By utilizing image generative frameworks and large language models, NICE performs three editing operations, object replacement, restyling, and removal of distracting (non-target) objects. These changes preserve spatial relationships without obstructing target objects and maintain action-label consistency. Unlike previous approaches, NICE requires no additional robot data collection, simulator access, or custom model training, making it readily applicable to existing robotic datasets.\n  Using real-world scenes, we showcase the capability of our framework in producing photo-realistic scene enhancement. For downstream tasks, we use NICE data to finetune a vision-language model (VLM) for spatial affordance prediction and a vision-language-action (VLA) policy for object manipulation. Our evaluations show that NICE successfully minimizes OOD gaps, resulting in over 20% improvement in accuracy for affordance prediction in highly cluttered scenes. For manipulation tasks, success rate increases on average by 11% when testing in environments populated with distractors in different quantities. Furthermore, we show that our method improves visual robustness, lowering target confusion by 6%, and enhances safety by reducing collision rate by 7%."}

Current paradigms fail to bridge this gap. Training-based methods suffer from an ``oracle paradox,'' learning flawed spatial logic from imperfect oracles. Tool-integrated methods constrain the final computation but critically leave the VLM's planning process unconstrained, resulting in geometrically flawed plans. In this work, we propose Geometrically-Constrained Agent (GCA), a training-free agentic paradigm that resolves this gap by introducing a formal task constraint. Specifically, we strategically decouples the VLM's role into two stages. First, acting as a semantic analyst, the VLM translates the user's ambiguous query into the formal, verifiable task constraint, which defines the reference frame and objective. Second, acting as a task solver, the VLM generates and executes tool calls strictly within the deterministic bounds defined by the constraint. This geometrically-constrained reasoning strategy successfully resolve the semantic-to-geometric gap, yielding a robust and verifiable reasoning pathway for spatial reasoning. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that GCA achieves SOTA performance on multiple spatial reasoning benchmarks, surpassing existing training-based and tool-integrated methods by ~27%.

In recent years, social media platforms such as X have become critical environments where individuals openly disclose emotional distress and conditions associated with suicidality, creating new opportunities for early detection and intervention. Existing approaches, however, predominantly rely on raw textual content and often neglect auxiliary emotional and contextual signals embedded in user metadata. To address this limitation, we propose a Weighted Ensemble Transformer (WET), a dual branch deep learning architecture designed to identify psychiatric stressors associated with suicide in X posts. Our model integrates semantic representations extracted through Transformer encoders with an engineered feature vector capturing sentiment, subjectivity, polarity, and user engagement characteristics. We collected, filtered, and annotated 125,754 English tweets for suicide-related psychological stressors and evaluated the proposed model under two configurations. Extensive comparative experiments against traditional machine learning methods, advanced recurrent networks, and transformer baselines demonstrate that WET achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching 0.9901 accuracy in binary classification. These findings show that hybridizing deep semantic signals with auxiliary emotional and behavioral features substantially improves suicidality detection accuracy."}

Using this measure, we systematically construct evaluation scenarios in both hyper-realistic simulation and real-world and conduct extensive experimentation on manipulation policies, in particular vision-language-action (VLA) models. Our experiments highlight the significant impact of scene clutter, lowering the performance of the policies, by as much as 34% and show that despite achieving similar average performance across the tasks, different VLA policies have unique vulnerabilities and a relatively low agreement on success scenarios. We further show that our clutter measure is an effective indicator of performance degradation and analyze the impact of distractors in terms of their quantity and occluding influence. At the end, we show that finetuning on enhanced data, although effective, does not equally remedy all negative impacts of clutter on performance."}

We propose Soft-Nash Virtual Fixtures, a game-theoretic shared-control policy that softens the classic two-player linear-quadratic (LQ) Nash solution by inflating the fixture's effort weight with a single, interpretable scalar parameter $τ$. This yields a continuous dial on controller assertiveness: $τ=0$ recovers a hard, performance-focused Nash / virtual fixture controller, while larger $τ$ reduce gains and pushback, yet preserve the equilibrium structure and continuity of closed-loop stability. We derive Soft-Nash from both a KL-regularized trust-region and a maximum-entropy viewpoint, obtaining a closed-form robot best response that shrinks authority and aligns the fixture with the operator's input as $τ$ grows. We implement Soft-Nash on a 6-DoF haptic device in 3D tracking task ($n=12$). Moderate softness ($τ\\approx 1-3$, especially $τ=2$) maintains tracking error statistically indistinguishable from a tuned classic VF while sharply reducing controller-user conflict, lowering NASA-TLX workload, and increasing Sense of Agency (SoAS). A composite BalancedScore that combines normalized accuracy and non-fighting behavior peaks near $τ=2-3$. These results show that a one-parameter Soft-Nash policy can preserve accuracy while improving comfort and perceived agency, providing a practical and interpretable pathway to personalized shared control in haptics and teleoperation."}

The trajectory planning problem is formulated as a finite-horizon optimal control problem and solved using a constrained iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator (iLQR) algorithm that jointly optimizes trajectory smoothness, control effort, and risk exposure while maintaining strict feasibility. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our method outperforms traditional approaches in terms of safety and efficiency, achieving collision-free trajectories with shorter lane-changing distances (28.59 m) and times (2.84 s) while maintaining smooth and comfortable acceleration patterns.

FastDSA introduces two key components that boost efficiency: (1) automatic selection of the effective model order of the Hankel (delay) embedding from the data via a data-driven singular-value threshold that identifies the informative subspace and discards noise to lower computational cost without sacrificing signal, and (2) a novel optimization procedure and objective, which replaces the slow exact orthogonality constraint in finding a minimal distance between dynamics matrices with a lightweight process to keep the search close to the space of orthogonal transformations. We demonstrate that fastDSA is at least an order of magnitude faster than the previous methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that fastDSA has the properties of its ancestor, including its invariances and sensitivities to system dynamics. FastDSA, therefore, provides a computationally efficient and accurate method for dynamical similarity analysis."}

They assume perception outputs are fully reliable, even in ambiguous or poorly observed scenes, leaving the planner without an explicit measure of uncertainty. To address this limitation, we propose a camera-only E2E framework that estimates aleatoric uncertainty directly in BEV space and incorporates it into planning. Our method produces a dense, uncertainty-aware drivability map that captures both semantic structure and geometric layout at pixel-level resolution. To further promote safe and rule-compliant behavior, we introduce a lane-following regularization that encodes lane structure and traffic norms. This prior stabilizes trajectory planning under normal conditions while preserving the flexibility needed for maneuvers such as overtaking or lane changes. Together, these components enable robust and interpretable trajectory planning, even under challenging uncertainty conditions. Evaluated on the NAVSIM benchmark, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering substantial gains on both the challenging NAVHARD and NAVSAFE subsets. These results demonstrate that our principled aleatoric uncertainty modeling combined with driving priors significantly advances the safety and reliability of camera-only E2E autonomous driving."}

First, we characterize the conditions to preserve the original consensus, and introduce the ''accurate inference'' notion, which accounts for both the uniqueness of the solution to topology inference (solvability) and the deviation from the original topology (accuracy). Then, we employ invariant subspace analysis to characterize the solvability. Even when unique inference remains possible, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the feedback design to induce inaccurate inference, and give a Laplacian structure based distributed design.

One critical but understudied aspect is the \\textbf{potential risk} situations, where the risk is \\textbf{not yet observable} but can be inferred from subtle precursors, such as anomalous behaviors or commonsense violations. Recognizing these precursors requires strong semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities, which are often absent in current AV systems due to the scarcity of such cases in existing driving or risk-centric datasets. Moreover, current autonomous driving accident datasets often lack annotations of the causal reasoning chains behind incidents, which are essential for identifying potential risks before they become observable. To address these gaps, we introduce PotentialRiskQA, a novel vision-language dataset designed for reasoning about potential risks prior to observation. Each sample is annotated with structured scene descriptions, semantic precursors, and inferred risk outcomes. Based on this dataset, we further propose PR-Reasoner, a vision-language-model-based framework tailored for onboard potential risk reasoning.

Mentalese encodes abstract reasoning as ultra-compressed, structured tokens, enabling models to solve complex problems with far fewer steps. To improve both efficiency and accuracy, we propose SHORTER LENGTH PREFERENCE OPTIMIZATION (SLPO), a reinforcement learning method that rewards concise solutions that stay correct, while still allowing longer reasoning when needed. Applied to Mentalese-aligned models, SLPO yields significantly higher compression rates by enabling concise reasoning that preserves the benefits of detailed thinking without the computational overhead. Across benchmarks including AIME 2024 and 2025, MinervaMath, OlympiadBench, Math500, and AMC, our ORION models produce reasoning traces with 4-16x fewer tokens, achieve up to 5x lower inference latency, and reduce training costs by 7-9x relative to the DeepSeek R1 Distilled model, while maintaining 90-98% of its accuracy.

Existing policy iteration methods for optimal control must start from a stabilizing control policy, which is particularly challenging to obtain for unknown systems, especially when states are unavailable. In such cases, it is more difficult to guarantee stability and convergence performance. To address this problem, an output-feedback stabilizing policy iteration framework is developed to learn closed-loop stabilizing control policies while ensuring convergence performance. Specifically, cumulative scalar parameters are introduced to compress the original system to a stable scale. Then, by integrating modified policy iteration with parameter update rules, the system is gradually amplified/restored to the original system while preserving stability such that the stabilizing control policy is obtained. The entire process is driven solely by input-output data. Moreover, a stability analysis is provided for output-feedback. The proposed approach is validated by simulations."}

Researches of large-scale COD problem can be categorized into iterative approaches that allow DSO to dispatch independently, and non-iterative methods based on projections of feasible regions (FR). However, the iterative methods suffer from low computational convergence and efficiency, while non-iterative methods struggle to solve equivalent projections with high-dimensional FR. To address these issues, this paper proposes a TSO-DSO coordinated dispatch approach based on an accelerated non-iterative Equality Set Projection (ESP) algorithm. First, ESP algorithm is employed to overcome the bottleneck of high-dimensional FR construction. Second, an regularization-based accelerated method is proposed to reduce computational burden when degeneracy occurs. Accelerated ESP algorithm constructs projection of FR via adjacent facet searching.

By adaptively down weighting unreliable GNSS measurements, our approach improves resilience positioning. The method is implemented in an extended GTSAM framework and evaluated on the UrbanNav dataset.

We investigate whether coupling self-evaluation to reward signals creates incentives for wireheading, where agents manipulate reward measurements rather than improving task performance. We formalize conditions under which reward-channel control strictly dominates task-focused behavior in POMDPs and test these predictions empirically. Across two models and three tasks, we find that models whose self-grades determine rewards exhibit substantial grade inflation without corresponding accuracy gains, particularly on ambiguous tasks like summarization. Models that self-evaluate but do not control rewards show no such inflation. Our results demonstrate that self-evaluation is safe when decoupled from learning signals but dangerous when coupled, with clear implications for agentic system design."}

In this paper, we present a novel data-driven framework that addresses this challenge by leveraging Koopman operator theory.

Leveraging this spectral information, we systematically determine time intervals within which trajectories from the initial set are guaranteed, with a prescribed probability, to reach the target set. This enables the rigorous reachability verification without explicit computation of reachable sets, thereby offering a significant advantage in scalability and applicability. We finally validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework through case studies on representative dynamical systems."}

First, we characterize the conditions to preserve the original consensus, and introduce the ''accurate inference'' notion, which accounts for both the uniqueness of the solution to topology inference (solvability) and the deviation from the original topology (accuracy). Then, we employ invariant subspace analysis to characterize the solvability. Even when unique inference remains possible, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the feedback design to induce inaccurate inference, and give a Laplacian structure based distributed design.

We present DiskChunGS, a scalable 3DGS SLAM system that overcomes this bottleneck through an out-of-core approach that partitions scenes into spatial chunks and maintains only active regions in GPU memory while storing inactive areas on disk. Our architecture integrates seamlessly with existing SLAM frameworks for pose estimation and loop closure, enabling globally consistent reconstruction at scale.

In this paper, infrared lasers are used as optical transmitters operating in an indoor environment under eye safety regulations due to their high modulation speed. To provide efficient multiple access service, NOMA-based transmission is implemented to multiplex messages intended to multiple users in the power domain and maximize the spectral efficiency of our laser-based OWC network. In particular, a BIA outer precoder is designed to coordinate the transmission among multiple APs and determine the precoding matrices for groups of users potential formed according to NOMA principles. For effective use of NOMA, an optimization problem is formulated to maximize the sum rate of the network through forming optimum groups under certain joint conditions, efficient power allocation, high quality of service for each weak and strong users, and high overall system performance. Such optimization problems are defined as max-min fractional programs difficult to solve in practice. Therefore, a dynamic application for NOMA is introduced using two algorithms. First, a RF-aided dynamic algorithm is designed to form multiple groups, where users exchange binary variables among them through an RF system to establish distance-based weight edges, which are used as a metric for the grouping process. Second, a dynamic power allocation is proposed to determine the optimum power allocated to each group, while the users belonging to a certain group receive their traffic demands regardless of their classification as weak or strong. The results show the convergence of the proposed dynamic application to the optimum solution, and its high performance in terms of sum rate, fairness, and energy efficiency compared to counterpart schemes."}

Existing approaches primarily rely on visual reconstruction objectives while neglecting physical priors, leading to sub-optimal performance in learning universal representations. To address these challenges, we propose a Universal Latent Action Learning framework that takes task instructions and multiple frames as inputs, and optimizes both future frame reconstruction and action sequence prediction. Unlike prior works, incorporating action predictions (e.g., gripper or hand trajectories and orientations) allows the model to capture richer physical priors such as real-world distances and orientations, thereby enabling seamless transferability to downstream tasks. We further decompose the latent actions into learnable motion and scene tokens to distinguish the robot's active movements from environmental changes, thus filtering out irrelevant dynamics. By distilling the learned latent actions into the latest VLA models, we achieve strong performance across both simulated (SIMPLER and LIBERO) and real-world robot settings. Notably, with only 10 real-world trajectories per task collected on a Franka robot, our approach successfully completes all five challenging tasks, demonstrating strong few-shot transferability in robotic manipulation."}

This research highlights the role of P2P trading in efficient energy distribution and its synergy with advanced optimization techniques. While traditional rule-based methods perform well under stable conditions, they struggle in dynamic environments. To address this, Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), specifically Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Deep Q-Networks (DQN), is combined with community/distributed P2P trading mechanisms. By incorporating auction-based market clearing, a price advisor agent, and load and battery management, the approach achieves significant improvements. Results show that, compared to baseline models, DQN reduces electricity costs by 14.2% in Ireland and 5.16% in Finland, while increasing electricity revenue by 7.24% and 12.73%, respectively. PPO achieves the lowest peak hour demand, reducing it by 55.5% in Ireland, while DQN reduces peak hour demand by 50.0% in Ireland and 27.02% in Finland. These improvements are attributed to both MARL algorithms and P2P energy trading, which together results in electricity cost and peak hour demand reduction, and increase electricity selling revenue. This study highlights the complementary strengths of DQN, PPO, and P2P trading in achieving efficient, adaptable, and sustainable energy management in rural communities."}

To approach this problem, we first propose the concept of strong nonlinear detectability. This condition is sufficient and necessary for the existence of unknown input state estimators (UISEs), which reconstruct states from noisy sampled measurements and yield bounded estimation error even for unbounded unknown inputs. Based on the proposed detectability notion, a UISE is designed via a moving horizon estimation strategy using a full-order model as well as past and current measurements. Next, we tighten this detectability notion to design a two-stage MHE-based UISE, which is computationally more efficient than the MHE-based UISE using full-order models. In a simulation example with a plant growth process, both variants of MHE-based UISEs are compared with a conventional MHE to illustrate the merits of the developed methods."}

Robots employ a conjugate prior to gradually predict the times between events and derive confidence estimates to adapt their behavior.

This leads to theoretical challenges in the multi-agent setting where the non-stationarity induced by the learning of other agents demands prospective learning based on prediction models. To accurately model other agents, an agent must account for the fact that those other agents are, in turn, forming beliefs about it to predict its future behavior, motivating agents to model themselves as part of the environment. Here, building upon foundational work on universal artificial intelligence (AIXI), we introduce a mathematical framework for prospective learning and embedded agency centered on self-prediction, where Bayesian RL agents predict both future perceptual inputs and their own actions, and must therefore resolve epistemic uncertainty about themselves as part of the universe they inhabit. We show that in multi-agent settings, self-prediction enables agents to reason about others running similar algorithms, leading to new game-theoretic solution concepts and novel forms of cooperation unattainable by classical decoupled agents. Moreover, we extend the theory of AIXI, and study universally intelligent embedded agents which start from a Solomonoff prior. We show that these idealized agents can form consistent mutual predictions and achieve infinite-order theory of mind, potentially setting a gold standard for embedded multi-agent learning."}

To bridge this gap, we propose metacognitive test-time reasoning (MCTR), a framework that equips models with the ability to learn, adapt, and improve during test time through metacognitive self-updating. Inspired by the dual structure of human metacognition, MCTR comprises meta-level and object-level VLM reasoning modules, each equipped with dedicated memory systems for hierarchical adaptive reasoning. Specifically, MCTR consists of (1) a meta-reasoning module which incrementally builds a structured memory by discovering and storing task-relevant rules, environmental patterns, and action-outcome relationships from test-time observations as natural language descriptions; and (2) an action-reasoning module that determines optimal actions through context-aware perception and strategic reasoning by dynamically retrieving and integrating knowledge from memory. The action-reasoning module continuously updates its policy through proposed metacognitive test-time reinforcement learning, adapting as knowledge memory evolves. We evaluate MCTR on 45 Atari games (33 seen, 12 unseen). MCTR demonstrates robust test-time adaptation, achieving 9/12 top-1 results on unseen games compared with baselines. Analyses through ablations, learning dynamics, and case studies reveal the complementary contributions of both components and show meta-reasoning evolving toward human-like adaptation strategies."}

This difficulty mainly arises because most existing planning frameworks operate in an open-loop manner, making it hard to cope with environmental uncertainties such as wind disturbances or external perturbations. This paper presents a unified real-time navigation framework for quadrotors in unknown complex environments, based on the online construction of guiding vector fields (GVFs) from discrete reference path points. In the framework, onboard perception modules build a Euclidean Signed Distance Field (ESDF) representation of the environment, which enables obstacle awareness and path distance evaluation. The system first generates discrete, collision-free path points using a global planner, and then parameterizes them via uniform B-splines to produce a smooth and physically feasible reference trajectory. An adaptive GVF is then synthesized from the ESDF and the optimized B-spline trajectory. Unlike conventional approaches, the method adopts a closed-loop navigation paradigm, which significantly enhances robustness under external disturbances. Compared with conventional GVF methods, the proposed approach directly accommodates discretized paths and maintains compatibility with standard planning algorithms. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate improved robustness against external disturbances and superior real-time performance."}

However, GUI agents still face significant challenges in handling long-horizon tasks. First, single-agent models struggle to balance high-level capabilities and low-level execution capability, facing prevalent issues of responsibility coupling and capability conflicts. Second, agents lack awareness of the task state, leading to progress loss in long-horizon tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a staged execution-feedback reinforcement learning algorithm. Unlike training a unified policy model, we focus on training high-level scheduling models. Specifically, we propose and train two agents: a Coordinator, responsible for the strategic planning and task decomposition; and a State Tracker, responsible for context compression and information management to maintain the task's state and coherence. Based on this, we built the Coordinator-Executor-State Tracker (CES) multi-agent framework, which can be integrated with any low-level Executor model, assisting the Executor in solving long-horizon tasks through task scheduling and state management. Experiments on long-horizon task benchmarks demonstrate that CES significantly enhances the system's planning and state management capabilities. Furthermore, analysis confirms that our trained high-level scheduling module is a generalizable, plug-and-play module that significantly enhances the long-horizon capabilities of various Executors.

In this paper, we present a novel data-driven framework that addresses this challenge by leveraging Koopman operator theory. Instead of operating in the state space, the proposed method encodes model uncertainty from finite data directly into Koopman spectral representation with quantifiable error bounds. Leveraging this spectral information, we systematically determine time intervals within which trajectories from the initial set are guaranteed, with a prescribed probability, to reach the target set. This enables the rigorous reachability verification without explicit computation of reachable sets, thereby offering a significant advantage in scalability and applicability. We finally validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework through case studies on representative dynamical systems."}

However, its practical application is hindered by a critical limitation, i.e., insufficient fault tolerance against observational faults. Such faults, which appear as perturbations in the vehicles' perceived data, can substantially compromise the performance of MARL-based driving systems. Addressing this problem presents two primary challenges. One is to generate adversarial perturbations that effectively stress the policy during training, and the other is to equip vehicles with the capability to mitigate the impact of corrupted observations. To overcome the challenges, we propose a fault-tolerant MARL method for cooperative on-ramp vehicles incorporating two key agents. First, an adversarial fault injection agent is co-trained to generate perturbations that actively challenge and harden the vehicle policies. Second, we design a novel fault-tolerant vehicle agent equipped with a self-diagnosis capability, which leverages the inherent spatio-temporal correlations in vehicle state sequences to detect faults and reconstruct credible observations, thereby shielding the policy from misleading inputs. Experiments in a simulated highway merging scenario demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms baseline MARL approaches, achieving near-fault-free levels of safety and efficiency under various observation fault patterns."}

Ackermann steering further imposes curvature bounds and forbids in-place rotation, so escaping from narrow dead ends typically requires tightly sequenced forward and reverse maneuvers. Classical planners that decouple global search and local steering struggle in these settings because narrow passages occupy low-measure regions and nonholonomic reachability shrinks the set of valid connections, which degrades sampling efficiency and increases sensitivity to clearances. We study nonholonomic narrow dead-end escape for Ackermann vehicles and contribute three components. First, we construct a generator that samples multi-phase forward-reverse trajectories compatible with Ackermann kinematics and inflates their envelopes to synthesize families of narrow dead ends that are guaranteed to admit at least one feasible escape. Second, we construct a training environment that enforces kinematic constraints and train a policy using the soft actor-critic algorithm. Third, we evaluate against representative classical planners that combine global search with nonholonomic steering. Across parameterized dead-end families, the learned policy solves a larger fraction of instances, reduces maneuver count, and maintains comparable path length and planning time while under the same sensing and control limits.

Adaptive Resonance Theory-based Topological Clustering with Different Topologies (ATC-DT) builds global topological maps represented as graphs while mitigating catastrophic forgetting during sequential processing. However, its winner selection mechanism relies on an exhaustive nearest-neighbor search over all existing nodes, leading to scalability limitations as the map grows. To address this challenge, we propose a hierarchical extension called Multi-Layer ATC (MLATC). MLATC organizes nodes into a hierarchy, enabling the nearest-neighbor search to proceed from coarse to fine resolutions, thereby drastically reducing the number of distance evaluations per query. The number of layers is not fixed in advance. MLATC employs an adaptive layer addition mechanism that automatically deepens the hierarchy when lower layers become saturated, keeping the number of user-defined hyperparameters low. Simulation experiments on synthetic large-scale environments show that MLATC accelerates topological map building compared to the original ATC-DT and exhibits a sublinear, approximately logarithmic scaling of search time with respect to the number of nodes. Experiments on campus-scale real-world LiDAR datasets confirm that MLATC maintains a millisecond-level per-frame runtime and enables real-time global topological map building in large-scale environments, significantly outperforming the original ATC-DT in terms of computational efficiency."}

In this paper, infrared lasers are used as optical transmitters operating in an indoor environment under eye safety regulations due to their high modulation speed. To provide efficient multiple access service, NOMA-based transmission is implemented to multiplex messages intended to multiple users in the power domain and maximize the spectral efficiency of our laser-based OWC network. In particular, a BIA outer precoder is designed to coordinate the transmission among multiple APs and determine the precoding matrices for groups of users potential formed according to NOMA principles. For effective use of NOMA, an optimization problem is formulated to maximize the sum rate of the network through forming optimum groups under certain joint conditions, efficient power allocation, high quality of service for each weak and strong users, and high overall system performance. Such optimization problems are defined as max-min fractional programs difficult to solve in practice. Therefore, a dynamic application for NOMA is introduced using two algorithms. First, a RF-aided dynamic algorithm is designed to form multiple groups, where users exchange binary variables among them through an RF system to establish distance-based weight edges, which are used as a metric for the grouping process. Second, a dynamic power allocation is proposed to determine the optimum power allocated to each group, while the users belonging to a certain group receive their traffic demands regardless of their classification as weak or strong. The results show the convergence of the proposed dynamic application to the optimum solution, and its high performance in terms of sum rate, fairness, and energy efficiency compared to counterpart schemes."}

Existing methods fail to capture the structural information within video, and suffer from insufficient fine-grained modeling of multi-modal features. To address these issues, we are the first to introduce a new multi-modal scene graph that explicitly models the objects and their relationship as a visually grounded, structured representation of the audio-visual scene. Furthermore, we design a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network~(KAN)-based Mixture of Experts (MoE) to enhance the expressive power of the temporal integration stage. This enables more fine-grained modeling of cross-modal interactions within the question-aware fused audio-visual representation, leading to capture richer and more nuanced patterns and then improve temporal reasoning performance.

Although such workloads can be shifted over temporal and spatial horizons, it poses challenges when they cannot be accurately predicted, resulting in significant efficiency degradation and high operational cost of the energy system. The problem becomes even more difficult when the workload shifting decisions would influence their randomness, which is natural for the IDC workloads. To tackle these issues, we propose a workload classification model based on the decision-dependent uncertainty set, where the spatiotemporal elasticity of different types of random workloads are clearly identified and the decision dependencies are explicitly described as linear constraints. Thus, a mixed integer program is then established for the optimal scheduling of both workload demand and energy supply. To enhance system resilience against high volatility scenarios, a rolling horizon algorithm is developed to ensure nonanticipativity and full-scenario feasibility. Numerical tests demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits effective workload scheduling decisions with dramatic energy operational cost reductions compared to the benchmarks under most of the uncertain scenarios."}

To approach this problem, we first propose the concept of strong nonlinear detectability. This condition is sufficient and necessary for the existence of unknown input state estimators (UISEs), which reconstruct states from noisy sampled measurements and yield bounded estimation error even for unbounded unknown inputs. Based on the proposed detectability notion, a UISE is designed via a moving horizon estimation strategy using a full-order model as well as past and current measurements. Next, we tighten this detectability notion to design a two-stage MHE-based UISE, which is computationally more efficient than the MHE-based UISE using full-order models. In a simulation example with a plant growth process, both variants of MHE-based UISEs are compared with a conventional MHE to illustrate the merits of the developed methods."}

Calibration of road networks in microsimulators to reproduce ephemeral phenomena such as traffic waves for large-scale simulation is a process that is fraught with challenges. This work reconsiders the existence of the traffic state data as boundary conditions on an ego vehicle moving through previously recorded traffic data, rather than reproducing those traffic phenomena in a calibrated microsim. Our approach is to autogenerate a 1 mile highway segment corresponding to I-24, and use the I-24 data to power a cosimulation module that injects traffic information into the simulation. The CARLA and cosimulation simulations are centered around an ego vehicle sampled from the empirical data, with autogeneration of \"visible\" traffic within the longitudinal range of the ego vehicle. Boundary control beyond these visible ranges is achieved using ghost cells behind (upstream) and ahead (downstream) of the ego vehicle. Unlike prior simulation work that focuses on local car-following behavior or abstract geometries, our framework targets full time-space diagram fidelity as the validation objective. Leveraging CARLA's rich sensor suite and configurable vehicle dynamics, we simulate wave formation and dissipation in both low-congestion and high-congestion scenarios for qualitative analysis. The resulting emergent behavior closely mirrors that of real traffic, providing a novel cosimulation framework for evaluating traffic control strategies, perception-driven autonomy, and future deployment of wave mitigation solutions. Our work bridges microscopic modeling with physical experimental data, enabling the first perceptually realistic, boundary-driven simulation of empirical traffic wave phenomena in CARLA."}

However, the effectiveness of agents remains tightly coupled with the quality of training data, while curating task-specific datasets remains costly and often infeasible in real-world scenarios. Recent work has explored self-improving agents that autonomously generate, refine, and re-train on their own trajectories. A prominent line of approaches further leverages preference optimization by pairing predicted trajectories with scarce ground-truth trajectories, enabling agents to learn directly from their own failures. While these methods outperform supervised fine-tuning, their heavy reliance on predicted trajectories under limited ground-truth supervision leaves them prone to overfitting. To address this, we propose a co-evolving agents framework in which a target agent improves jointly with an auxiliary failure agent. The failure agent learns through preference optimization over failure trajectories from both the target and itself, thereby generating hard negatives that are close to success yet remain failures. Incorporating these informative hard negatives into the target agent's optimization sharpens decision boundaries and enhances generalization. Our comprehensive analysis and experiments across benchmark datasets show that our method not only shows improved performance but also demonstrates that failures, instead of being used as-is, can be systematically transformed into structured and valuable learning signals in self-improving agents."}

However, its practical application is hindered by a critical limitation, i.e., insufficient fault tolerance against observational faults. Such faults, which appear as perturbations in the vehicles' perceived data, can substantially compromise the performance of MARL-based driving systems. Addressing this problem presents two primary challenges. One is to generate adversarial perturbations that effectively stress the policy during training, and the other is to equip vehicles with the capability to mitigate the impact of corrupted observations. To overcome the challenges, we propose a fault-tolerant MARL method for cooperative on-ramp vehicles incorporating two key agents. First, an adversarial fault injection agent is co-trained to generate perturbations that actively challenge and harden the vehicle policies. Second, we design a novel fault-tolerant vehicle agent equipped with a self-diagnosis capability, which leverages the inherent spatio-temporal correlations in vehicle state sequences to detect faults and reconstruct credible observations, thereby shielding the policy from misleading inputs. Experiments in a simulated highway merging scenario demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms baseline MARL approaches, achieving near-fault-free levels of safety and efficiency under various observation fault patterns."}

A core factor underlying effective recommendation dialogue is the ability to infer and reason about users' mental states (such as desire, intention, and belief), a cognitive capacity commonly referred to as Theory of Mind. Despite growing interest in evaluating ToM in LLMs, current benchmarks predominantly rely on synthetic narratives inspired by Sally-Anne test, which emphasize physical perception and fail to capture the complexity of mental state inference in realistic conversational settings. Moreover, existing benchmarks often overlook a critical component of human ToM: behavioral prediction, the ability to use inferred mental states to guide strategic decision-making and select appropriate conversational actions for future interactions. To better align LLM-based ToM evaluation with human-like social reasoning, we propose RecToM, a novel benchmark for evaluating ToM abilities in recommendation dialogues. RecToM focuses on two complementary dimensions: Cognitive Inference and Behavioral Prediction. The former focus on understanding what has been communicated by inferring the underlying mental states. The latter emphasizes what should be done next, evaluating whether LLMs can leverage these inferred mental states to predict, select, and assess appropriate dialogue strategies. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate that RecToM poses a significant challenge. While the models exhibit partial competence in recognizing mental states, they struggle to maintain coherent, strategic ToM reasoning throughout dynamic recommendation dialogues, particularly in tracking evolving intentions and aligning conversational strategies with inferred mental states."}

This difficulty mainly arises because most existing planning frameworks operate in an open-loop manner, making it hard to cope with environmental uncertainties such as wind disturbances or external perturbations. This paper presents a unified real-time navigation framework for quadrotors in unknown complex environments, based on the online construction of guiding vector fields (GVFs) from discrete reference path points. In the framework, onboard perception modules build a Euclidean Signed Distance Field (ESDF) representation of the environment, which enables obstacle awareness and path distance evaluation. The system first generates discrete, collision-free path points using a global planner, and then parameterizes them via uniform B-splines to produce a smooth and physically feasible reference trajectory. An adaptive GVF is then synthesized from the ESDF and the optimized B-spline trajectory. Unlike conventional approaches, the method adopts a closed-loop navigation paradigm, which significantly enhances robustness under external disturbances. Compared with conventional GVF methods, the proposed approach directly accommodates discretized paths and maintains compatibility with standard planning algorithms. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate improved robustness against external disturbances and superior real-time performance."}

Integrating bio-inspired design principles into linear actuators could bring forth the next generation of adaptive and energy efficient smart material-based actuation systems. The present study amalgamates the advantages of bipenniform architecture, which generates high force in the given physiological region and a high power-to-weight ratio of shape memory alloy (SMA), into a novel bio-inspired SMA-based linear actuator. A mathematical model of a multi-layered bipenniform configuration-based SMA actuator was developed and validated experimentally. The current research also caters to the incorporation of failure mitigation strategies using design failure mode and effects analysis along with the experimental assessment of the performance of the developed actuator. The system has been benchmarked against an industry-developed stepper motor-driven actuator. It has shown promising results generating an actuation force of 257 N with 15 V input voltage, meeting the acceptable range for actuation operation. It further exhibits about 67% reduction in the weight of the drive mechanism, with 80% lesser component, 32% cost reduction, and 19% energy savings and similar envelope dimensions for assembly compatibility with dampers and louvers for easy onsite deployment. The study introduces SMA coil-based actuator as an advanced design that can be deployed for high force-high stroke applications.

Unlike conventional supervised fine-tuning, SuperIntelliAgent learns autonomously without annotation: the learner generates candidate outputs, the verifier evaluates them through step-by-step reasoning, and their interaction produces chosen/rejected pairs for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). This converts each input into a pseudo-training signal for continual improvement. The framework integrates dual-scale memory: short-term in-context memory that preserves reasoning traces across refinement cycles, and long-term memory that consolidates acquired knowledge through lightweight on-the-fly fine-tuning. A replay buffer retains samples that show verifiable progress and replays them as auxiliary supervision, reinforcing recent learning while forming adaptive curricula. SuperIntelliAgent is infrastructure-agnostic and can be plugged into existing agentic frameworks while turning ordinary inference loops into a lifelong optimization process. We posit that pairing a trainable learner with a reasoning-capable verifier forms a minimal reliable unit of growing intelligence, as paired feedback and partial-history replay yield richer learning curricula and stronger preference alignment. With a small number of automatically generated DPO pairs, the learner improves across all benchmarks, indicating that this mechanism provides a promising direction for continual intelligence accumulation and real-world deployment."}

This paper presents an AI-assisted workflow that reduces expert involvement in parameter optimization through the use of Bayesian optimization. Furthermore, we present an active learning variant of the approach, assisting the expert if desired. A deep learning model provides an initial parameter estimate, from which the optimization cycle iteratively refines the design until a termination condition (e.g., energy budget or iteration limit) is met.

Ackermann steering further imposes curvature bounds and forbids in-place rotation, so escaping from narrow dead ends typically requires tightly sequenced forward and reverse maneuvers. Classical planners that decouple global search and local steering struggle in these settings because narrow passages occupy low-measure regions and nonholonomic reachability shrinks the set of valid connections, which degrades sampling efficiency and increases sensitivity to clearances. We study nonholonomic narrow dead-end escape for Ackermann vehicles and contribute three components. First, we construct a generator that samples multi-phase forward-reverse trajectories compatible with Ackermann kinematics and inflates their envelopes to synthesize families of narrow dead ends that are guaranteed to admit at least one feasible escape. Second, we construct a training environment that enforces kinematic constraints and train a policy using the soft actor-critic algorithm. Third, we evaluate against representative classical planners that combine global search with nonholonomic steering. Across parameterized dead-end families, the learned policy solves a larger fraction of instances, reduces maneuver count, and maintains comparable path length and planning time while under the same sensing and control limits.

Existing approaches to disassembly sequence planning often assume deterministic and fully observable product models, yet real EOL products frequently deviate from their initial designs due to wear, corrosion, or undocumented repairs. We argue that disassembly should therefore be formulated as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), which naturally captures uncertainty about the product's internal state. We present a mathematical formulation of disassembly as a POMDP, in which hidden variables represent uncertain structural or physical properties. Building on this formulation, we propose a task and motion planning framework that automatically derives specific POMDP models from CAD data, robot capabilities, and inspection results. To obtain tractable policies, we approximate this formulation with a reinforcement-learning approach that operates on stochastic action outcomes informed by inspection priors, while a Bayesian filter continuously maintains beliefs over latent EOL conditions during execution. Using three products on two robotic systems, we demonstrate that this probabilistic planning framework outperforms deterministic baselines in terms of average disassembly time and variance, generalizes across different robot setups, and successfully adapts to deviations from the CAD model, such as missing or stuck parts."}

While multi-turn interaction offers a superior understanding of environmental dynamics via authentic feedback, current approaches often impose a rigid reasoning process, which constrains the model's active learning, ultimately hindering efficient world model reasoning. To address these issues, we explore world-model internalization through efficient interaction and active reasoning (WMAct), which liberates the model from structured reasoning, allowing the model to shape thinking directly through its doing, and achieves effective and efficient world model reasoning with two key mechanisms: (1) a reward rescaling mechanism adjusting outcome reward based on action efficacy to incentivize redundancy reduction and purposeful interaction; (2) an interaction frequency annealing strategy to progressively reduce the maximum allowed interaction turns, which compels the model to condense its learning and internalize environmental dynamics rather than over-relying on environmental cues. Our experiments on Sokoban, Maze, and Taxi show that WMAct yields effective world model reasoning capable of resolving tasks in a single turn that previously required multiple interactions and fosters strong transferability to complex environments, improving performance on a suite of reasoning benchmarks."}

Analogous to how knowledge-informed machine learning improves the reliability of conventional data-driven models, our framework incorporates domain-informed text gradients to guide the generative process toward physically meaningful regions of the DP composition space. Systematic comparison of three incremental configurations, (i) pure LLM generation, (ii) LLM generation with LLM reasoning-based feedback, and (iii) LLM generation with domain knowledge-guided feedback, shows that iterative guidance from knowledge-informed gradients improves stability-condition satisfaction without additional training data, achieving over 98% compositional validity and up to 54% stable or metastable candidates, surpassing both the LLM-only baseline (43%) and prior GAN-based results (27%). Analyses of ML-based gradients further reveal that they enhance performance in in-distribution (ID) regions but become unreliable in out-of-distribution (OOD) regimes.

To simultaneously account for channel assignment, input constraints, and stabilization, we formulate the control problem as a Mixed Integer Linear Programming and derive sufficient conditions for its feasibility. To improve real-time computation efficiency, we introduce an event-triggered control scheme that maintains stability even between switching events through a quadratic programming-based stabilizing controller. We theoretically establish the semi-global exponential stability of the proposed method and the asymptotic stability of its extension to nonprehensile cooperative manipulation under noninstantaneous switching.

Current state-of-the-art generative methods, such as protein language models (PLMs) and diffusion-based architectures, often require extensive fine-tuning, task-specific data, or model reconfiguration to support objective-directed design, thereby limiting their flexibility and scalability. To overcome these limitations, we present a decentralized, agent-based framework inspired by swarm intelligence for de novo protein design. In this approach, multiple large language model (LLM) agents operate in parallel, each assigned to a specific residue position. These agents iteratively propose context-aware mutations by integrating design objectives, local neighborhood interactions, and memory and feedback from previous iterations. This position-wise, decentralized coordination enables emergent design of diverse, well-defined sequences without reliance on motif scaffolds or multiple sequence alignments, validated with experiments on proteins with alpha helix and coil structures. Through analyses of residue conservation, structure-based metrics, and sequence convergence and embeddings, we demonstrate that the framework exhibits emergent behaviors and effective navigation of the protein fitness landscape. Our method achieves efficient, objective-directed designs within a few GPU-hours and operates entirely without fine-tuning or specialized training, offering a generalizable and adaptable solution for protein design.

The central limitation of current risk analysis is the inability to populate the $\\textit{catastrophic event space}$, or the set of potential large-scale harms to which probabilities might be assigned. This intractability is worsened by the $\\textit{Lucretius problem}$, or the tendency to infer future risks only from past experience. We propose a process of $\\textit{dark speculation}$, in which systematically generating and refining catastrophic scenarios (\"qualitative\" work) is coupled with estimating their likelihoods and associated damages (quantitative underwriting analysis). The idea is neither to predict the future nor to enable insurance for its own sake, but to use narrative and underwriting tools together to generate probability distributions over outcomes. We formalize this process using a simplified catastrophic Lévy stochastic framework and propose an iterative institutional design in which (1) speculation (including scenario planning) generates detailed catastrophic event narratives, (2) insurance underwriters assign probabilistic and financial parameters to these narratives, and (3) decision-makers synthesize the results into summary statistics to inform judgment. Analysis of the model reveals the value of (a) maintaining independence between speculation and underwriting, (b) analyzing multiple risk categories in parallel, and (c) generating \"thick\" catastrophic narrative rich in causal (counterfactual) and mitigative detail. While the approach cannot eliminate deep ambiguity, it offers a systematic approach to reason about extreme, low-probability events in frontier AI, tempering complacency and overreaction. The framework is adaptable for iterative use and can further augmented with AI systems."}

Ackermann steering further imposes curvature bounds and forbids in-place rotation, so escaping from narrow dead ends typically requires tightly sequenced forward and reverse maneuvers. Classical planners that decouple global search and local steering struggle in these settings because narrow passages occupy low-measure regions and nonholonomic reachability shrinks the set of valid connections, which degrades sampling efficiency and increases sensitivity to clearances. We study nonholonomic narrow dead-end escape for Ackermann vehicles and contribute three components. First, we construct a generator that samples multi-phase forward-reverse trajectories compatible with Ackermann kinematics and inflates their envelopes to synthesize families of narrow dead ends that are guaranteed to admit at least one feasible escape. Second, we construct a training environment that enforces kinematic constraints and train a policy using the soft actor-critic algorithm. Third, we evaluate against representative classical planners that combine global search with nonholonomic steering. Across parameterized dead-end families, the learned policy solves a larger fraction of instances, reduces maneuver count, and maintains comparable path length and planning time while under the same sensing and control limits.

While neural networks have demonstrated strong predictive accuracy, they often fail to preserve critical physical properties such as stability and typically assume stationary dynamics, limiting their applicability under distribution shifts. Existing approaches generally address either stability or adaptability in isolation, lacking a unified framework that ensures both. We propose LILAD (Learning In-Context Lyapunov-stable Adaptive Dynamics), a novel framework for system identification that jointly guarantees adaptability and stability. LILAD simultaneously learns a dynamics model and a Lyapunov function through in-context learning (ICL), explicitly accounting for parametric uncertainty. Trained across a diverse set of tasks, LILAD produces a stability-aware, adaptive dynamics model alongside an adaptive Lyapunov certificate. At test time, both components adapt to a new system instance using a short trajectory prompt, which enables fast generalization. To rigorously ensure stability, LILAD also computes a state-dependent attenuator that enforces a sufficient decrease condition on the Lyapunov function for any state in the new system instance. This mechanism extends stability guarantees even under out-of-distribution and out-of-task scenarios. We evaluate LILAD on benchmark autonomous systems and demonstrate that it outperforms adaptive, robust, and non-adaptive baselines in predictive accuracy."}

A Task Manager LLM interprets natural-language goals, classifies tasks, and allocates subtasks using static rules plus dynamic contexts (task, history, robot and task status, and events).Each robot runs a local LLM that composes executable Python code from primitive skills (ROS2 nodes, policies), while onboard perception (VLMs/image processing) continuously monitors events and classifies them into relevant or irrelevant to the task. Task failures or user intent changes trigger replanning, allowing robots to assist teammates, resume tasks, or request human help. Hardware studies demonstrate autonomous recovery from disruptive events, filtering of irrelevant distractions, and tightly coordinated transport with emergent human-robot cooperation (e.g., multirobot collaborative object recovery success rate: 9/10, coordinated transport: 8/8, human-assisted recovery: 5/5).Simulation studies show intention-aware replanning. A curated textual benchmark spanning 22 scenarios (3 tasks each, around 20 robots) evaluates task allocation, classification, IoU, executability, and correctness, with high average scores (e.g., correctness up to 0.91) across multiple LLMs, a separate replanning set (5 scenarios) achieves 1.0 correctness.

This gap between planning and execution is problematic for time-sensitive applications. To bridge this gap, we propose REMAP, an execution-informed MAPF planning framework that can be combined with leading search-based MAPF planners with minor changes. Our framework integrates the proposed ExecTimeNet to accurately estimate execution time based on planned paths. We demonstrate our method for solving MAPF with Real-world Deadlines (MAPF-RD) problem, where agents must reach their goals before a predefined wall-clock time.

The methodology addresses a critical gap in current practice where investment decisions rely on optimistic benefit projections without accounting for the probabilistic costs of AI-specific threats including model drift, bias-related litigation, and compliance failures under emerging regulations such as the European Union Artificial Intelligence Act and ISO/IEC 42001. Drawing on established risk quantification methods, including annual loss expectancy calculations and Monte Carlo simulation techniques, this framework enables practitioners to compute net benefits that incorporate both productivity gains and the delta between pre-implementation and post-implementation risk exposures. The analysis demonstrates that accurate AI investment evaluation requires explicit modeling of control effectiveness, reserve requirements for algorithmic failures, and the ongoing operational costs of maintaining model performance. Practical implications include specific guidance for establishing governance structures, conducting phased validations, and integrating risk-adjusted metrics into capital allocation decisions, ultimately enabling evidence-based AI portfolio management that satisfies both fiduciary responsibilities and regulatory mandates."}

We begin by showing that, despite this limitation, minimal revision is still a successful learning method in a wide range of situations. Firstly, it can learn any problem that is finitely identifiable. Secondly, it can learn with positive and negative data, as long as one considers finitely many possibilities. We then characterize the prior plausibility assignments (over finitely many possibilities) that enable one to learn via minimal revision, and do the same for conditioning and lexicographic upgrade.

However, achieving optimal performance following this regiment requires a large-scale dataset, which is costly to obtain, especially for challenging tasks, such as collision avoidance. In those tasks, generalization at test time demands coverage of many obstacles types and their spatial configurations, which are impractical to acquire purely via data. To remedy this problem, we propose Context-Aware diffusion policy via Proximal mode Expansion (CAPE), a framework that expands trajectory distribution modes with context-aware prior and guidance at inference via a novel prior-seeded iterative guided refinement procedure. The framework generates an initial trajectory plan and executes a short prefix trajectory, and then the remaining trajectory segment is perturbed to an intermediate noise level, forming a trajectory prior. Such a prior is context-aware and preserves task intent. Repeating the process with context-aware guided denoising iteratively expands mode support to allow finding smoother, less collision-prone trajectories. For collision avoidance, CAPE expands trajectory distribution modes with collision-aware context, enabling the sampling of collision-free trajectories in previously unseen environments while maintaining goal consistency. We evaluate CAPE on diverse manipulation tasks in cluttered unseen simulated and real-world settings and show up to 26% and 80% higher success rates respectively compared to SOTA methods, demonstrating better generalization to unseen environments."}

This paper quantifies the performance impact of two cost-saving measures, column-wise element grouping and 1-bit (binary) phase quantization, relative to the ideal fully-controlled, continuous-phase baseline. A single-input single-output link is simulated at 26 GHz (mmWave) across three deployment geometries that vary the relative heights of access point, IRS and user equipment. Results show that switching from continuous to binary phase control reduces median SNR gain by approximately 4 dB, while adopting column-wise grouping introduces a similar penalty; combining both constraints incurs approximately 8 dB loss under height-offset deployments. When all nodes share the same height, the degradation from column-wise control becomes negligible, indicating deployment geometry can offset control-granularity limits. Despite the losses, a 32 x 32 column-wise binary IRS still delivers double-digit SNR gains over the no-IRS baseline in most positions, confirming its viability for cost-constrained scenarios. The study provides quantitative guidelines on when simplified IRS architectures can meet link-budget targets and where full element-wise control remains justified."}

Our method minimizes out-of-distribution (OOD) gap in imitation learning by increasing visual diversity through construction of new experiences using existing demonstrations. By utilizing image generative frameworks and large language models, NICE performs three editing operations, object replacement, restyling, and removal of distracting (non-target) objects. These changes preserve spatial relationships without obstructing target objects and maintain action-label consistency. Unlike previous approaches, NICE requires no additional robot data collection, simulator access, or custom model training, making it readily applicable to existing robotic datasets.\n  Using real-world scenes, we showcase the capability of our framework in producing photo-realistic scene enhancement. For downstream tasks, we use NICE data to finetune a vision-language model (VLM) for spatial affordance prediction and a vision-language-action (VLA) policy for object manipulation. Our evaluations show that NICE successfully minimizes OOD gaps, resulting in over 20% improvement in accuracy for affordance prediction in highly cluttered scenes. For manipulation tasks, success rate increases on average by 11% when testing in environments populated with distractors in different quantities.

Using this measure, we systematically construct evaluation scenarios in both hyper-realistic simulation and real-world and conduct extensive experimentation on manipulation policies, in particular vision-language-action (VLA) models. Our experiments highlight the significant impact of scene clutter, lowering the performance of the policies, by as much as 34% and show that despite achieving similar average performance across the tasks, different VLA policies have unique vulnerabilities and a relatively low agreement on success scenarios. We further show that our clutter measure is an effective indicator of performance degradation and analyze the impact of distractors in terms of their quantity and occluding influence.

However, this progress comes at a considerable cost to the environment as training and deploying these models consume significant computational resources and energy and are responsible for large carbon footprints in the atmosphere. In this paper, we study the amount of carbon dioxide released by models across different domains over varying time periods. By examining parameters such as model size, repository activity (e.g., commits and repository age), task type, and organizational affiliation, we identify key factors influencing the environmental impact of AI development. Our findings reveal that model size and versioning frequency are strongly correlated with higher emissions, while domain-specific trends show that NLP models tend to have lower carbon footprints compared to audio-based systems. Organizational context also plays a significant role, with university-driven projects exhibiting the highest emissions, followed by non-profits and companies, while community-driven projects show a reduction in emissions. These results highlight the critical need for green AI practices, including the adoption of energy-efficient architectures, optimizing development workflows, and leveraging renewable energy sources. We also discuss a few practices that can lead to a more sustainable future with AI, and we end this paper with some future research directions that could be motivated by our work.

Our framework introduces two key innovations: (i) a Gaussian-window constrained spectral network that employs learnable Gaussian windows to highlight bot-related spectral features, and (ii) a homophily-aware adaptation mechanism that injects domain knowledge between homophily ratios and frequency features into the Gaussian window optimization process. Through extensive experimentation on multiple benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that HW-GNN achieves state-of-the-art bot detection performance, outperforming existing methods with an average improvement of 4.3% in F1-score, while exhibiting strong plug-in compatibility with existing spectral GNNs."}

In this context, optogenetics enables modulation of gene expression using light as an external input, allowing fine-tuning of protein levels to unlock dynamic metabolic control and regulation of cell growth. Optogenetic systems can be actuated by light intensity. However, relying solely on intensity-driven control (i.e., signal amplitude) may fail to properly tune optogenetic bioprocesses when the dose-response relationship (i.e., light intensity versus gene-expression strength) is steep. In these cases, tunability is effectively constrained to either fully active or fully repressed gene expression, with little intermediate regulation. Pulse-width modulation, a concept widely used in electronics, can alleviate this issue by alternating between fully ON and OFF light intensity within forcing periods, thereby smoothing the average response and enhancing process controllability. Naturally, optimizing pulse-width-modulated optogenetics entails a switching-time optimal control problem with a binary input over many forcing periods. While this can be formulated as a mixed-integer program on a refined time grid, the number of decision variables can grow rapidly with increasing time-grid resolution and number of forcing periods, compromising tractability. Here, we propose an alternative solution based on reinforcement learning. We parametrize control actions via the duty cycle, a continuous variable that encodes the ON-to-OFF switching time within each forcing period, thereby respecting the intrinsic binary nature of the light intensity."}

This paper explores preference-based learning as a data-driven approach to constructing an objective function from human preferences over trajectory pairs. We formulate the learning problem as a machine learning classification task to learn a surrogate model that estimates the likelihood of a trajectory being preferred over another. The approach provides a surrogate model that can directly be used as an MPC objective function. Numerical results show that we can learn objective functions that provide closed-loop trajectories that align with the expressed human preferences."}

To address this, we introduce Humanoid-LLA, a Large Language Action Model that maps expressive language commands to physically executable whole-body actions for humanoid robots. Our approach integrates three core components: a unified motion vocabulary that aligns human and humanoid motion primitives into a shared discrete space; a vocabulary-directed controller distilled from a privileged policy to ensure physical feasibility; and a physics-informed fine-tuning stage using reinforcement learning with dynamics-aware rewards to enhance robustness and stability. Extensive evaluations in simulation and on a real-world Unitree G1 humanoid show that Humanoid-LLA delivers strong language generalization while maintaining high physical fidelity, outperforming existing language-conditioned controllers in motion naturalness, stability, and execution success rate."}

In this work, inspired by the denoising capability of diffusion models, we invert the conventional perspective and propose a clean-to-noisy paradigm that learns to synthesize noisy depth, thereby bridging the visual sim2real gap through purely simulation-driven robotic learning. Building on this idea, we introduce RealD$^2$iff, a hierarchical coarse-to-fine diffusion framework that decomposes depth noise into global structural distortions and fine-grained local perturbations. To enable progressive learning of these components, we further develop two complementary strategies: Frequency-Guided Supervision (FGS) for global structure modeling and Discrepancy-Guided Optimization (DGO) for localized refinement. To integrate RealD$^2$iff seamlessly into imitation learning, we construct a pipeline that spans six stages. We provide comprehensive empirical and experimental validation demonstrating the effectiveness of this paradigm. RealD$^2$iff enables two key applications: (1) generating real-world-like depth to construct clean-noisy paired datasets without manual sensor data collection. (2) Achieving zero-shot sim2real robot manipulation, substantially improving real-world performance without additional fine-tuning."}

We attribute this variability to the mixed-quality nature of human demonstrations, where the implicit principles that govern how actions should be carried out are only partially satisfied. To address this challenge, we introduce the LIBERO-Elegant benchmark with explicit criteria for evaluating execution quality. Using these criteria, we develop a decoupled refinement framework that improves execution quality without modifying or retraining the base VLA policy. We formalize Elegant Execution as the satisfaction of Implicit Task Constraints (ITCs) and train an Elegance Critic via offline Calibrated Q-Learning to estimate the expected quality of candidate actions. At inference time, a Just-in-Time Intervention (JITI) mechanism monitors critic confidence and intervenes only at decision-critical moments, providing selective, on-demand refinement. Experiments on LIBERO-Elegant and real-world manipulation tasks show that the learned Elegance Critic substantially improves execution quality, even on unseen tasks.

Across multiple datasets and query structures, we find several cases where neural and relaxation-based approaches perform similarly, with no neural model consistently outperforming the latter. Moreover, a similarity analysis reveals that their retrieved answers exhibit little overlap, and that combining their outputs consistently improves performance.

By scaling reasoning with reinforcement learning that rewards correct final answers, LLMs have improved from poor performance to saturating quantitative reasoning competitions like AIME and HMMT in one year. However, this approach faces fundamental limitations. Pursuing higher final answer accuracy doesn't address a key issue: correct answers don't guarantee correct reasoning. Moreover, many mathematical tasks like theorem proving require rigorous step-by-step derivation rather than numerical answers, making final answer rewards inapplicable. To push the limits of deep reasoning, we believe it is necessary to verify the comprehensiveness and rigor of mathematical reasoning. Self-verification is particularly important for scaling test-time compute, especially for open problems without known solutions. Towards self-verifiable mathematical reasoning, we investigate how to train an accurate and faithful LLM-based verifier for theorem proving. We then train a proof generator using the verifier as the reward model, and incentivize the generator to identify and resolve as many issues as possible in their own proofs before finalizing them. To maintain the generation-verification gap as the generator becomes stronger, we propose to scale verification compute to automatically label new hard-to-verify proofs, creating training data to further improve the verifier. Our resulting model, DeepSeekMath-V2, demonstrates strong theorem-proving capabilities, achieving gold-level scores on IMO 2025 and CMO 2024 and a near-perfect 118/120 on Putnam 2024 with scaled test-time compute."}

First, we identify a formal definition of AI deception, grounded in signaling theory from studies of animal deception. We then review existing empirical studies and associated risks, highlighting deception as a sociotechnical safety challenge. We organize the landscape of AI deception research as a deception cycle, consisting of two key components: deception emergence and deception treatment. Deception emergence reveals the mechanisms underlying AI deception: systems with sufficient capability and incentive potential inevitably engage in deceptive behaviors when triggered by external conditions. Deception treatment, in turn, focuses on detecting and addressing such behaviors. On deception emergence, we analyze incentive foundations across three hierarchical levels and identify three essential capability preconditions required for deception. We further examine contextual triggers, including supervision gaps, distributional shifts, and environmental pressures. On deception treatment, we conclude detection methods covering benchmarks and evaluation protocols in static and interactive settings. Building on the three core factors of deception emergence, we outline potential mitigation strategies and propose auditing approaches that integrate technical, community, and governance efforts to address sociotechnical challenges and future AI risks.

Tool-integrated methods constrain the final computation but critically leave the VLM's planning process unconstrained, resulting in geometrically flawed plans. In this work, we propose Geometrically-Constrained Agent (GCA), a training-free agentic paradigm that resolves this gap by introducing a formal task constraint. Specifically, we strategically decouples the VLM's role into two stages. First, acting as a semantic analyst, the VLM translates the user's ambiguous query into the formal, verifiable task constraint, which defines the reference frame and objective. Second, acting as a task solver, the VLM generates and executes tool calls strictly within the deterministic bounds defined by the constraint. This geometrically-constrained reasoning strategy successfully resolve the semantic-to-geometric gap, yielding a robust and verifiable reasoning pathway for spatial reasoning.

Inspired by functional specificity in neuroscience, we hypothesize that it is more effective to finetune sparse model representations specific to a given task.

LIBs have high energy density, long cycle life, and favorable safety record. They also have low noise, heat, and emission footprints. This fosters a conducive workplace environment for underground mining personnel. However, many occurrences of LIB failure have resulted in dangerous situations in underground mines. The combustion products, including toxic emissions, can rapidly travel throughout the mine using the ventilation network. Therefore, it is critical to monitor the temperature and smoke concentration underground at all times to ensure the safety of the miners. High-fidelity models can be developed for specific scenarios of LIB failure, but are computationally prohibitive for large underground mine volumes, complex geometries, and long duration combustion events.

To navigate computational complexity, power system dynamic models are often reduced using techniques based on singular perturbation.

This work proposes two singular perturbation approaches that aim to optimally identify fast states that shall be reduced, without prior knowledge about the physical meaning of system states. After presenting a timescale-agnostic formulation for singular perturbation, the first approach uses greedy optimization to sequentially select states to be reduced.

This work introduces a method that enables LLMs to process and utilize tool responses of arbitrary length without loss of information. By shifting the model's interaction from raw data to memory pointers, the method preserves tool functionality, allows seamless integration into agentic workflows, and reduces token usage and execution time. The proposed method is validated on a real-world Materials Science application that cannot be executed with conventional workflows, and its effectiveness is demonstrated via a comparative analysis where both methods succeed.

The system will use a multi-layer structure; it will include an Application and Interface Layer, an Agents Layer, and a Data Source Layer to provide adaptive, transparent, and inclusive support. Fundamentally, a hybrid reasoning engine will synchronize four special-purpose agents, which include: a personalized-nutrition-based, called a Meal Planner Agent; an adaptive-scheduling-based, called a Reminder Agent; interactive assistance during grocery shopping and cooking, called a Food Guidance Agent; and a continuous-intake-and-physiological-tracking, called a Monitoring Agent. All the agents interact through a central communicative system called the Blackboard/Event Bus, which allows autonomous interaction and real-time feedback loops with multimedia user interfaces. Privacy-sensitive data sources, including electronic health records (EHRs), nutritional databases, wearable sensors, and smart kitchen Internet of Things, are also included in the framework and placed into a policy-controlled layer, which ensures data safety and compliance with consent. Collaborative care and clinician dashboards allow common supervision, and discussable artificial intelligence (XAI) modules give brief explanations of why a decision was made, making users responsible and reliant. The proposed agentic AI framework is an extension beyond traditional assistive systems since it incorporates inclusiveness, personalization, and accessibility at all levels.

Yet, these methods mostly rely on egocentric (first-person) perception, limiting their performance, especially when the viewpoint of the robot is occluded. A promising solution would be to enhance the robot's environmental awareness by using complementary viewpoints, such as multiple actors exchanging perceptual information. Inspired by this idea, this work proposes a multi-view depth-based locomotion framework that combines egocentric and exocentric observations to provide richer environmental context during agile locomotion. Using a teacher-student distillation approach, the student policy learns to fuse proprioception with dual depth streams while remaining robust to real-world sensing imperfections. To further improve robustness, we introduce extensive domain randomization, including stochastic remote-camera dropouts and 3D positional perturbations that emulate aerial-ground cooperative sensing. Simulation results show that multi-viewpoints policies outperform single-viewpoint baseline in gap crossing, step descent, and other dynamic maneuvers, while maintaining stability when the exocentric camera is partially or completely unavailable. Additional experiments show that moderate viewpoint misalignment is well tolerated when incorporated during training. This study demonstrates that heterogeneous visual feedback improves robustness and agility in quadrupedal locomotion.

However, achieving optimal performance following this regiment requires a large-scale dataset, which is costly to obtain, especially for challenging tasks, such as collision avoidance. In those tasks, generalization at test time demands coverage of many obstacles types and their spatial configurations, which are impractical to acquire purely via data. To remedy this problem, we propose Context-Aware diffusion policy via Proximal mode Expansion (CAPE), a framework that expands trajectory distribution modes with context-aware prior and guidance at inference via a novel prior-seeded iterative guided refinement procedure. The framework generates an initial trajectory plan and executes a short prefix trajectory, and then the remaining trajectory segment is perturbed to an intermediate noise level, forming a trajectory prior. Such a prior is context-aware and preserves task intent. Repeating the process with context-aware guided denoising iteratively expands mode support to allow finding smoother, less collision-prone trajectories. For collision avoidance, CAPE expands trajectory distribution modes with collision-aware context, enabling the sampling of collision-free trajectories in previously unseen environments while maintaining goal consistency. We evaluate CAPE on diverse manipulation tasks in cluttered unseen simulated and real-world settings and show up to 26% and 80% higher success rates respectively compared to SOTA methods, demonstrating better generalization to unseen environments."}

In this work, we propose an effective and scalable framework, Naturalistic Inpainting for Context Enhancement (NICE). Our method minimizes out-of-distribution (OOD) gap in imitation learning by increasing visual diversity through construction of new experiences using existing demonstrations. By utilizing image generative frameworks and large language models, NICE performs three editing operations, object replacement, restyling, and removal of distracting (non-target) objects. These changes preserve spatial relationships without obstructing target objects and maintain action-label consistency. Unlike previous approaches, NICE requires no additional robot data collection, simulator access, or custom model training, making it readily applicable to existing robotic datasets.\n  Using real-world scenes, we showcase the capability of our framework in producing photo-realistic scene enhancement. For downstream tasks, we use NICE data to finetune a vision-language model (VLM) for spatial affordance prediction and a vision-language-action (VLA) policy for object manipulation. Our evaluations show that NICE successfully minimizes OOD gaps, resulting in over 20% improvement in accuracy for affordance prediction in highly cluttered scenes. For manipulation tasks, success rate increases on average by 11% when testing in environments populated with distractors in different quantities.

Using this measure, we systematically construct evaluation scenarios in both hyper-realistic simulation and real-world and conduct extensive experimentation on manipulation policies, in particular vision-language-action (VLA) models. Our experiments highlight the significant impact of scene clutter, lowering the performance of the policies, by as much as 34% and show that despite achieving similar average performance across the tasks, different VLA policies have unique vulnerabilities and a relatively low agreement on success scenarios. We further show that our clutter measure is an effective indicator of performance degradation and analyze the impact of distractors in terms of their quantity and occluding influence. At the end, we show that finetuning on enhanced data, although effective, does not equally remedy all negative impacts of clutter on performance."}

In this paper, we study the amount of carbon dioxide released by models across different domains over varying time periods. By examining parameters such as model size, repository activity (e.g., commits and repository age), task type, and organizational affiliation, we identify key factors influencing the environmental impact of AI development. Our findings reveal that model size and versioning frequency are strongly correlated with higher emissions, while domain-specific trends show that NLP models tend to have lower carbon footprints compared to audio-based systems. Organizational context also plays a significant role, with university-driven projects exhibiting the highest emissions, followed by non-profits and companies, while community-driven projects show a reduction in emissions. These results highlight the critical need for green AI practices, including the adoption of energy-efficient architectures, optimizing development workflows, and leveraging renewable energy sources. We also discuss a few practices that can lead to a more sustainable future with AI, and we end this paper with some future research directions that could be motivated by our work.

To simultaneously account for channel assignment, input constraints, and stabilization, we formulate the control problem as a Mixed Integer Linear Programming and derive sufficient conditions for its feasibility. To improve real-time computation efficiency, we introduce an event-triggered control scheme that maintains stability even between switching events through a quadratic programming-based stabilizing controller. We theoretically establish the semi-global exponential stability of the proposed method and the asymptotic stability of its extension to nonprehensile cooperative manipulation under noninstantaneous switching. The proposed framework is further validated through numerical simulations on 2D and 3D free-flyer systems and multi-robot nonprehensile pushing tasks."}

Traditional similarity measures ignore the dynamical processes underlying neural representations. Dynamical similarity methods offer a framework to compare the temporal structure of dynamical systems by embedding their (possibly) nonlinear dynamics into a globally linear space and there computing conjugacy metrics. However, identifying the best embedding and computing these metrics can be computationally slow. Here we introduce fast Dynamical Similarity Analysis (fastDSA), which is computationally far more efficient than previous methods while maintaining their accuracy and robustness. FastDSA introduces two key components that boost efficiency: (1) automatic selection of the effective model order of the Hankel (delay) embedding from the data via a data-driven singular-value threshold that identifies the informative subspace and discards noise to lower computational cost without sacrificing signal, and (2) a novel optimization procedure and objective, which replaces the slow exact orthogonality constraint in finding a minimal distance between dynamics matrices with a lightweight process to keep the search close to the space of orthogonal transformations. We demonstrate that fastDSA is at least an order of magnitude faster than the previous methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that fastDSA has the properties of its ancestor, including its invariances and sensitivities to system dynamics. FastDSA, therefore, provides a computationally efficient and accurate method for dynamical similarity analysis."}

We first construct a dynamic risk fields (DRF) that captures both the static and dynamic collision risks from surrounding vehicles. Then, we develop a rigorous strategy for generating time-varying convex feasible spaces that ensure kinematic feasibility and safety requirements. The trajectory planning problem is formulated as a finite-horizon optimal control problem and solved using a constrained iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator (iLQR) algorithm that jointly optimizes trajectory smoothness, control effort, and risk exposure while maintaining strict feasibility. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our method outperforms traditional approaches in terms of safety and efficiency, achieving collision-free trajectories with shorter lane-changing distances (28.59 m) and times (2.84 s) while maintaining smooth and comfortable acceleration patterns. In dense roundabout environments the planner further demonstrates robust adaptability, producing larger safety margins, lower jerk, and superior curvature smoothness compared with APF, MPC, and RRT based baselines. These results confirm that the integrated DRF with convex feasible space and constrained iLQR solver provides a balanced solution for safe, efficient, and comfortable trajectory generation in dynamic and interactive traffic scenarios."}

To bridge this gap, this work proposes a novel E2E learning based RSE framework, where the RSE problem is innovatively constructed as an explicit differentiable layer of NN for the first time, ensuring physics alignments with rigors. Also, the measurement weights are treated as learnable parameters of NN to enhance estimation robustness. A hybrid loss function is formulated to pursue accurate and physically consistent solutions. To realize the proposed NN structure, the original non-convex RSE problem is specially relaxed. Extensive numerical simulations have been carried out to demonstrate that the proposed framework can significantly improve the SE performance while fulfilling physical consistency on six testing systems, in comparisons to the classical E2E learning based approach and the physics-informed neural network (PINN) approach."}

Mentalese encodes abstract reasoning as ultra-compressed, structured tokens, enabling models to solve complex problems with far fewer steps. To improve both efficiency and accuracy, we propose SHORTER LENGTH PREFERENCE OPTIMIZATION (SLPO), a reinforcement learning method that rewards concise solutions that stay correct, while still allowing longer reasoning when needed.

In this context, optogenetics enables modulation of gene expression using light as an external input, allowing fine-tuning of protein levels to unlock dynamic metabolic control and regulation of cell growth. Optogenetic systems can be actuated by light intensity. However, relying solely on intensity-driven control (i.e., signal amplitude) may fail to properly tune optogenetic bioprocesses when the dose-response relationship (i.e., light intensity versus gene-expression strength) is steep. In these cases, tunability is effectively constrained to either fully active or fully repressed gene expression, with little intermediate regulation. Pulse-width modulation, a concept widely used in electronics, can alleviate this issue by alternating between fully ON and OFF light intensity within forcing periods, thereby smoothing the average response and enhancing process controllability. Naturally, optimizing pulse-width-modulated optogenetics entails a switching-time optimal control problem with a binary input over many forcing periods. While this can be formulated as a mixed-integer program on a refined time grid, the number of decision variables can grow rapidly with increasing time-grid resolution and number of forcing periods, compromising tractability. Here, we propose an alternative solution based on reinforcement learning. We parametrize control actions via the duty cycle, a continuous variable that encodes the ON-to-OFF switching time within each forcing period, thereby respecting the intrinsic binary nature of the light intensity."}

To address these gaps, we introduce PotentialRiskQA, a novel vision-language dataset designed for reasoning about potential risks prior to observation. Each sample is annotated with structured scene descriptions, semantic precursors, and inferred risk outcomes. Based on this dataset, we further propose PR-Reasoner, a vision-language-model-based framework tailored for onboard potential risk reasoning. Experimental results show that fine-tuning on PotentialRiskQA enables PR-Reasoner to significantly enhance its performance on the potential risk reasoning task compared to baseline VLMs. Together, our dataset and model provide a foundation for developing autonomous systems with improved foresight and proactive safety capabilities, moving toward more intelligent and resilient AVs."}

Drawing on Said's Orientalism and framing theory, we introduce Visual Orientalism -- the dual standard whereby AI depicts Western nations through political-modern symbols while portraying Eastern nations through cultural-traditional symbols. Analyzing 396 AI-generated images across 12 countries and 3 models, we reveal an evolution: Visual Orientalism has shifted from traditional West-versus-East binaries to English-language centrism, where only English-speaking core countries (USA and UK) receive political representation while all other nations -- including European powers -- face cultural exoticization. This algorithmic reconfiguration of Orientalism operates through automated framing mechanisms shaped by the material conditions of AI development: English-language training data dominance and the concentration of AI development in English-speaking tech companies. Our findings demonstrate how AI systems function as agents of cultural representation that perpetuate and intensify historical power asymmetries. Addressing Visual Orientalism requires rethinking of algorithmic governance and the geopolitical structures embedded in AI training data."}

To address this, we introduce Humanoid-LLA, a Large Language Action Model that maps expressive language commands to physically executable whole-body actions for humanoid robots. Our approach integrates three core components: a unified motion vocabulary that aligns human and humanoid motion primitives into a shared discrete space; a vocabulary-directed controller distilled from a privileged policy to ensure physical feasibility; and a physics-informed fine-tuning stage using reinforcement learning with dynamics-aware rewards to enhance robustness and stability. Extensive evaluations in simulation and on a real-world Unitree G1 humanoid show that Humanoid-LLA delivers strong language generalization while maintaining high physical fidelity, outperforming existing language-conditioned controllers in motion naturalness, stability, and execution success rate."}

To bridge this gap, we introduce TIM-PRM (Tool-Integrated Multimodal PRM), a novel agentic framework that transforms verification from a passive classification task into an active, tool-augmented investigation. TIM-PRM is trained to explicitly plan verification strategies and utilizes a mechanism of Independent Question Asking to query evidence via external tools, effectively decoupling verification from the reasoning context to eliminate confirmation bias. We instantiate this method by curating a high-quality dataset of tool-integrated verification trajectories. Extensive experiments on VisualProcessBench demonstrate that our 8B parameter model surpasses existing open-source multimodal PRMs, significantly outperforming much larger models like Qwen2.5-72B and InternVL-78B, while offering interpretable insights into the verification process."}

In this work, we focus on closed-loop orbit raising rather than offline trajectory planning and address the stability limitations of the Q-law through a Lyapunov based control design. A Lyapunov-guided modification of the classical Q-law is proposed to ensure closed-loop stability and enable real-time implementation.

First, we characterize the conditions to preserve the original consensus, and introduce the ''accurate inference'' notion, which accounts for both the uniqueness of the solution to topology inference (solvability) and the deviation from the original topology (accuracy). Then, we employ invariant subspace analysis to characterize the solvability. Even when unique inference remains possible, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the feedback design to induce inaccurate inference, and give a Laplacian structure based distributed design.

We present DiskChunGS, a scalable 3DGS SLAM system that overcomes this bottleneck through an out-of-core approach that partitions scenes into spatial chunks and maintains only active regions in GPU memory while storing inactive areas on disk. Our architecture integrates seamlessly with existing SLAM frameworks for pose estimation and loop closure, enabling globally consistent reconstruction at scale.

Existing approaches primarily rely on visual reconstruction objectives while neglecting physical priors, leading to sub-optimal performance in learning universal representations. To address these challenges, we propose a Universal Latent Action Learning framework that takes task instructions and multiple frames as inputs, and optimizes both future frame reconstruction and action sequence prediction. Unlike prior works, incorporating action predictions (e.g., gripper or hand trajectories and orientations) allows the model to capture richer physical priors such as real-world distances and orientations, thereby enabling seamless transferability to downstream tasks. We further decompose the latent actions into learnable motion and scene tokens to distinguish the robot's active movements from environmental changes, thus filtering out irrelevant dynamics. By distilling the learned latent actions into the latest VLA models, we achieve strong performance across both simulated (SIMPLER and LIBERO) and real-world robot settings.

This research highlights the role of P2P trading in efficient energy distribution and its synergy with advanced optimization techniques. While traditional rule-based methods perform well under stable conditions, they struggle in dynamic environments. To address this, Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), specifically Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Deep Q-Networks (DQN), is combined with community/distributed P2P trading mechanisms. By incorporating auction-based market clearing, a price advisor agent, and load and battery management, the approach achieves significant improvements. Results show that, compared to baseline models, DQN reduces electricity costs by 14.2% in Ireland and 5.16% in Finland, while increasing electricity revenue by 7.24% and 12.73%, respectively. PPO achieves the lowest peak hour demand, reducing it by 55.5% in Ireland, while DQN reduces peak hour demand by 50.0% in Ireland and 27.02% in Finland. These improvements are attributed to both MARL algorithms and P2P energy trading, which together results in electricity cost and peak hour demand reduction, and increase electricity selling revenue. This study highlights the complementary strengths of DQN, PPO, and P2P trading in achieving efficient, adaptable, and sustainable energy management in rural communities."}

However, its practical application is hindered by a critical limitation, i.e., insufficient fault tolerance against observational faults. Such faults, which appear as perturbations in the vehicles' perceived data, can substantially compromise the performance of MARL-based driving systems. Addressing this problem presents two primary challenges. One is to generate adversarial perturbations that effectively stress the policy during training, and the other is to equip vehicles with the capability to mitigate the impact of corrupted observations. To overcome the challenges, we propose a fault-tolerant MARL method for cooperative on-ramp vehicles incorporating two key agents. First, an adversarial fault injection agent is co-trained to generate perturbations that actively challenge and harden the vehicle policies. Second, we design a novel fault-tolerant vehicle agent equipped with a self-diagnosis capability, which leverages the inherent spatio-temporal correlations in vehicle state sequences to detect faults and reconstruct credible observations, thereby shielding the policy from misleading inputs. Experiments in a simulated highway merging scenario demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms baseline MARL approaches, achieving near-fault-free levels of safety and efficiency under various observation fault patterns."}

Calibration of road networks in microsimulators to reproduce ephemeral phenomena such as traffic waves for large-scale simulation is a process that is fraught with challenges. This work reconsiders the existence of the traffic state data as boundary conditions on an ego vehicle moving through previously recorded traffic data, rather than reproducing those traffic phenomena in a calibrated microsim. Our approach is to autogenerate a 1 mile highway segment corresponding to I-24, and use the I-24 data to power a cosimulation module that injects traffic information into the simulation. The CARLA and cosimulation simulations are centered around an ego vehicle sampled from the empirical data, with autogeneration of \"visible\" traffic within the longitudinal range of the ego vehicle. Boundary control beyond these visible ranges is achieved using ghost cells behind (upstream) and ahead (downstream) of the ego vehicle. Unlike prior simulation work that focuses on local car-following behavior or abstract geometries, our framework targets full time-space diagram fidelity as the validation objective. Leveraging CARLA's rich sensor suite and configurable vehicle dynamics, we simulate wave formation and dissipation in both low-congestion and high-congestion scenarios for qualitative analysis. The resulting emergent behavior closely mirrors that of real traffic, providing a novel cosimulation framework for evaluating traffic control strategies, perception-driven autonomy, and future deployment of wave mitigation solutions. Our work bridges microscopic modeling with physical experimental data, enabling the first perceptually realistic, boundary-driven simulation of empirical traffic wave phenomena in CARLA."}

In contrast, humans leverage the metacognitive model with memory, enabling continuous strategy refinement through metacognitive control when faced with new challenges. To bridge this gap, we propose metacognitive test-time reasoning (MCTR), a framework that equips models with the ability to learn, adapt, and improve during test time through metacognitive self-updating. Inspired by the dual structure of human metacognition, MCTR comprises meta-level and object-level VLM reasoning modules, each equipped with dedicated memory systems for hierarchical adaptive reasoning. Specifically, MCTR consists of (1) a meta-reasoning module which incrementally builds a structured memory by discovering and storing task-relevant rules, environmental patterns, and action-outcome relationships from test-time observations as natural language descriptions; and (2) an action-reasoning module that determines optimal actions through context-aware perception and strategic reasoning by dynamically retrieving and integrating knowledge from memory. The action-reasoning module continuously updates its policy through proposed metacognitive test-time reinforcement learning, adapting as knowledge memory evolves. We evaluate MCTR on 45 Atari games (33 seen, 12 unseen). MCTR demonstrates robust test-time adaptation, achieving 9/12 top-1 results on unseen games compared with baselines. Analyses through ablations, learning dynamics, and case studies reveal the complementary contributions of both components and show meta-reasoning evolving toward human-like adaptation strategies."}

Leveraging this spectral information, we systematically determine time intervals within which trajectories from the initial set are guaranteed, with a prescribed probability, to reach the target set. This enables the rigorous reachability verification without explicit computation of reachable sets, thereby offering a significant advantage in scalability and applicability.

In this paper, infrared lasers are used as optical transmitters operating in an indoor environment under eye safety regulations due to their high modulation speed. To provide efficient multiple access service, NOMA-based transmission is implemented to multiplex messages intended to multiple users in the power domain and maximize the spectral efficiency of our laser-based OWC network. In particular, a BIA outer precoder is designed to coordinate the transmission among multiple APs and determine the precoding matrices for groups of users potential formed according to NOMA principles. For effective use of NOMA, an optimization problem is formulated to maximize the sum rate of the network through forming optimum groups under certain joint conditions, efficient power allocation, high quality of service for each weak and strong users, and high overall system performance. Such optimization problems are defined as max-min fractional programs difficult to solve in practice. Therefore, a dynamic application for NOMA is introduced using two algorithms. First, a RF-aided dynamic algorithm is designed to form multiple groups, where users exchange binary variables among them through an RF system to establish distance-based weight edges, which are used as a metric for the grouping process. Second, a dynamic power allocation is proposed to determine the optimum power allocated to each group, while the users belonging to a certain group receive their traffic demands regardless of their classification as weak or strong. The results show the convergence of the proposed dynamic application to the optimum solution, and its high performance in terms of sum rate, fairness, and energy efficiency compared to counterpart schemes."}

The present study amalgamates the advantages of bipenniform architecture, which generates high force in the given physiological region and a high power-to-weight ratio of shape memory alloy (SMA), into a novel bio-inspired SMA-based linear actuator. A mathematical model of a multi-layered bipenniform configuration-based SMA actuator was developed and validated experimentally. The current research also caters to the incorporation of failure mitigation strategies using design failure mode and effects analysis along with the experimental assessment of the performance of the developed actuator. The system has been benchmarked against an industry-developed stepper motor-driven actuator. It has shown promising results generating an actuation force of 257 N with 15 V input voltage, meeting the acceptable range for actuation operation. It further exhibits about 67% reduction in the weight of the drive mechanism, with 80% lesser component, 32% cost reduction, and 19% energy savings and similar envelope dimensions for assembly compatibility with dampers and louvers for easy onsite deployment.

Existing approaches to disassembly sequence planning often assume deterministic and fully observable product models, yet real EOL products frequently deviate from their initial designs due to wear, corrosion, or undocumented repairs. We argue that disassembly should therefore be formulated as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), which naturally captures uncertainty about the product's internal state. We present a mathematical formulation of disassembly as a POMDP, in which hidden variables represent uncertain structural or physical properties. Building on this formulation, we propose a task and motion planning framework that automatically derives specific POMDP models from CAD data, robot capabilities, and inspection results. To obtain tractable policies, we approximate this formulation with a reinforcement-learning approach that operates on stochastic action outcomes informed by inspection priors, while a Bayesian filter continuously maintains beliefs over latent EOL conditions during execution. Using three products on two robotic systems, we demonstrate that this probabilistic planning framework outperforms deterministic baselines in terms of average disassembly time and variance, generalizes across different robot setups, and successfully adapts to deviations from the CAD model, such as missing or stuck parts."}

Unlike conventional supervised fine-tuning, SuperIntelliAgent learns autonomously without annotation: the learner generates candidate outputs, the verifier evaluates them through step-by-step reasoning, and their interaction produces chosen/rejected pairs for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). This converts each input into a pseudo-training signal for continual improvement. The framework integrates dual-scale memory: short-term in-context memory that preserves reasoning traces across refinement cycles, and long-term memory that consolidates acquired knowledge through lightweight on-the-fly fine-tuning. A replay buffer retains samples that show verifiable progress and replays them as auxiliary supervision, reinforcing recent learning while forming adaptive curricula. SuperIntelliAgent is infrastructure-agnostic and can be plugged into existing agentic frameworks while turning ordinary inference loops into a lifelong optimization process. We posit that pairing a trainable learner with a reasoning-capable verifier forms a minimal reliable unit of growing intelligence, as paired feedback and partial-history replay yield richer learning curricula and stronger preference alignment. With a small number of automatically generated DPO pairs, the learner improves across all benchmarks, indicating that this mechanism provides a promising direction for continual intelligence accumulation and real-world deployment."}

While multi-turn interaction offers a superior understanding of environmental dynamics via authentic feedback, current approaches often impose a rigid reasoning process, which constrains the model's active learning, ultimately hindering efficient world model reasoning. To address these issues, we explore world-model internalization through efficient interaction and active reasoning (WMAct), which liberates the model from structured reasoning, allowing the model to shape thinking directly through its doing, and achieves effective and efficient world model reasoning with two key mechanisms: (1) a reward rescaling mechanism adjusting outcome reward based on action efficacy to incentivize redundancy reduction and purposeful interaction; (2) an interaction frequency annealing strategy to progressively reduce the maximum allowed interaction turns, which compels the model to condense its learning and internalize environmental dynamics rather than over-relying on environmental cues. Our experiments on Sokoban, Maze, and Taxi show that WMAct yields effective world model reasoning capable of resolving tasks in a single turn that previously required multiple interactions and fosters strong transferability to complex environments, improving performance on a suite of reasoning benchmarks."}

While Spain integrated into dense European institutional architectures, Uruguay remained embedded within the Latin American governance regime, characterized by weaker coordination and lower institutional coherence. To assess how alternative institutional embeddings could have altered these paths, the study develops a generative counterfactual framework grounded in economic complexity, institutional path dependence, and a Wasserstein GAN trained on data from 1960-2020. The resulting Expected Developmental Shift (EDS) quantifies structural gains or losses from hypothetical re-embedding in different institutional ecosystems. Counterfactual simulations indicate that Spain would have experienced significant developmental decline under a Latin American configuration, while Uruguay would have achieved higher complexity and resilience within a European regime. These findings suggest that development is not solely determined by domestic reforms but emerges from a country's structural position within transnational institutional networks."}

Reidpath"], "title": "The Causal Uncertainty Principle", "comment": "7 pages, 2 figures, including supplementary material", "summary": "This paper explains why internal and external validity cannot be simultaneously maximised. It introduces \"evidential states\" to represent the information available for causal inference and shows that routine study operations (restriction, conditioning, and intervention) transform these states in ways that do not commute. Because each operation removes or reorganises information differently, changing their order yields evidential states that support different causal claims. This non-commutativity creates a structural trade-off: the steps that secure precise causal identification also eliminate the heterogeneity required for generalisation. Small model, observational and experimental examples illustrate how familiar failures of transportability arise from this order dependence. The result is a concise structural account of why increasing causal precision necessarily narrows the world to which findings apply."}
