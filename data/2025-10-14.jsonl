We adopt inverse probability\nweighting (IPW) for identification; however, IPW-transformed outcomes are known\nto be noisy, even when true propensity scores are used. To address this issue,\nwe introduce a noise reduction procedure and estimate a linear CATE model using\nLasso, achieving both accuracy and interpretability. We theoretically show that\ndenoising reduces the prediction error of the Lasso. The method is particularly\neffective when treatment effects are small relative to the variability of\noutcomes, which is often the case in empirical applications. Applications to\nthe Get-Out-the-Vote dataset and Criteo Uplift Modeling dataset demonstrate\nthat our method outperforms fully nonparametric machine learning methods in\nidentifying individuals with higher treatment effects.

Under a\nnovel identifying assumption, association similarity, which requires the\ndependence between unobserved factors and potential outcomes to be invariant\nacross treatment states, we achieve point identification of the full\ndistribution of potential outcomes. Recognizing that this assumption may be\nstrong in some contexts, we propose two weaker alternatives: monotonic\nassociation, which restricts the direction of selection heterogeneity, and\nbounded association, which constrains its magnitude. These relaxed assumptions\ndeliver sharp partial identification bounds that nest point identification as a\nspecial case and facilitate transparent sensitivity analysis.

While numerous benchmarks measure agent accuracy across domains,\nthey mostly assume full automation, failing to represent the collaborative\nnature of real-world use cases. In this paper, we make two major steps towards\nthe rigorous assessment of human-agent interactions. First, we propose PULSE, a\nframework for more efficient human-centric evaluation of agent designs, which\ncomprises collecting user feedback, training an ML model to predict user\nsatisfaction, and computing results by combining human satisfaction ratings\nwith model-generated pseudo-labels. Second, we deploy the framework on a\nlarge-scale web platform built around the open-source software agent OpenHands,\ncollecting in-the-wild usage data across over 15k users. We conduct case\nstudies around how three agent design decisions -- choice of LLM backbone,\nplanning strategy, and memory mechanisms -- impact developer satisfaction\nrates, yielding practical insights for software agent design. We also show how\nour framework can lead to more robust conclusions about agent design, reducing\nconfidence intervals by 40\\% compared to a standard A/B test. Finally, we find\nsubstantial discrepancies between in-the-wild results and benchmark performance\n(e.g., the anti-correlation between results comparing claude-sonnet-4 and\ngpt-5), underscoring the limitations of benchmark-driven evaluation. Our\nfindings provide guidance for evaluations of LLM agents with humans and\nidentify opportunities for better agent designs."}

This paper is submitted\n  to ICRA 2026", "summary": "We introduce a novel framework for automatic behavior tree (BT) construction\nin heterogeneous multi-robot systems, designed to address the challenges of\nadaptability and robustness in dynamic environments. Traditional robots are\nlimited by fixed functional attributes and cannot efficiently reconfigure their\nstrategies in response to task failures or environmental changes. To overcome\nthis limitation, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate and\nextend BTs dynamically, combining the reasoning and generalization power of\nLLMs with the modularity and recovery capability of BTs. The proposed framework\nconsists of four interconnected modules task initialization, task assignment,\nBT update, and failure node detection which operate in a closed loop. Robots\ntick their BTs during execution, and upon encountering a failure node, they can\neither extend the tree locally or invoke a centralized virtual coordinator\n(Alex) to reassign subtasks and synchronize BTs across peers. This design\nenables long-term cooperative execution in heterogeneous teams. We validate the\nframework on 60 tasks across three simulated scenarios and in a real-world cafe\nenvironment with a robotic arm and a wheeled-legged robot. Results show that\nour method consistently outperforms baseline approaches in task success rate,\nrobustness, and scalability, demonstrating its effectiveness for multi-robot\ncollaboration in complex scenarios."}

The research aim of this paper is to identify the short-run and\nlong-run macroeconomic determinants of job insecurity in the presence of\nasymmetric information between public and private agents, informative shocks,\nand different degrees of institutional communication transparency. To\naccomplish this goal, a small-scale, rational expectations, New Keynesian model\nis proposed in which limitedly informed households and firms receive a\npotentially noisy informative signal about the unobservables from fully\ninformed government and central bank. It is found that, notwithstanding the\nfulfillment of the Taylor principle, if public agents transfer all the\navailable information to the private agents without communication ambiguities,\nthe model admits a unique, stable equilibrium path along which the 'Paradox of\nTransparency' can emerge. Otherwise, the model's dynamics become unpredictable\nin terms of equilibrium existence and multiplicity, and job insecurity plays a\npotentially fundamental role in equilibrium determinacy.

Among them, the AlphaEarth\nFoundation (AE) represents a major step toward a global, unified representation\nof the Earth's surface, learning 10-meter embeddings from multi-source Earth\nObservation (EO) data that capture rich physical and environmental patterns\nacross diverse landscapes. However, such EO-driven representations remain\nlimited in capturing the functional and socioeconomic dimensions of cities, as\nthey primarily encode physical and spectral patterns rather than human\nactivities or spatial functions. We propose AETHER (AlphaEarth-POI Enriched\nRepresentation Learning), a lightweight framework that adapts AlphaEarth to\nhuman-centered urban analysis through multimodal alignment guided by Points of\nInterest (POIs). AETHER aligns AE embeddings with textual representations of\nPOIs, enriching physically grounded EO features with semantic cues about urban\nfunctions and socioeconomic contexts. In Greater London, AETHER achieves\nconsistent gains over the AE baseline, with a 7.2% relative improvement in\nland-use classification F1 and a 23.6% relative reduction in Kullback-Leibler\ndivergence for socioeconomic mapping. Built upon pretrained AE, AETHER\nleverages a lightweight multimodal alignment to enrich it with human-centered\nsemantics while remaining computationally efficient and scalable for urban\napplications.

A commonly used approach for this\ninference task in recent years is differentiable trajectory optimization, which\nallows gradients to be computed with respect to cost parameters by\ndifferentiating through an optimal control solver.

Our approach is motivated by the question: given a closed-loop\ncontrol law that solves an infinite-horizon optimal control problem, how does\nthis law change when the performance index is modified with additional terms?\nThis formulation yields closed-form characterizations for broad classes of\nsystems and performance indices, which not only facilitate interpretation and\nstability analysis, but also provide insight into the robust stability and\ninput-to-state stable behavior of the resulting nonlinear closed-loop system.\nMoreover, this analytical perspective enables the generalization of our\napproach to diverse design objectives, yielding a unifying framework for\nperformance index shaping.

A commonly used approach for this\ninference task in recent years is differentiable trajectory optimization, which\nallows gradients to be computed with respect to cost parameters by\ndifferentiating through an optimal control solver. However, this method often\nrequires repeated solving of the underlying optimal control problem at every\niteration, making the method computationally expensive. In this work, assuming\nknown dynamics, we propose a novel framework that analytically links the\nperformance index to the resulting closed-loop optimal control law, thereby\ntransforming a typically bi-level inverse problem into a tractable single-level\nformulation. Our approach is motivated by the question: given a closed-loop\ncontrol law that solves an infinite-horizon optimal control problem, how does\nthis law change when the performance index is modified with additional terms?\nThis formulation yields closed-form characterizations for broad classes of\nsystems and performance indices, which not only facilitate interpretation and\nstability analysis, but also provide insight into the robust stability and\ninput-to-state stable behavior of the resulting nonlinear closed-loop system.\nMoreover, this analytical perspective enables the generalization of our\napproach to diverse design objectives, yielding a unifying framework for\nperformance index shaping. Given specific design objectives, we propose a\nsystematic methodology to guide the shaping of the performance index and\nthereby design the resulting optimal control law."}

Rigorous evaluation requires a\nlarge number of real-world rollouts, while systematic improvement demands\nadditional corrective data with expert labels. Both of these processes are\nslow, costly, and difficult to scale. World models offer a promising, scalable\nalternative by enabling policies to rollout within imagination space. However,\na key challenge is building a controllable world model that can handle\nmulti-step interactions with generalist robot policies. This requires a world\nmodel compatible with modern generalist policies by supporting multi-view\nprediction, fine-grained action control, and consistent long-horizon\ninteractions, which is not achieved by previous works. In this paper, we make a\nstep forward by introducing a controllable multi-view world model that can be\nused to evaluate and improve the instruction-following ability of generalist\nrobot policies. Our model maintains long-horizon consistency with a\npose-conditioned memory retrieval mechanism and achieves precise action control\nthrough frame-level action conditioning. Trained on the DROID dataset (95k\ntrajectories, 564 scenes), our model generates spatially and temporally\nconsistent trajectories under novel scenarios and new camera placements for\nover 20 seconds. We show that our method can accurately rank policy performance\nwithout real-world robot rollouts. Moreover, by synthesizing successful\ntrajectories in imagination and using them for supervised fine-tuning, our\napproach can improve policy success by 44.7\\%."}

We propose a novel graph-theoretic framework that cleanly\nseparates credibility--external, a priori trust in sources--from confidence--an\ninternal, emergent valuation induced by network structure. Beliefs are nodes in\na directed, signed, weighted graph whose edges encode support and\ncontradiction. Confidence is obtained by a contractive propagation process that\nmixes a stated prior with structure-aware influence and guarantees a unique,\nstable solution. Within this dynamics, we define reasoning zones:\nhigh-confidence, structurally balanced subgraphs on which classical inference\nis safe despite global contradictions. We provide a near-linear procedure that\nseeds zones by confidence, tests balance using a parity-based coloring, and\napplies a greedy, locality-preserving repair with Jaccard de-duplication to\nbuild a compact atlas. To model belief change, we introduce shock updates that\nlocally downscale support and elevate targeted contradictions while preserving\ncontractivity via a simple backtracking rule. Re-propagation yields localized\nreconfiguration-zones may shrink, split, or collapse--without destabilizing the\nentire graph. We outline an empirical protocol on synthetic signed graphs with\nplanted zones, reporting zone recovery, stability under shocks, and runtime.\nThe result is a principled foundation for contradiction-tolerant reasoning that\nactivates classical logic precisely where structure supports it."}

Popular tutorials on\nblock-based programming with Scratch may unintentionally reinforce biases\nthrough character choices, narrative framing, or activity types. Educators\ncurrently lack support in identifying and addressing such bias. With large\nlanguage models~(LLMs) increasingly used to generate teaching materials, this\nproblem is potentially exacerbated by LLMs trained on biased datasets. However,\nLLMs also offer an opportunity to address this issue. In this paper, we explore\nthe use of LLMs for automatically identifying gender-stereotypical elements in\nScratch tutorials, thus offering feedback on how to improve teaching content.\nWe develop a framework for assessing gender bias considering characters,\ncontent, instructions, and programming concepts. Analogous to how code analysis\ntools provide feedback on code in terms of code smells, we operationalise this\nframework using an automated tool chain that identifies *gender stereotype\nsmells*. Evaluation on 73 popular Scratch tutorials from leading educational\nplatforms demonstrates that stereotype smells are common in practice.

Imitation learning methods typically rely\non successful examples and often neglect failure scenarios where uncertainty is\nmost pronounced. To address this limitation, we propose the Uncertainty-driven\nForesight Recurrent Neural Network (UF-RNN), a model that combines standard\ntime-series prediction with an active \"Foresight\" module. This module performs\ninternal simulations of multiple future trajectories and refines the hidden\nstate to minimize predicted variance, enabling the model to selectively explore\nactions under high uncertainty. We evaluate UF-RNN on a door-opening task in\nboth simulation and a real-robot setting, demonstrating that, despite the\nabsence of explicit failure demonstrations, the model exhibits robust\nadaptation by leveraging self-induced chaotic dynamics in its latent space.\nWhen guided by the Foresight module, these chaotic properties stimulate\nexploratory behaviors precisely when the environment is ambiguous, yielding\nimproved success rates compared to conventional stochastic RNN baselines.

Existing selective\nconformal prediction (SCP) methods provide statistical guarantees by\nconstructing prediction sets with a constrained miscoverage rate for correct\nanswers. However, prior works unrealistically assume that admissible answers\nfor all instances can be obtained via finite sampling, even for open-ended QA\nscenarios that lack a fixed and finite solution space. To address this, we\nintroduce a two-stage risk control framework comprising abstention-aware\nsampling and conformalized filtering (SAFER). Firstly, on a held-out\ncalibration set, SAFER calibrates a sampling budget within the maximum sampling\ncap, using the Clopper-Pearson exact method at a user-desired risk level (i.e.,\nthe maximum allowable miscoverage rate of the sampling sets). If the risk level\ncannot be satisfied within the cap, we abstain; otherwise, the calibrated\nsampling budget becomes the minimum requirements at test time. Then, we employ\ncalibration instances where correct answers are attainable under the calibrated\nbudget and apply the conformal risk control method to determine a statistically\nvalid uncertainty threshold, which filters unreliable distractors from the\ncandidate set for each test data point. In this stage, SAFER introduces an\nadditional risk level to guide the calculation of the threshold, thereby\ncontrolling the risk of correct answers being excluded. Furthermore, we show\nthat SAFER is compatible with various task-specific admission criteria and\ncalibration-test split ratios, highlighting its robustness and high data\nefficiency."}

Despite\nrecent advancements in VINS, resource constraints and numerical instability on\nembedded (robotic) systems with limited precision remain critical challenges. A\nsquare-root covariance-based filter offers a promising solution by providing\nnumerical stability, efficient memory usage, and guaranteed positive\nsemi-definiteness. However, canonical SRFs suffer from inefficiencies caused by\ndisruptions in the triangular structure of the covariance matrix during\nupdates. The proposed method significantly improves VINS efficiency with a\nnovel Cholesky decomposition (LLT)-based SRF update, by fully exploiting the\nsystem structure to preserve the structure. Moreover, we design a fast, robust,\ndynamic initialization method, which first recovers the minimal states without\ntriangulating 3D features and then efficiently performs iterative SRF update to\nrefine the full states, enabling seamless VINS operation. The proposed\nLLT-based SRF is extensively verified through numerical studies, demonstrating\nsuperior numerical stability and achieving robust efficient performance on\n32-bit single-precision floats, operating at twice the speed of\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

Video Summary: https://youtu.be/txYc9b1oflU", "summary": "Dynamic manipulation, such as robot tossing or throwing objects, has recently\ngained attention as a novel paradigm to speed up logistic operations. However,\nthe focus has predominantly been on the object's landing location, irrespective\nof its final orientation. In this work, we present a method enabling a robot to\naccurately \"throw-flip\" objects to a desired landing pose (position and\norientation). Conventionally, objects thrown by revolute robots suffer from\nparasitic rotation, resulting in highly restricted and uncontrollable landing\nposes. Our approach is based on two key design choices: first, leveraging the\nimpulse-momentum principle, we design a family of throwing motions that\neffectively decouple the parasitic rotation, significantly expanding the\nfeasible set of landing poses. Second, we combine a physics-based model of free\nflight with regression-based learning methods to account for unmodeled effects.\nReal robot experiments demonstrate that our framework can learn to throw-flip\nobjects to a pose target within ($\\pm$5 cm, $\\pm$45 degrees) threshold in\ndozens of trials. Thanks to data assimilation, incorporating projectile\ndynamics reduces sample complexity by an average of 40% when throw-flipping to\nunseen poses compared to end-to-end learning methods. Additionally, we show\nthat past knowledge on in-hand object spinning can be effectively reused,\naccelerating learning by 70% when throwing a new object with a Center of Mass\n(CoM) shift.

In this paper, we investigate this question by proposing a\nPerturbation-based Causal Identification of Critical Neurons method to\nsystematically locate such critical neurons in LLMs. Our findings reveal three\nkey insights: (1) LLMs contain ultra-sparse critical neuron sets. Disrupting\nthese critical neurons can cause a 72B-parameter model with over 1.1 billion\nneurons to completely collapse, with perplexity increasing by up to 20 orders\nof magnitude; (2) These critical neurons are not uniformly distributed, but\ntend to concentrate in the outer layers, particularly within the MLP down\\_proj\ncomponents; (3) Performance degradation exhibits sharp phase transitions,\nrather than a gradual decline, when these critical neurons are disrupted.\nThrough comprehensive experiments across diverse model architectures and\nscales, we provide deeper analysis of these phenomena and their implications\nfor LLM robustness and interpretability.

Both arrival\nstream are modeled using a modified Possion distribution that incorporate the\nseparation minima as well as the runway occupancy time. Various system level\nuncertainties are addressed in this process, including communication link- and\nhuman-related uncertainties. In this research, we first build a Monte\nCarlo-based discrete-time simulation, where aircraft arrivals are generated by\nmodified Poisson processes subject to minimum separation constraints,\nsimulating various traffic operations. The merging logic incorporates standard\nbank angle continuous turn-to-final, pilot response delays, and dynamic gap\navailability in real time.

By augmenting trajectories\nand incorporating the aforementioned uncertainties into the planning scenario,\nwe create a setup analogous to the discrete event simulation.

Traditional robots are\nlimited by fixed functional attributes and cannot efficiently reconfigure their\nstrategies in response to task failures or environmental changes. To overcome\nthis limitation, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate and\nextend BTs dynamically, combining the reasoning and generalization power of\nLLMs with the modularity and recovery capability of BTs. The proposed framework\nconsists of four interconnected modules task initialization, task assignment,\nBT update, and failure node detection which operate in a closed loop. Robots\ntick their BTs during execution, and upon encountering a failure node, they can\neither extend the tree locally or invoke a centralized virtual coordinator\n(Alex) to reassign subtasks and synchronize BTs across peers. This design\nenables long-term cooperative execution in heterogeneous teams.

Accepted to IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters\n  (RAL), 2025", "summary": "Achieving persistent tracking of multiple dynamic targets over a large\nspatial area poses significant challenges for a single-robot system with\nconstrained sensing capabilities. As the robot moves to track different\ntargets, the ones outside the field of view accumulate uncertainty, making them\nprogressively harder to track. An effective path planning algorithm must manage\nuncertainty over a long horizon and account for the risk of permanently losing\ntrack of targets that remain unseen for too long. However, most existing\napproaches rely on short planning horizons and assume small, bounded\nenvironments, resulting in poor tracking performance and target loss in\nlarge-scale scenarios. In this paper, we present a hierarchical planner for\ntracking multiple moving targets with an aerial vehicle. To address the\nchallenge of tracking non-static targets, our method incorporates motion models\nand uncertainty propagation during path execution, allowing for more informed\ndecision-making. We decompose the multi-target tracking task into sub-tasks of\nsingle target search and detection, and our proposed pipeline consists a novel\nlow-level coverage planner that enables searching for a target in an evolving\nbelief area, and an estimation method to assess the likelihood of success for\neach sub-task, making it possible to convert the active target tracking task to\na Markov decision process (MDP) that we solve with a tree-based algorithm to\ndetermine the sequence of sub-tasks. We validate our approach in simulation,\ndemonstrating its effectiveness compared to existing planners for active target\ntracking tasks, and our proposed planner outperforms existing approaches,\nachieving a reduction of 11-70% in final uncertainty across different\nenvironments."}

Adopting the layer-2 belief structure interpretation of RPS, we\nregard RPST as a refinement of TBM, where the order in the ordered focus set\nrepresents qualitative propensity. Starting from the permutation, we introduce\na new definition of the cumulative Jaccard index to quantify the similarity\nbetween two permutations and further propose a distance measure method for RPSs\nbased on the cumulative Jaccard index matrix. The metric and structural\nproperties of the proposed distance measure are investigated, including the\npositive definiteness analysis of the cumulative Jaccard index matrix, and a\ncorrection scheme is provided. The proposed method has a natural\ntop-weightiness property: inconsistencies between higher-ranked elements tend\nto result in greater distance values. Two parameters are provided to the\ndecision-maker to adjust the weight and truncation depth. Several numerical\nexamples are used to compare the proposed method with the existing method. The\nexperimental results show that the proposed method not only overcomes the\nshortcomings of the existing method and is compatible with the Jousselme\ndistance, but also has higher sensitivity and flexibility."}

We propose a novel graph-theoretic framework that cleanly\nseparates credibility--external, a priori trust in sources--from confidence--an\ninternal, emergent valuation induced by network structure. Beliefs are nodes in\na directed, signed, weighted graph whose edges encode support and\ncontradiction. Confidence is obtained by a contractive propagation process that\nmixes a stated prior with structure-aware influence and guarantees a unique,\nstable solution. Within this dynamics, we define reasoning zones:\nhigh-confidence, structurally balanced subgraphs on which classical inference\nis safe despite global contradictions. We provide a near-linear procedure that\nseeds zones by confidence, tests balance using a parity-based coloring, and\napplies a greedy, locality-preserving repair with Jaccard de-duplication to\nbuild a compact atlas. To model belief change, we introduce shock updates that\nlocally downscale support and elevate targeted contradictions while preserving\ncontractivity via a simple backtracking rule. Re-propagation yields localized\nreconfiguration-zones may shrink, split, or collapse--without destabilizing the\nentire graph. We outline an empirical protocol on synthetic signed graphs with\nplanted zones, reporting zone recovery, stability under shocks, and runtime.\nThe result is a principled foundation for contradiction-tolerant reasoning that\nactivates classical logic precisely where structure supports it."}

Existing work often deploys all robots\navailable without minimizing the fleet size, or neglects the constraints on\ntheir resources such as battery and memory. This work proposes an online\ncoordination scheme called LOMORO for collaborative target monitoring, path\nrouting and resource charging. It includes three core components: (I) the\nmodeling of multi-robot task assignment problem under the constraints on\nresources and monitoring intervals; (II) the resource-aware task coordination\nalgorithm iterates between the high-level assignment of dynamic targets and the\nlow-level multi-objective routing via the Martin's algorithm; (III) the online\nadaptation algorithm in case of unpredictable target behaviors and robot\nfailures.

Our approach couples masked\nvisual modeling with cross-modal contrastive alignment and employs three\nper-frame prompt tokens that explicitly encode the essential factors of a\ntalking-face frame - identity, vocal motion (speech-synchronized facial\ndynamics), and ambient motion (audio-agnostic movements such as blinks and head\npose). The contrastive objective uses time-aligned vocal-motion and audio\ntokens as positives and misaligned pairs as negatives, driving both modalities\ninto a shared embedding space and yielding token-level audio-visual stream\nsynchronization. After pretraining, the aligned audio tokens together with the\nvisual prompt tokens (identity, vocal motion, ambient motion) form a unified\ninterface for four disparate downstream settings: (i) audio-visual stream\nsynchronization; (ii) facial emotion and head/face action recognition; (iii)\nvisual speech recognition; and (iv) visual dubbing, for which we enable\nindistinguishable audio- or video-driven control within a single model.

To address this issue, we propose a novel hybrid\nframework that integrates large language model (LLM) with mathematical\noptimization in a dynamic hierarchical system: (1) it is training-free,\nremoving the need for large-scale interaction data as in RL, and (2) it\nleverages LLM to bridge cognitive limitations caused by problem decomposition\nby adaptively generating high-level objectives.

Thus, this work aims\nto address both issues by proposing Reward-Oriented Gains via Embodied\nRegulation (ROGER), which adapts reward-weighting gains online based on\npenalties received throughout the embodied interaction process. The ratio\nbetween the positive reward (primary reward) and negative reward (penalty)\ngains is automatically reduced as the learning approaches the constraint\nthresholds to avoid violation. Conversely, the ratio is increased when learning\nis in safe states to prioritize performance. With a 60-kg quadruped robot,\nROGER achieved near-zero constraint violation throughout multiple learning\ntrials. It also achieved up to 50% more primary reward than the equivalent\nstate-of-the-art techniques. In MuJoCo continuous locomotion benchmarks,\nincluding a single-leg hopper, ROGER exhibited comparable or up to 100% higher\nperformance and 60% less torque usage and orientation deviation compared to\nthose trained with the default reward function.

Many open-source\nautonomy systems rely on ROS 2 middleware; when multiple sensor and control\nnodes share one compute unit, ROS 2 and its DDS transports add significant\n(de)serialization, copying, and discovery overheads, shrinking the available\ntime budget. We present Sensor-in-Memory (SIM), a shared-memory transport\ndesigned for intra-host pipelines in autonomous vehicles. SIM keeps sensor data\nin native memory layouts (e.g., cv::Mat, PCL), uses lock-free bounded double\nbuffers that overwrite old data to prioritize freshness, and integrates into\nROS 2 nodes with four lines of code. Unlike traditional middleware, SIM\noperates beside ROS 2 and is optimized for applications where data freshness\nand minimal latency outweigh guaranteed completeness. SIM provides sequence\nnumbers, a writer heartbeat, and optional checksums to ensure ordering,\nliveness, and basic integrity. On an NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano, SIM reduces\ndata-transport latency by up to 98% compared to ROS 2 zero-copy transports such\nas FastRTPS and Zenoh, lowers mean latency by about 95%, and narrows\n95th/99th-percentile tail latencies by around 96%. In tests on a\nproduction-ready Level 4 vehicle running Autoware.Universe, SIM increased\nlocalization frequency from 7.5 Hz to 9.5 Hz.

Specifically, RoVer\n(i) assigns scalar-based process rewards to evaluate the reliability of\ncandidate actions, and (ii) predicts an action-space direction for candidate\nexpansion/refinement. During inference, RoVer generates multiple candidate\nactions concurrently from the base policy, expands them along PRM-predicted\ndirections, and then scores all candidates with PRM to select the optimal\naction for execution. Notably, by caching shared perception features, it can\namortize perception cost and evaluate more candidates under the same test-time\ncomputational budget. Essentially, our approach effectively transforms\navailable computing resources into better action decision-making, realizing the\nbenefits of test-time scaling without extra training overhead. Our\ncontributions are threefold: (1) a general, plug-and-play test-time scaling\nframework for VLAs; (2) a PRM that jointly provides scalar process rewards and\nan action-space direction to guide exploration; and (3) an efficient\ndirection-guided sampling strategy that leverages a shared perception cache to\nenable scalable candidate generation and selection during inference."}

Nowadays, robotic exoskeletons have shown great\npotentials in rehabilitation. Nevertheless, traditional rigid exoskeletons are\nusually heavy and need a lot of work to help the patients to put them on.\nMoreover, it also requires extra compliance control to guarantee the safety. In\ncontrast, soft exoskeletons are easy and comfortable to wear and have intrinsic\ncompliance, but their complex nonlinear human-robot interaction dynamics would\npose significant challenges for control. In this work, based on the pneumatic\nactuators inspired by origami, we design a rehabilitation exoskeleton for knee\nthat is easy and comfortable to wear. To guarantee the control performance and\nenable a nice human-robot interaction, we first use Deep Koopman Network to\nmodel the human-robot interaction dynamics. In particular, by viewing the\nelectromyography (EMG) signals and the duty cycle of the PWM wave that controls\nthe pneumatic robot's valves and pump as the inputs, the linear Koopman model\naccurately captures the complex human-robot interaction dynamics.

The goal of the rehabilitation training is to track a given\nreference signal shown on the screen.

Despite\nrecent advancements in VINS, resource constraints and numerical instability on\nembedded (robotic) systems with limited precision remain critical challenges. A\nsquare-root covariance-based filter offers a promising solution by providing\nnumerical stability, efficient memory usage, and guaranteed positive\nsemi-definiteness. However, canonical SRFs suffer from inefficiencies caused by\ndisruptions in the triangular structure of the covariance matrix during\nupdates. The proposed method significantly improves VINS efficiency with a\nnovel Cholesky decomposition (LLT)-based SRF update, by fully exploiting the\nsystem structure to preserve the structure. Moreover, we design a fast, robust,\ndynamic initialization method, which first recovers the minimal states without\ntriangulating 3D features and then efficiently performs iterative SRF update to\nrefine the full states, enabling seamless VINS operation. The proposed\nLLT-based SRF is extensively verified through numerical studies, demonstrating\nsuperior numerical stability and achieving robust efficient performance on\n32-bit single-precision floats, operating at twice the speed of\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

However,\nthe focus has predominantly been on the object's landing location, irrespective\nof its final orientation. In this work, we present a method enabling a robot to\naccurately \"throw-flip\" objects to a desired landing pose (position and\norientation). Conventionally, objects thrown by revolute robots suffer from\nparasitic rotation, resulting in highly restricted and uncontrollable landing\nposes. Our approach is based on two key design choices: first, leveraging the\nimpulse-momentum principle, we design a family of throwing motions that\neffectively decouple the parasitic rotation, significantly expanding the\nfeasible set of landing poses. Second, we combine a physics-based model of free\nflight with regression-based learning methods to account for unmodeled effects.\nReal robot experiments demonstrate that our framework can learn to throw-flip\nobjects to a pose target within ($\\pm$5 cm, $\\pm$45 degrees) threshold in\ndozens of trials. Thanks to data assimilation, incorporating projectile\ndynamics reduces sample complexity by an average of 40% when throw-flipping to\nunseen poses compared to end-to-end learning methods. Additionally, we show\nthat past knowledge on in-hand object spinning can be effectively reused,\naccelerating learning by 70% when throwing a new object with a Center of Mass\n(CoM) shift.

AI Chatbots present an\nopportunity to address these challenges. However, AI systems also have the\npotential to generate biased responses, prejudices related to race, gender,\nsocioeconomic status, and disability. These biases risk turning away potential\nstudents and undermining reliability of AI systems. This study aims to develop\na University of Maryland (UMD) A. James Clark School of Engineering\nProgram-specific AI chatbot. Our research team analyzed and mitigated potential\nbiases in the responses. Through testing the chatbot on diverse student\nqueries, the responses are scored on metrics of accuracy, relevance,\npersonalization, and bias presence. The results demonstrate that with careful\nprompt engineering and bias mitigation strategies, AI chatbots can provide\nhigh-quality, unbiased academic advising support, achieving mean scores of 9.76\nfor accuracy, 9.56 for relevance, and 9.60 for personalization with no\nstereotypical biases found in the sample data.

Accepted to IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters\n  (RAL), 2025", "summary": "Achieving persistent tracking of multiple dynamic targets over a large\nspatial area poses significant challenges for a single-robot system with\nconstrained sensing capabilities. As the robot moves to track different\ntargets, the ones outside the field of view accumulate uncertainty, making them\nprogressively harder to track. An effective path planning algorithm must manage\nuncertainty over a long horizon and account for the risk of permanently losing\ntrack of targets that remain unseen for too long. However, most existing\napproaches rely on short planning horizons and assume small, bounded\nenvironments, resulting in poor tracking performance and target loss in\nlarge-scale scenarios. In this paper, we present a hierarchical planner for\ntracking multiple moving targets with an aerial vehicle. To address the\nchallenge of tracking non-static targets, our method incorporates motion models\nand uncertainty propagation during path execution, allowing for more informed\ndecision-making. We decompose the multi-target tracking task into sub-tasks of\nsingle target search and detection, and our proposed pipeline consists a novel\nlow-level coverage planner that enables searching for a target in an evolving\nbelief area, and an estimation method to assess the likelihood of success for\neach sub-task, making it possible to convert the active target tracking task to\na Markov decision process (MDP) that we solve with a tree-based algorithm to\ndetermine the sequence of sub-tasks. We validate our approach in simulation,\ndemonstrating its effectiveness compared to existing planners for active target\ntracking tasks, and our proposed planner outperforms existing approaches,\nachieving a reduction of 11-70% in final uncertainty across different\nenvironments."}

When the safety margin deteriorates, it triggers\nswitching the safety constraint from a performance-based relaxed-control\nbarrier function (R-CBF) to a conservative conditional value at risk (CVaR-CBF)\nto address the safety concern. This switching is governed by two real-time\ntriggers: Feasibility-Triggered (FT) and Quality-Triggered (QT) conditions. In\nthe FT condition, if the R-CBF constraint becomes infeasible or yields a\nsuboptimal solution, the risk monitor triggers the use of the CVaR constraints\nfor the controller. In the QT condition, the risk monitor observes the safety\nmargin of the R-CBF solution at every step, regardless of feasibility. If it\nfalls below the safety margin, the safety filter switches to the CVaR-CBF\nconstraints.\n  The proposed framework is evaluated using a model predictive controller (MPC)\nfor autonomous driving in the presence of autonomous vehicle (AV) localization\nnoise and obstacle position uncertainties.

Although rigid-body symmetry is one of the most established\nand fundamental tools in robotics, there appears to be no comparable treatment\nof Galilean symmetry for a robotics audience. In this paper, we present a\nrobotics-tailored exposition of Galilean symmetry that leverages the\ncommunity's familiarity with and understanding of rigid-body transformations\nand pose representations. Our approach contrasts with common treatments in the\nphysics literature that introduce Galilean symmetry as a stepping stone to\nEinstein's relativity. A key insight is that the Galilean matrix Lie group can\nbe used to describe two different pose representations, Galilean frames, that\nuse inertial velocity in the state definition, and extended poses, that use\ncoordinate velocity. We provide three examples where applying the Galilean\nmatrix Lie-group algebra to robotics problems is straightforward and yields\nsignificant insights: inertial navigation above the rotating Earth, manipulator\nkinematics, and sensor data fusion under temporal uncertainty. We believe that\nthe time is right for the robotics community to benefit from rediscovering and\nextending this classical material and applying it to modern problems."}

However, their behavior is often governed by a cost\nfunction with manually tuned, static weights, which forces a tactical\ncompromise that is suboptimal across the wide range of scenarios encountered in\na race. To address this shortcoming, we propose using a Reinforcement Learning\n(RL) agent as a high-level behavioral selector that dynamically switches the\ncost function parameters of an analytical, low-level trajectory planner during\nruntime. We show the effectiveness of our approach in simulation in an\nautonomous racing environment where our RL-based planner achieved 0% collision\nrate while reducing overtaking time by up to 60% compared to state-of-the-art\nstatic planners. Our new agent now dynamically switches between aggressive and\nconservative behaviors, enabling interactive maneuvers unattainable with static\nconfigurations. These results demonstrate that integrating reinforcement\nlearning as a high-level selector resolves the inherent trade-off between\nsafety and competitiveness in autonomous racing planners. The proposed\nmethodology offers a pathway toward adaptive yet interpretable motion planning\nfor broader autonomous driving applications."}

However, every alignment technique has failure modes, which are\nconditions in which there is a non-negligible chance that the technique fails\nto provide safety. As a strategy for risk mitigation, the AI safety community\nhas increasingly adopted a defense-in-depth framework: Conceding that there is\nno single technique which guarantees safety, defense-in-depth consists in\nhaving multiple redundant protections against safety failure, such that safety\ncan be maintained even if some protections fail. However, the success of\ndefense-in-depth depends on how (un)correlated failure modes are across\nalignment techniques. For example, if all techniques had the exact same failure\nmodes, the defense-in-depth approach would provide no additional protection at\nall. In this paper, we analyze 7 representative alignment techniques and 7\nfailure modes to understand the extent to which they overlap.

We introduce Procedure Aware DynaMic Execution (PADME), an agent\nframework that produces and exploits a graph-based representation of\nprocedures. Unlike prior work that relies on manual graph construction or\nunstructured reasoning, PADME autonomously transforms procedural text into\nexecutable graphs that capture task dependencies, decision points, and reusable\nsubroutines. Central to PADME is a two-phase methodology; Teach phase, which\nfocuses on systematic structuring, enrichment with executable logic of\nprocedures, followed by Execute phase, which enables dynamic execution in\nresponse to real-time inputs and environment feedback. This separation ensures\nquality assurance and scalability, allowing expert knowledge to be encoded once\nand reliably reused across varying contexts. The graph representation also\nprovides an inductive bias that reduces error accumulation in long-horizon\nreasoning, underscoring the importance of structured procedure modeling for\nreliable agent-driven automation.

The geometric heat flow equation involves solving a parabolic partial\ndifferential equation whose solution is a geodesic.

We prove that the geometric heat flow equation is globally\nexponentially stable in $L_2$ if the curvature of the Riemannian manifold is\nnot too positive, and that asymptotic convergence in $L_2$ is always\nguaranteed.
