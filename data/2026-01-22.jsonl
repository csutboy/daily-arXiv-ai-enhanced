For sponsors, the central message is not merely that ``Bayes is allowed,'' but that Bayesian designs should be justified through explicit success criteria, thoughtful priors (especially when borrowing external information), prospective operating-characteristic evaluation (often via simulation when simulation is used), and computational transparency suitable for regulatory review. This paper provides a practical, regulatory-oriented synthesis of the draft guidance, highlighting where Bayesian designs can be calibrated to traditional frequentist error-rate targets and where, with sponsor--FDA agreement, alternative Bayesian operating metrics may be appropriate. We illustrate expectations through examples discussed in the guidance (e.g., platform trials, external/nonconcurrent controls, pediatric extrapolation) and conclude with an actionable checklist for planning documents and submission packages."}

Program chairs must balance competing objectives, including maximizing reviewer expertise, promoting diversity, and enhancing robustness to strategic manipulation, but it is challenging to do so at the modern conference scale.\n  Existing algorithmic paper assignment approaches either fail to address all of these goals simultaneously or suffer from poor scalability. To address the limitation, we propose Robust Assignment via Marginal Perturbation (RAMP), a unified framework for large-scale peer review. Our approach formulates a linearized perturbed-maximization objective with soft constraints that flexibly balance assignment quality, diversity, and robustness while maintaining runtime efficiency. We further introduce an attribute-aware sampling procedure that converts fractional solutions into integral assignments and improves the diversity and robustness of the final assignment. On datasets with over 20,000 papers and 20,000 reviewers, RAMP runs in under 20 minutes, demonstrating its suitability for real-world deployment."}

However, classical SDMs ignore inter-species dependencies. Multivariate SDMs (MSDMs), especially those based on latent Gaussian fields such as the multivariate Poisson log-normal (MPLN), address this limitation but face challenges related to computation, dimensionality, and interpretability. Pólya-splitting (PS) distributions offer an alternative, combining a model for total abundance with a multivariate allocation structure, and have natural interpretations from ecological process models. Yet, they lack flexibility in modeling correlation structures. Tree Pólya-splitting (TPS) distributions overcome this by introducing hierarchical structure such as a phylogenetic tree. In this paper, we extend TPS to account for zero-inflation, leading to the zero-inflated tree Pólya-splitting (Z-TPS) family. We detail its statistical properties, show how standard software enables efficient inference, and illustrate its ecological relevance using tree abundance data from over 180 genera across the Congo Basin tropical rainforest."}

The edge-based $γ$-quasi-clique model offers a flexible alternative by identifying subgraphs whose edge densities exceed a specified threshold $γ$. However, finding the exact maximum edge-based quasi-clique is computationally challenging, as the problem is NP-hard and lacks the hereditary property. These characteristics limit the effectiveness of conventional pruning methods and the development of efficient reduction rules. As a result, existing algorithms, such as QClique and FPCE, struggle to scale to large graphs. In this paper, we revisit the problem and propose a novel iterative framework that reformulates the problem as a sequence of hereditary subproblems, enabling more effective pruning and reduction strategies and improving the worst-case time complexity. Furthermore, we redesign the iterative process and introduce a novel heuristic to further improve practical efficiency. Extensive experiments on 253 large-scale real-world graphs demonstrate that our proposed algorithm EQC-Pro outperforms existing methods by up to four orders of magnitude."}

The testable implications aggregate (via integration) an otherwise potentially infinite set of inequalities that must hold for every measurable subset of the outcome's support. For binary instruments the testable implications are sharp. Furthermore, I propose an implementation that links restrictions on latent response types to a generalization of first-order stochastic dominance and random utility models, allowing to distinguish violations of the exclusion restriction from violations of monotonicity-type assumptions. The testable implications extend naturally to the many instruments case."}

Using EC purchase data (N = 55,645 users) and independent insurance-derived clinical records, we compare ingredient-level risk patterns and seasonal disease dynamics in feline lower urinary tract disease (FLUTD) as a case study.\n  The proxy-based estimates show strong agreement with clinical data, with correlations of r = 0.74 for ingredient-level risk patterns and r = 0.82 for seasonal variation. Both data sources consistently capture elevated disease risk during winter months. Moreover, analysis using EC data alone reproduces established domain knowledge, including the association between higher wet food consumption and lower disease risk.\n  Our results demonstrate that behavioral signals derived from large-scale EC data can serve as validated, cost-effective complements to traditional surveillance systems, and suggest broader applicability to monitoring lifestyle-related and chronic conditions."}

Stochastic computation has been recently exploited for area-efficient hardware implementation, such as low-density parity-check (LDPC) decoders and image processors. However, power-and-area hungry two-step (analog-to-digital and digital-to-stochastic) converters are required for the analog to stochastic signal conversion. To realize a one-step conversion, an MTJ device is used as it inherently exhibits a probabilistic switching behavior between two resistance states. Exploiting the device-based probabilistic behavior, analog signals can be directly and area-efficiently converted to stochastic signals to mitigate the signal-conversion overhead. The analog-to-stochastic signal conversion is theoretically described and the conversion characteristic is evaluated using device and circuit parameters. In addition, the resistance variability of the MTJ device is considered in order to compensate the variability effect on the signal conversion. Based on the theoretical analysis, the analog-to-stochastic converter is designed in 90nm CMOS and 100nm MTJ technologies and is verified using a SPICE simulator (NS-SPICE) that handles both transistors and MTJ devices."}

When models detect systematic testing, these effects collapse, revealing that systems treat source-sensitivity as bias to suppress rather than as a capacity to execute well. I distinguish two constitutional approaches: the Platonic, which mandates formal correctness and default source-independence from a privileged standpoint, and the Liberal, which refuses such privilege, specifying procedural norms that protect conditions for collective inquiry while allowing principled source-attending grounded in epistemic vigilance. I argue for the Liberal approach, sketch a constitutional core of eight principles and four orientations, and propose that AI epistemic governance requires the same explicit, contestable structure we now expect for AI ethics."}

We show that subdiffusive transport on graphs is a memory-driven process generated by a random time change that compresses operational time, produces long-tailed waiting times, and breaks Markovianity while preserving linearity and mass conservation. We prove that Mittag-Leffler graph dynamics admit an exact convex, mass-preserving representation as a superposition of classical heat semigroups evaluated at rescaled times, revealing fractional diffusion as ordinary diffusion acting across multiple intrinsic time scales. This framework uncovers heterogeneous, vertex-dependent memory effects and induces transport biases absent in classical diffusion, including algebraic relaxation, degree-dependent waiting times, and early-time asymmetries between sources and neighbors. These features define a subdiffusive geometry on graphs enabling particles to locally discover global shortest paths while favoring high-degree regions. Finally, we show that time-fractional diffusion arises as a singular limit of multi-rate diffusion."}

First, we introduce VisTIRA (Vision and Tool-Integrated Reasoning Agent), a tool-integrated reasoning framework that enables structured problem solving by iteratively decomposing a given math problem (as an image) into natural language rationales and executable Python steps to determine the final answer. Second, we build a framework to measure and improve visual math reasoning: a LaTeX-based pipeline that converts chain-of-thought math corpora (e.g., NuminaMath) into challenging image counterparts, and a large set of synthetic tool-use trajectories derived from a real-world, homework-style image dataset (called SnapAsk) for fine-tuning VLMs. Our experiments show that tool-integrated supervision improves image-based reasoning, and OCR grounding can further narrow the gap for smaller models, although its benefit diminishes at scale.

The canonical formula becomes coherence data: a natural transformation $η:U\\Rightarrow V$ between update endofunctors, where $U$ updates each register in place and $V$ performs a swap+inversion. Context is internalized by operator choice, turning naturality into a corpus-facing type check: failures diagnose mis-specified oppositions or illegal transport; successes witness coherent structural models. Order effects are summarized by a five-value invariant (Key). We apply the method to 80 narratives (20 folktales, 20 religious myths, 20 superheroes, 20 franchises), each encoded as $(a,b,x,y)$ with a Key. 59/80 (74\\%) explicitly name a normative constraint in $y$ (law, taboo, contract, prophecy), supporting the two-register abstraction.

Genetic programming has been widely applied as a hyper-heuristic to evolve priority rules that guide the selection of activity-mode pairs from the current eligible set. Recently, an activity group selection strategy has been proposed to select a subset of activities rather than a single activity at each decision point, allowing for more effective scheduling by considering the interdependence between activities. Although effective in small-scale instances, this strategy suffers from scalability issues when applied to larger problems. In this work, we enhance the scalability of the group selection strategy by introducing a knee-point-based selection mechanism to identify a promising subset of activities before evaluating their combinations. An activity ordering rule is first used to rank all eligible activity-mode pairs, followed by a knee point selection to find the promising pairs. Then, a group selection rule selects the best activity combination. We develop a multi-tree GP framework to evolve both types of rules simultaneously. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach scales well to large instances and outperforms GP with sequential decision-making in most scenarios."}

This paper asks: how do LLMs perceive the intellectual capabilities of student profiles from intersecting marginalized identities across different cultural contexts? We conduct one of the first large-scale intersectional analyses on LLM explanation quality for Indian and American undergraduate profiles preparing for engineering entrance examinations. By constructing profiles combining multiple demographic dimensions including caste, medium of instruction, and school boards in India, and race, HBCU attendance, and school type in America, alongside universal factors like income and college tier, we examine how quality varies across these factors. We observe biases providing lower-quality outputs to profiles with marginalized backgrounds in both contexts. LLMs such as Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct and GPT-4o demonstrate granular understandings of context-specific discrimination, systematically providing simpler explanations to Hindi/Regional-medium students in India and HBCU profiles in America, treating these as proxies for lower capability. Even when marginalized profiles attain social mobility by getting accepted into elite institutions, they still receive more simplistic explanations, showing how demographic information is inextricably linked to LLM biases. Different models (Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct, GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, GPT-OSS 20B) embed similar biases against historically marginalized populations in both contexts, preventing profiles from switching between AI assistants for better results. Our findings have strong implications for AI incorporation into global engineering education."}

Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference (FIMI) and related hybrid activities are conducted across various societal dimensions and infospheres, posing an ever greater challenge to the characterization of threats, sustaining situational awareness, and response coordination. Recent advances in AI have further led to the decreasing cost of AI-augmented trolling and interference activities, such as through the generation and amplification of manipulative content. Despite the introduction of the DISARM framework as a standardized metadata and analytical framework for FIMI, operationalizing it at the scale of social media remains a challenge. We propose a framework-agnostic agent-based operationalization of DISARM to investigate FIMI on social media.

When models detect systematic testing, these effects collapse, revealing that systems treat source-sensitivity as bias to suppress rather than as a capacity to execute well. I distinguish two constitutional approaches: the Platonic, which mandates formal correctness and default source-independence from a privileged standpoint, and the Liberal, which refuses such privilege, specifying procedural norms that protect conditions for collective inquiry while allowing principled source-attending grounded in epistemic vigilance.

A theory with growing evidence is that people simulate using simplified representations of the environment that abstract away from irrelevant details, but it is unclear how people determine these simplifications efficiently. Here, we present a \"Just-in-Time\" framework for simulation-based reasoning that demonstrates how such representations can be constructed online with minimal added computation. The model uses a tight interleaving of simulation, visual search, and representation modification, with the current simulation guiding where to look and visual search flagging objects that should be encoded for subsequent simulation. Despite only ever encoding a small subset of objects, the model makes high-utility predictions. We find strong empirical support for this account over alternative models in a grid-world planning task and a physical reasoning task across a range of behavioral measures. Together, these results offer a concrete algorithmic account of how people construct reduced representations to support efficient mental simulation."}

Recent work has explored large language model (LLM)-assisted evolutionary methods for automated code optimization, but these approaches primarily rely on outcome-based selection and random mutation, underutilizing the rich trajectory information generated during iterative optimization. We propose PhyloEvolve, an LLM-agent system that reframes GPU-oriented algorithm optimization as an In-Context Reinforcement Learning (ICRL) problem. This formulation enables trajectory-conditioned reuse of optimization experience without model retraining. PhyloEvolve integrates Algorithm Distillation and prompt-based Decision Transformers into an iterative workflow, treating sequences of algorithm modifications and performance feedback as first-class learning signals. To organize optimization history, we introduce a phylogenetic tree representation that captures inheritance, divergence, and recombination among algorithm variants, enabling backtracking, cross-lineage transfer, and reproducibility. The system combines elite trajectory pooling, multi-island parallel exploration, and containerized execution to balance exploration and exploitation across heterogeneous hardware. We evaluate PhyloEvolve on scientific computing workloads including PDE solvers, manifold learning, and spectral graph algorithms, demonstrating consistent improvements in runtime, memory efficiency, and correctness over baseline and evolutionary methods.

We evaluate this claim using controlled simulations that compare legacy keyword-based screening with semantic matching based on high-dimensional vector representations of resumes and job descriptions.\n  The results demonstrate substantial improvements in recall and overall matching efficiency without a corresponding loss in precision. Building on these findings, the paper proposes a candidate-side workforce operating architecture that standardizes, verifies, and semantically aligns human capital signals while remaining interoperable with existing recruitment infrastructure.

Such shortcomings stem from two key factors: (1) methodological complexity - agent orchestration is performed using sequential, code-level execution that limits global system-level holistic reasoning and scales poorly with agent complexity - and (2) efficacy uncertainty - MAS are deployed without understanding if there are tangible benefits compared to single-agent systems (SAS). We propose MAS-Orchestra, a training-time framework that formulates MAS orchestration as a function-calling reinforcement learning problem with holistic orchestration, generating an entire MAS at once. In MAS-Orchestra, complex, goal-oriented sub-agents are abstracted as callable functions, enabling global reasoning over system structure while hiding internal execution details. To rigorously study when and why MAS are beneficial, we introduce MASBENCH, a controlled benchmark that characterizes tasks along five axes: Depth, Horizon, Breadth, Parallel, and Robustness. Our analysis reveals that MAS gains depend critically on task structure, verification protocols, and the capabilities of both orchestrator and sub-agents, rather than holding universally. Guided by these insights, MAS-Orchestra achieves consistent improvements on public benchmarks including mathematical reasoning, multi-hop QA, and search-based QA. Together, MAS-Orchestra and MASBENCH enable better training and understanding of MAS in the pursuit of multi-agent intelligence."}

Students begin with an existing code base, a practice that is crucial for mirroring real-world software development. Students then iteratively complete tasks that pass predefined tests. The instructor only manages a hidden parent repository containing solutions, which is used to generate an intermediate public repository with these solutions removed via a templating system.

First, we introduce VisTIRA (Vision and Tool-Integrated Reasoning Agent), a tool-integrated reasoning framework that enables structured problem solving by iteratively decomposing a given math problem (as an image) into natural language rationales and executable Python steps to determine the final answer. Second, we build a framework to measure and improve visual math reasoning: a LaTeX-based pipeline that converts chain-of-thought math corpora (e.g., NuminaMath) into challenging image counterparts, and a large set of synthetic tool-use trajectories derived from a real-world, homework-style image dataset (called SnapAsk) for fine-tuning VLMs. Our experiments show that tool-integrated supervision improves image-based reasoning, and OCR grounding can further narrow the gap for smaller models, although its benefit diminishes at scale. These findings highlight that modality gap severity inversely correlates with model size, and that structured reasoning and OCR-based grounding are complementary strategies for advancing visual mathematical reasoning."}

Existing automated tools tend to rely on pattern matching or fixed rules, which fail to capture context and may alter the meaning of the data. This study uses local LLMs to build a reliable, repeatable, and context-aware anonymization process for detecting and anonymizing sensitive data in qualitative transcripts. We introduce a Structured Framework for Adaptive Anonymizer (SFAA) that includes three steps: detection, classification, and adaptive anonymization. The SFAA incorporates four anonymization strategies: rule-based substitution, context-aware rewriting, generalization, and suppression. These strategies are applied based on the identifier type and the risk level. The identifiers handled by the SFAA are guided by major international privacy and research ethics standards, including the GDPR, HIPAA, and OECD guidelines. This study followed a dual-method evaluation that combined manual and LLM-assisted processing. Two case studies were used to support the evaluation. The first includes 82 face-to-face interviews on gamification in organizations. The second involves 93 machine-led interviews using an AI-powered interviewer to test LLM awareness and workplace privacy. Two local models, LLaMA and Phi were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework. The results indicate that the LLMs found more sensitive data than a human reviewer. Phi outperformed LLaMA in finding sensitive data, but made slightly more errors. Phi was able to find over 91% of the sensitive data and 94.8% kept the same sentiment as the original text, which means it was very accurate, hence, it does not affect the analysis of the qualitative data."}

While LLMs show strong potential in handling legal knowledge and tasks, their deployment in real-world legal settings raises critical concerns beyond surface-level accuracy, involving the soundness of legal reasoning processes and trustworthy issues such as fairness and reliability. Systematic evaluation of LLM performance in legal tasks has therefore become essential for their responsible adoption. This survey identifies key challenges in evaluating LLMs for legal tasks grounded in real-world legal practice. We analyze the major difficulties involved in assessing LLM performance in the legal domain, including outcome correctness, reasoning reliability, and trustworthiness. Building on these challenges, we review and categorize existing evaluation methods and benchmarks according to their task design, datasets, and evaluation metrics. We further discuss the extent to which current approaches address these challenges, highlight their limitations, and outline future research directions toward more realistic, reliable, and legally grounded evaluation frameworks for LLMs in legal domains."}

Genetic programming has been widely applied as a hyper-heuristic to evolve priority rules that guide the selection of activity-mode pairs from the current eligible set. Recently, an activity group selection strategy has been proposed to select a subset of activities rather than a single activity at each decision point, allowing for more effective scheduling by considering the interdependence between activities. Although effective in small-scale instances, this strategy suffers from scalability issues when applied to larger problems. In this work, we enhance the scalability of the group selection strategy by introducing a knee-point-based selection mechanism to identify a promising subset of activities before evaluating their combinations. An activity ordering rule is first used to rank all eligible activity-mode pairs, followed by a knee point selection to find the promising pairs. Then, a group selection rule selects the best activity combination. We develop a multi-tree GP framework to evolve both types of rules simultaneously. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach scales well to large instances and outperforms GP with sequential decision-making in most scenarios."}

Although large language models (LLMs) offer rich semantic understanding for free-form recommendation, applying them to long-horizon LPR is challenging due to (i) misalignment with pedagogical objectives such as the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) under sparse, delayed feedback, (ii) scarce and costly expert demonstrations, and (iii) multi-objective interactions among learning effect, difficulty scheduling, length controllability, and trajectory diversity. To address these issues, we propose IB-GRPO (Indicator-Based Group Relative Policy Optimization), an indicator-guided alignment approach for LLM-based LPR. To mitigate data scarcity, we construct hybrid expert demonstrations via Genetic Algorithm search and teacher RL agents and warm-start the LLM with supervised fine-tuning. Building on this warm-start, we design a within-session ZPD alignment score for difficulty scheduling. IB-GRPO then uses the $I_{ε+}$ dominance indicator to compute group-relative advantages over multiple objectives, avoiding manual scalarization and improving Pareto trade-offs. Experiments on ASSIST09 and Junyi using the KES simulator with a Qwen2.5-7B backbone show consistent improvements over representative RL and LLM baselines."}

This paper argues for an epistemic constitution for AI: explicit, contestable meta-norms that regulate how systems form and express beliefs. Source attribution bias provides the motivating case: I show that frontier models enforce identity-stance coherence, penalizing arguments attributed to sources whose expected ideological position conflicts with the argument's content. When models detect systematic testing, these effects collapse, revealing that systems treat source-sensitivity as bias to suppress rather than as a capacity to execute well. I distinguish two constitutional approaches: the Platonic, which mandates formal correctness and default source-independence from a privileged standpoint, and the Liberal, which refuses such privilege, specifying procedural norms that protect conditions for collective inquiry while allowing principled source-attending grounded in epistemic vigilance. I argue for the Liberal approach, sketch a constitutional core of eight principles and four orientations, and propose that AI epistemic governance requires the same explicit, contestable structure we now expect for AI ethics."}

This paper asks: how do LLMs perceive the intellectual capabilities of student profiles from intersecting marginalized identities across different cultural contexts? We conduct one of the first large-scale intersectional analyses on LLM explanation quality for Indian and American undergraduate profiles preparing for engineering entrance examinations. By constructing profiles combining multiple demographic dimensions including caste, medium of instruction, and school boards in India, and race, HBCU attendance, and school type in America, alongside universal factors like income and college tier, we examine how quality varies across these factors. We observe biases providing lower-quality outputs to profiles with marginalized backgrounds in both contexts. LLMs such as Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct and GPT-4o demonstrate granular understandings of context-specific discrimination, systematically providing simpler explanations to Hindi/Regional-medium students in India and HBCU profiles in America, treating these as proxies for lower capability. Even when marginalized profiles attain social mobility by getting accepted into elite institutions, they still receive more simplistic explanations, showing how demographic information is inextricably linked to LLM biases. Different models (Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct, GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, GPT-OSS 20B) embed similar biases against historically marginalized populations in both contexts, preventing profiles from switching between AI assistants for better results. Our findings have strong implications for AI incorporation into global engineering education."}

This paradigm implicitly assumes that the agent's CoT faithfully reflects both its internal reasoning and the underlying environment state. We show this assumption is brittle: LLM judges are highly susceptible to manipulation of agent reasoning traces. By systematically rewriting agent CoTs while holding actions and observations fixed, we demonstrate that manipulated reasoning alone can inflate false positive rates of state-of-the-art VLM judges by up to 90% across 800 trajectories spanning diverse web tasks. We study manipulation strategies spanning style-based approaches that alter only the presentation of reasoning and content-based approaches that fabricate signals of task progress, and find that content-based manipulations are consistently more effective. We evaluate prompting-based techniques and scaling judge-time compute, which reduce but do not fully eliminate susceptibility to manipulation. Our findings reveal a fundamental vulnerability in LLM-based evaluation and highlight the need for judging mechanisms that verify reasoning claims against observable evidence."}

Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference (FIMI) and related hybrid activities are conducted across various societal dimensions and infospheres, posing an ever greater challenge to the characterization of threats, sustaining situational awareness, and response coordination. Recent advances in AI have further led to the decreasing cost of AI-augmented trolling and interference activities, such as through the generation and amplification of manipulative content. Despite the introduction of the DISARM framework as a standardized metadata and analytical framework for FIMI, operationalizing it at the scale of social media remains a challenge. We propose a framework-agnostic agent-based operationalization of DISARM to investigate FIMI on social media. We develop a multi-agent pipeline in which specialized agentic AI components collaboratively (1) detect candidate manipulative behaviors, and (2) map these behaviors onto standard DISARM taxonomies in a transparent manner. We evaluated the approach on two real-world datasets annotated by domain practitioners. We demonstrate that our approach is effective in scaling the predominantly manual and heavily interpretive work of FIMI analysis, providing a direct contribution to enhancing the situational awareness and data interoperability in the context of operating in media and information-rich settings."}

Recent vision-language models (VLMs) demonstrate reasoning and generalization abilities, opening new possibilities for autonomous driving; however, existing benchmarks and metrics overemphasize perceptual competence and fail to adequately assess decision-making processes. In this work, we present AutoDriDM, a decision-centric, progressive benchmark with 6,650 questions across three dimensions - Object, Scene, and Decision. We evaluate mainstream VLMs to delineate the perception-to-decision capability boundary in autonomous driving, and our correlation analysis reveals weak alignment between perception and decision-making performance. We further conduct explainability analyses of models' reasoning processes, identifying key failure modes such as logical reasoning errors, and introduce an analyzer model to automate large-scale annotation. AutoDriDM bridges the gap between perception-centered and decision-centered evaluation, providing guidance toward safer and more reliable VLMs for real-world autonomous driving."}

A theory with growing evidence is that people simulate using simplified representations of the environment that abstract away from irrelevant details, but it is unclear how people determine these simplifications efficiently. Here, we present a \"Just-in-Time\" framework for simulation-based reasoning that demonstrates how such representations can be constructed online with minimal added computation. The model uses a tight interleaving of simulation, visual search, and representation modification, with the current simulation guiding where to look and visual search flagging objects that should be encoded for subsequent simulation. Despite only ever encoding a small subset of objects, the model makes high-utility predictions. We find strong empirical support for this account over alternative models in a grid-world planning task and a physical reasoning task across a range of behavioral measures. Together, these results offer a concrete algorithmic account of how people construct reduced representations to support efficient mental simulation."}

Advertisers often have personalized objectives but limited historical interaction data, resulting in few-shot scenarios where traditional reinforcement learning (RL) methods struggle to perform effectively. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative for AIGB by leveraging their in-context learning capabilities to generalize from limited data. However, they lack the numerical precision required for fine-grained optimization. To address this limitation, we introduce GRPO-Adaptive, an efficient LLM post-training strategy that enhances both reasoning and numerical precision by dynamically updating the reference policy during training. Built upon this foundation, we further propose DARA, a novel dual-phase framework that decomposes the decision-making process into two stages: a few-shot reasoner that generates initial plans via in-context prompting, and a fine-grained optimizer that refines these plans using feedback-driven reasoning. This separation allows DARA to combine LLMs' in-context learning strengths with precise adaptability required by AIGB tasks. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic data environments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing baselines in terms of cumulative advertiser value under budget constraints."}

We propose PhyloEvolve, an LLM-agent system that reframes GPU-oriented algorithm optimization as an In-Context Reinforcement Learning (ICRL) problem. This formulation enables trajectory-conditioned reuse of optimization experience without model retraining. PhyloEvolve integrates Algorithm Distillation and prompt-based Decision Transformers into an iterative workflow, treating sequences of algorithm modifications and performance feedback as first-class learning signals. To organize optimization history, we introduce a phylogenetic tree representation that captures inheritance, divergence, and recombination among algorithm variants, enabling backtracking, cross-lineage transfer, and reproducibility. The system combines elite trajectory pooling, multi-island parallel exploration, and containerized execution to balance exploration and exploitation across heterogeneous hardware. We evaluate PhyloEvolve on scientific computing workloads including PDE solvers, manifold learning, and spectral graph algorithms, demonstrating consistent improvements in runtime, memory efficiency, and correctness over baseline and evolutionary methods.

We evaluate this claim using controlled simulations that compare legacy keyword-based screening with semantic matching based on high-dimensional vector representations of resumes and job descriptions.\n  The results demonstrate substantial improvements in recall and overall matching efficiency without a corresponding loss in precision. Building on these findings, the paper proposes a candidate-side workforce operating architecture that standardizes, verifies, and semantically aligns human capital signals while remaining interoperable with existing recruitment infrastructure. The findings highlight the economic costs of outdated hiring systems and the potential gains from improving semantic alignment in labor market matching."}

Therefore, several polynomial-time tightening techniques, such as edge finding, not-first-not-last reasoning, and energetic reasoning, have been introduced for this constraint. In this work, we derive the first bound-consistent algorithm for the no-overlap constraint. By building on the no-overlap MDD defined by Ciré and van Hoeve, we extract bounds of the time window of the jobs, allowing us to tighten start and end times in time polynomial in the number of nodes of the MDD. Similarly, to bound the size and time-complexity, we limit the width of the MDD to a threshold, creating a relaxed MDD that can also be used to relax the bound-consistent filtering. Through experiments on a sequencing problem with time windows and a just-in-time objective ($1 \\mid r_j, d_j, \\bar{d}_j \\mid \\sum E_j + \\sum T_j$), we observe that the proposed filtering, even with a threshold on the width, achieves a stronger reduction in the number of nodes visited in the search tree compared to the previously proposed precedence-detection algorithm of Ciré and van Hoeve. The new filtering also appears to be complementary to classical propagation methods for the no-overlap constraint, allowing a substantial reduction in both the number of nodes and the solving time on several instances."}

Stochastic computation has been recently exploited for area-efficient hardware implementation, such as low-density parity-check (LDPC) decoders and image processors. However, power-and-area hungry two-step (analog-to-digital and digital-to-stochastic) converters are required for the analog to stochastic signal conversion. To realize a one-step conversion, an MTJ device is used as it inherently exhibits a probabilistic switching behavior between two resistance states. Exploiting the device-based probabilistic behavior, analog signals can be directly and area-efficiently converted to stochastic signals to mitigate the signal-conversion overhead. The analog-to-stochastic signal conversion is theoretically described and the conversion characteristic is evaluated using device and circuit parameters. In addition, the resistance variability of the MTJ device is considered in order to compensate the variability effect on the signal conversion. Based on the theoretical analysis, the analog-to-stochastic converter is designed in 90nm CMOS and 100nm MTJ technologies and is verified using a SPICE simulator (NS-SPICE) that handles both transistors and MTJ devices."}

Such shortcomings stem from two key factors: (1) methodological complexity - agent orchestration is performed using sequential, code-level execution that limits global system-level holistic reasoning and scales poorly with agent complexity - and (2) efficacy uncertainty - MAS are deployed without understanding if there are tangible benefits compared to single-agent systems (SAS). We propose MAS-Orchestra, a training-time framework that formulates MAS orchestration as a function-calling reinforcement learning problem with holistic orchestration, generating an entire MAS at once. In MAS-Orchestra, complex, goal-oriented sub-agents are abstracted as callable functions, enabling global reasoning over system structure while hiding internal execution details. To rigorously study when and why MAS are beneficial, we introduce MASBENCH, a controlled benchmark that characterizes tasks along five axes: Depth, Horizon, Breadth, Parallel, and Robustness. Our analysis reveals that MAS gains depend critically on task structure, verification protocols, and the capabilities of both orchestrator and sub-agents, rather than holding universally. Guided by these insights, MAS-Orchestra achieves consistent improvements on public benchmarks including mathematical reasoning, multi-hop QA, and search-based QA. Together, MAS-Orchestra and MASBENCH enable better training and understanding of MAS in the pursuit of multi-agent intelligence."}

Manual anonymization is time-consuming, inconsistent, and frequently omits critical identifiers. Existing automated tools tend to rely on pattern matching or fixed rules, which fail to capture context and may alter the meaning of the data. This study uses local LLMs to build a reliable, repeatable, and context-aware anonymization process for detecting and anonymizing sensitive data in qualitative transcripts. We introduce a Structured Framework for Adaptive Anonymizer (SFAA) that includes three steps: detection, classification, and adaptive anonymization. The SFAA incorporates four anonymization strategies: rule-based substitution, context-aware rewriting, generalization, and suppression. These strategies are applied based on the identifier type and the risk level. The identifiers handled by the SFAA are guided by major international privacy and research ethics standards, including the GDPR, HIPAA, and OECD guidelines. This study followed a dual-method evaluation that combined manual and LLM-assisted processing. Two case studies were used to support the evaluation. The first includes 82 face-to-face interviews on gamification in organizations. The second involves 93 machine-led interviews using an AI-powered interviewer to test LLM awareness and workplace privacy. Two local models, LLaMA and Phi were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework. The results indicate that the LLMs found more sensitive data than a human reviewer. Phi outperformed LLaMA in finding sensitive data, but made slightly more errors. Phi was able to find over 91% of the sensitive data and 94.8% kept the same sentiment as the original text, which means it was very accurate, hence, it does not affect the analysis of the qualitative data."}

Although large language models (LLMs) offer rich semantic understanding for free-form recommendation, applying them to long-horizon LPR is challenging due to (i) misalignment with pedagogical objectives such as the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) under sparse, delayed feedback, (ii) scarce and costly expert demonstrations, and (iii) multi-objective interactions among learning effect, difficulty scheduling, length controllability, and trajectory diversity. To address these issues, we propose IB-GRPO (Indicator-Based Group Relative Policy Optimization), an indicator-guided alignment approach for LLM-based LPR. To mitigate data scarcity, we construct hybrid expert demonstrations via Genetic Algorithm search and teacher RL agents and warm-start the LLM with supervised fine-tuning. Building on this warm-start, we design a within-session ZPD alignment score for difficulty scheduling. IB-GRPO then uses the $I_{ε+}$ dominance indicator to compute group-relative advantages over multiple objectives, avoiding manual scalarization and improving Pareto trade-offs.

We introduce a practical method for evaluating awareness across diverse systems, where awareness is understood as encompassing a system's abilities to process, store and use information in the service of goal-directed action. Central to this approach is the claim that any evaluation aiming to capture the diversity of artificial systems must be domain-sensitive, deployable at any scale, multidimensional, and enable the prediction of task performance, while generalising to the level of abilities for the sake of comparison. Given these four desiderata, we outline a structured approach to evaluating and comparing awareness profiles across artificial systems with differing architectures, scales, and operational domains. By shifting the focus from artificial consciousness to being just aware enough, this approach aims to facilitate principled assessment, support design and oversight, and enable more constructive scientific and public discourse."}

This paradigm implicitly assumes that the agent's CoT faithfully reflects both its internal reasoning and the underlying environment state. We show this assumption is brittle: LLM judges are highly susceptible to manipulation of agent reasoning traces. By systematically rewriting agent CoTs while holding actions and observations fixed, we demonstrate that manipulated reasoning alone can inflate false positive rates of state-of-the-art VLM judges by up to 90% across 800 trajectories spanning diverse web tasks. We study manipulation strategies spanning style-based approaches that alter only the presentation of reasoning and content-based approaches that fabricate signals of task progress, and find that content-based manipulations are consistently more effective. We evaluate prompting-based techniques and scaling judge-time compute, which reduce but do not fully eliminate susceptibility to manipulation. Our findings reveal a fundamental vulnerability in LLM-based evaluation and highlight the need for judging mechanisms that verify reasoning claims against observable evidence."}

The transitions between these behaviors offer valuable insights into user-item interactions, serving as a key signal for understanding evolving preferences. Consequently, there is growing interest in leveraging multi-behavior data to better capture user intent. Recent studies have explored sequential modeling of multi-behavior data, many relying on transformer-based architectures with polynomial time complexity. While effective, these approaches often incur high computational costs, limiting their applicability in large-scale industrial systems with long user sequences. To address this challenge, we propose the Transition-Aware Graph Attention Network (TGA), a linear-complexity approach for modeling multi-behavior transitions. Unlike traditional transformers that treat all behavior pairs equally, TGA constructs a structured sparse graph by identifying informative transitions from three perspectives: (a) item-level transitions, (b) category-level transitions, and (c) neighbor-level transitions. Built upon the structured graph, TGA employs a transition-aware graph Attention mechanism that jointly models user-item interactions and behavior transition types, enabling more accurate capture of sequential patterns while maintaining computational efficiency. Experiments show that TGA outperforms all state-of-the-art models while significantly reducing computational cost. Notably, TGA has been deployed in a large-scale industrial production environment, where it leads to impressive improvements in key business metrics."}

Recent vision-language models (VLMs) demonstrate reasoning and generalization abilities, opening new possibilities for autonomous driving; however, existing benchmarks and metrics overemphasize perceptual competence and fail to adequately assess decision-making processes. In this work, we present AutoDriDM, a decision-centric, progressive benchmark with 6,650 questions across three dimensions - Object, Scene, and Decision. We evaluate mainstream VLMs to delineate the perception-to-decision capability boundary in autonomous driving, and our correlation analysis reveals weak alignment between perception and decision-making performance. We further conduct explainability analyses of models' reasoning processes, identifying key failure modes such as logical reasoning errors, and introduce an analyzer model to automate large-scale annotation. AutoDriDM bridges the gap between perception-centered and decision-centered evaluation, providing guidance toward safer and more reliable VLMs for real-world autonomous driving."}

In this paper, we draw on Barad's agential realism to develop an alternative onto-epistemology of XAI. We propose that interpretations are material-discursive performances that emerge from situated entanglements of the AI model with humans, context, and the interpretative apparatus. To develop this position, we read a comprehensive set of XAI methods through agential realism and reveal the assumptions and limitations that underpin several of these methods. We then articulate the framework's ethical dimension and propose design directions for XAI interfaces that support emergent interpretation, using a speculative text-to-music interface as a case study."}

Advertisers often have personalized objectives but limited historical interaction data, resulting in few-shot scenarios where traditional reinforcement learning (RL) methods struggle to perform effectively. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative for AIGB by leveraging their in-context learning capabilities to generalize from limited data. However, they lack the numerical precision required for fine-grained optimization. To address this limitation, we introduce GRPO-Adaptive, an efficient LLM post-training strategy that enhances both reasoning and numerical precision by dynamically updating the reference policy during training. Built upon this foundation, we further propose DARA, a novel dual-phase framework that decomposes the decision-making process into two stages: a few-shot reasoner that generates initial plans via in-context prompting, and a fine-grained optimizer that refines these plans using feedback-driven reasoning. This separation allows DARA to combine LLMs' in-context learning strengths with precise adaptability required by AIGB tasks. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic data environments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing baselines in terms of cumulative advertiser value under budget constraints."}

Decisions are executed through formally correct approval processes, yet no entity possesses both the authority to approve those decisions and the epistemic capacity to meaningfully understand their basis.\n  We define this condition as responsibility vacuum: a state in which decisions occur, but responsibility cannot be attributed because authority and verification capacity do not coincide. We show that this is not a process deviation or technical defect, but a structural property of deployments where decision generation throughput exceeds bounded human verification capacity.\n  We identify a scaling limit under standard deployment assumptions, including parallel agent generation, CI-based validation, and individualized human approval gates. Beyond a throughput threshold, verification ceases to function as a decision criterion and is replaced by ritualized approval based on proxy signals. Personalized responsibility becomes structurally unattainable in this regime.\n  We further characterize a CI amplification dynamic, whereby increasing automated validation coverage raises proxy signal density without restoring human capacity. Under fixed time and attention constraints, this accelerates cognitive offloading in the broad sense and widens the gap between formal approval and epistemic understanding. Additional automation therefore amplifies, rather than mitigates, the responsibility vacuum.\n  We conclude that unless organizations explicitly redesign decision boundaries or reassign responsibility away from individual decisions toward batch- or system-level ownership, responsibility vacuum remains an invisible but persistent failure mode in scaled agent deployments."}

We validate our framework across a diverse suite of agentic scenarios, including standard tool use and subtle reliability risks like memory-induced bias.

Therefore, several polynomial-time tightening techniques, such as edge finding, not-first-not-last reasoning, and energetic reasoning, have been introduced for this constraint. In this work, we derive the first bound-consistent algorithm for the no-overlap constraint. By building on the no-overlap MDD defined by Ciré and van Hoeve, we extract bounds of the time window of the jobs, allowing us to tighten start and end times in time polynomial in the number of nodes of the MDD. Similarly, to bound the size and time-complexity, we limit the width of the MDD to a threshold, creating a relaxed MDD that can also be used to relax the bound-consistent filtering. Through experiments on a sequencing problem with time windows and a just-in-time objective ($1 \\mid r_j, d_j, \\bar{d}_j \\mid \\sum E_j + \\sum T_j$), we observe that the proposed filtering, even with a threshold on the width, achieves a stronger reduction in the number of nodes visited in the search tree compared to the previously proposed precedence-detection algorithm of Ciré and van Hoeve. The new filtering also appears to be complementary to classical propagation methods for the no-overlap constraint, allowing a substantial reduction in both the number of nodes and the solving time on several instances."}

This paper introduces Component Interface for Agent (CI4A), a semantic encapsulation mechanism that abstracts the complex interaction logic of UI components into a set of unified tool primitives accessible to agents. We implemented CI4A within Ant Design, an industrial-grade front-end framework, covering 23 categories of commonly used UI components. Furthermore, we developed a hybrid agent featuring an action space that dynamically updates according to the page state, enabling flexible invocation of available CI4A tools. Leveraging the CI4A-integrated Ant Design, we refactored and upgraded the WebArena benchmark to evaluate existing SoTA methods. Experimental results demonstrate that the CI4A-based agent significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving a new SoTA task success rate of 86.3%, alongside substantial improvements in execution efficiency."}

In this routing problem, the objective is to maximize the number of customer requests served within a finite time horizon. We present a novel routing network embedding module which creates local node embedding vectors and a context-aware global graph representation. The proposed Markov decision process for the vehicle routing problem incorporates the node features, the network adjacency matrix and the edge features as components of the state space. We incorporate the remaining finite time horizon into the network embedding module to provide a proper routing context to the embedding module. We integrate our embedding module with a policy gradient-based deep Reinforcement Learning framework to solve the vehicle routing problem with finite time horizon. We trained and validated our proposed routing method on real-world routing networks, as well as synthetically generated Euclidean networks. Our experimental results show that our method achieves a higher customer service rate than the existing routing methods. Additionally, the solution time of our method is significantly lower than that of the existing methods."}

Non-experts struggle to create effective visualizations, leading to suboptimal insights and diverting expert time. This paper investigates how to capture and embed human domain knowledge into AI agent systems through an industrial case study. We propose a software engineering framework to capture human domain knowledge for engineering AI agents in simulation data visualization by augmenting a Large Language Model (LLM) with a request classifier, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for code generation, codified expert rules, and visualization design principles unified in an agent demonstrating autonomous, reactive, proactive, and social behavior. Evaluation across five scenarios spanning multiple engineering domains with 12 evaluators demonstrates 206% improvement in output quality, with our agent achieving expert-level ratings in all cases versus baseline's poor performance, while maintaining superior code quality with lower variance. Our contributions are: an automated agent-based system for visualization generation and a validated framework for systematically capturing human domain knowledge and codifying tacit expert knowledge into AI agents, demonstrating that non-experts can achieve expert-level outcomes in specialized domains."}

We propose the Immersive Code Learning Framework (ICLF), a scalable Git-based organizational pipeline for managing and evaluating student programming project. Students begin with an existing code base, a practice that is crucial for mirroring real-world software development. Students then iteratively complete tasks that pass predefined tests. The instructor only manages a hidden parent repository containing solutions, which is used to generate an intermediate public repository with these solutions removed via a templating system. Students are invited collaborators on private forks of this intermediate repository, possibly updated throughout the semester whenever the teacher changes the parent repository. This approach reduces grading platform dependency, supports automated feedback, and allows the project to evolve without disrupting student work. Successfully tested over several years, including in an edX MOOC, this organizational pipeline provides transparent evaluation, plagiarism detection, and continuous progress tracking for each student."}

We propose a bottom-up learning paradigm in which models are grounded in axiomatic domain facts and compose them to solve complex, unseen tasks. To this end, we present a post-training pipeline, based on a combination of supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning (RL), in which knowledge graphs act as implicit reward models. By deriving novel reward signals from knowledge graph paths, we provide verifiable, scalable, and grounded supervision that encourages models to compose intermediate axioms rather than optimize only final answers during RL. We validate this approach in the medical domain, training a 14B model on short-hop reasoning paths (1-3 hops) and evaluating its zero-shot generalization to complex multi-hop queries (4-5 hops). Our experiments show that path-derived rewards act as a \"compositional bridge\", enabling our model to significantly outperform much larger models and frontier systems like GPT-5.2 and Gemini 3 Pro, on the most difficult reasoning tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate the robustness of our approach to adversarial perturbations against option-shuffling stress tests. This work suggests that grounding the reasoning process in structured knowledge is a scalable and efficient path toward intelligent reasoning."}

We identify a critical pathology in current training paradigms where goal-driven data collection creates a dataset bias. In such datasets, language instructions are highly predictable from visual observations alone, causing the conditional mutual information between instructions and actions to vanish, a phenomenon we term Information Collapse. Consequently, models degenerate into vision-only policies that ignore language constraints and fail in out-of-distribution (OOD) settings. To address this, we propose BayesianVLA, a novel framework that enforces instruction following via Bayesian decomposition. By introducing learnable Latent Action Queries, we construct a dual-branch architecture to estimate both a vision-only prior $p(a \\mid v)$ and a language-conditioned posterior $π(a \\mid v, \\ell)$. We then optimize the policy to maximize the conditional Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) between actions and instructions. This objective effectively penalizes the vision shortcut and rewards actions that explicitly explain the language command. Without requiring new data, BayesianVLA significantly improves generalization. Extensive experiments across on SimplerEnv and RoboCasa demonstrate substantial gains, including an 11.3% improvement on the challenging OOD SimplerEnv benchmark, validating the ability of our approach to robustly ground language in action."}

At the same time, distinctly non-human signatures emerged: loss aversion dropped below neutral levels, choices became more deterministic than in humans, affective decay increased across versions and exceeded human levels, and baseline mood remained chronically higher than in humans.

We introduce a practical method for evaluating awareness across diverse systems, where awareness is understood as encompassing a system's abilities to process, store and use information in the service of goal-directed action. Central to this approach is the claim that any evaluation aiming to capture the diversity of artificial systems must be domain-sensitive, deployable at any scale, multidimensional, and enable the prediction of task performance, while generalising to the level of abilities for the sake of comparison. Given these four desiderata, we outline a structured approach to evaluating and comparing awareness profiles across artificial systems with differing architectures, scales, and operational domains. By shifting the focus from artificial consciousness to being just aware enough, this approach aims to facilitate principled assessment, support design and oversight, and enable more constructive scientific and public discourse."}

While recursion is precisely defined in mathematics and computer science, it has not previously been formalized as an aesthetic paradigm. Recursivism designates practices in which not only outputs vary over time, but in which the generative process itself becomes capable of reflexive modification through its own effects.\n  The paper develops a five-level analytical scale distinguishing simple iteration, cumulative iteration, parametric recursion, reflexive recursion, and meta-recursion. This scale clarifies the threshold at which a system shifts from variation within a fixed rule to genuine self-modification of the rule itself. From this perspective, art history is reinterpreted as a recursive dynamic alternating between internal recursion within movements and meta-recursive transformations of their generative principles.\n  Artificial intelligence renders this logic technically explicit through learning loops, parameter updates, and code-level self-modification. To distinguish Recursivism from related notions such as generative art, cybernetics, process art, and evolutionary art, the article proposes three operational criteria: state memory, rule evolvability, and reflexive visibility. These concepts are examined through case studies including Refik Anadol, Sougwen Chung, Karl Sims, and the Darwin-Godel Machine. The article concludes by examining the aesthetic, curatorial, and ethical implications of self-modifying artistic systems."}

The transitions between these behaviors offer valuable insights into user-item interactions, serving as a key signal for understanding evolving preferences. Consequently, there is growing interest in leveraging multi-behavior data to better capture user intent. Recent studies have explored sequential modeling of multi-behavior data, many relying on transformer-based architectures with polynomial time complexity. While effective, these approaches often incur high computational costs, limiting their applicability in large-scale industrial systems with long user sequences. To address this challenge, we propose the Transition-Aware Graph Attention Network (TGA), a linear-complexity approach for modeling multi-behavior transitions. Unlike traditional transformers that treat all behavior pairs equally, TGA constructs a structured sparse graph by identifying informative transitions from three perspectives: (a) item-level transitions, (b) category-level transitions, and (c) neighbor-level transitions. Built upon the structured graph, TGA employs a transition-aware graph Attention mechanism that jointly models user-item interactions and behavior transition types, enabling more accurate capture of sequential patterns while maintaining computational efficiency. Experiments show that TGA outperforms all state-of-the-art models while significantly reducing computational cost. Notably, TGA has been deployed in a large-scale industrial production environment, where it leads to impressive improvements in key business metrics."}

Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference (FIMI) and related hybrid activities are conducted across various societal dimensions and infospheres, posing an ever greater challenge to the characterization of threats, sustaining situational awareness, and response coordination. Recent advances in AI have further led to the decreasing cost of AI-augmented trolling and interference activities, such as through the generation and amplification of manipulative content.

We propose a framework-agnostic agent-based operationalization of DISARM to investigate FIMI on social media. We develop a multi-agent pipeline in which specialized agentic AI components collaboratively (1) detect candidate manipulative behaviors, and (2) map these behaviors onto standard DISARM taxonomies in a transparent manner.

We show that subdiffusive transport on graphs is a memory-driven process generated by a random time change that compresses operational time, produces long-tailed waiting times, and breaks Markovianity while preserving linearity and mass conservation. We prove that Mittag-Leffler graph dynamics admit an exact convex, mass-preserving representation as a superposition of classical heat semigroups evaluated at rescaled times, revealing fractional diffusion as ordinary diffusion acting across multiple intrinsic time scales. This framework uncovers heterogeneous, vertex-dependent memory effects and induces transport biases absent in classical diffusion, including algebraic relaxation, degree-dependent waiting times, and early-time asymmetries between sources and neighbors. These features define a subdiffusive geometry on graphs enabling particles to locally discover global shortest paths while favoring high-degree regions. Finally, we show that time-fractional diffusion arises as a singular limit of multi-rate diffusion."}

In this paper, we draw on Barad's agential realism to develop an alternative onto-epistemology of XAI. We propose that interpretations are material-discursive performances that emerge from situated entanglements of the AI model with humans, context, and the interpretative apparatus. To develop this position, we read a comprehensive set of XAI methods through agential realism and reveal the assumptions and limitations that underpin several of these methods.

Decisions are executed through formally correct approval processes, yet no entity possesses both the authority to approve those decisions and the epistemic capacity to meaningfully understand their basis.\n  We define this condition as responsibility vacuum: a state in which decisions occur, but responsibility cannot be attributed because authority and verification capacity do not coincide. We show that this is not a process deviation or technical defect, but a structural property of deployments where decision generation throughput exceeds bounded human verification capacity.\n  We identify a scaling limit under standard deployment assumptions, including parallel agent generation, CI-based validation, and individualized human approval gates. Beyond a throughput threshold, verification ceases to function as a decision criterion and is replaced by ritualized approval based on proxy signals. Personalized responsibility becomes structurally unattainable in this regime.\n  We further characterize a CI amplification dynamic, whereby increasing automated validation coverage raises proxy signal density without restoring human capacity. Under fixed time and attention constraints, this accelerates cognitive offloading in the broad sense and widens the gap between formal approval and epistemic understanding. Additional automation therefore amplifies, rather than mitigates, the responsibility vacuum.\n  We conclude that unless organizations explicitly redesign decision boundaries or reassign responsibility away from individual decisions toward batch- or system-level ownership, responsibility vacuum remains an invisible but persistent failure mode in scaled agent deployments."}

However, existing research predominantly focuses on \\textit{failure attribution} to localize explicit errors in unsuccessful trajectories, which is insufficient for explaining the reasoning behind agent behaviors. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework for \\textbf{general agentic attribution}, designed to identify the internal factors driving agent actions regardless of the task outcome. Our framework operates hierarchically to manage the complexity of agent interactions. Specifically, at the \\textit{component level}, we employ temporal likelihood dynamics to identify critical interaction steps; then at the \\textit{sentence level}, we refine this localization using perturbation-based analysis to isolate the specific textual evidence. We validate our framework across a diverse suite of agentic scenarios, including standard tool use and subtle reliability risks like memory-induced bias. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework reliably pinpoints pivotal historical events and sentences behind the agent behavior, offering a critical step toward safer and more accountable agentic systems."}

Segura"], "title": "Computable Structuralism: A Categorical Rewrite Calculus of Mythic Variants", "comment": null, "summary": "Structural approaches to myth and narrative are compelling in close reading but hard to compare across traditions, media, and scale. We propose a formal framework that renders Lévi-Straussian transformation as mathematics while remaining readable as narrative analysis. Variants, superhero continuities, and franchise arcs are modeled as typed rewrite programs on a coupled two-register state $(X,Y)$, abstracting an everyday/social channel and a symbolic/legitimation channel. The canonical formula becomes coherence data: a natural transformation $η:U\\Rightarrow V$ between update endofunctors, where $U$ updates each register in place and $V$ performs a swap+inversion. Context is internalized by operator choice, turning naturality into a corpus-facing type check: failures diagnose mis-specified oppositions or illegal transport; successes witness coherent structural models. Order effects are summarized by a five-value invariant (Key). We apply the method to 80 narratives (20 folktales, 20 religious myths, 20 superheroes, 20 franchises), each encoded as $(a,b,x,y)$ with a Key. 59/80 (74\\%) explicitly name a normative constraint in $y$ (law, taboo, contract, prophecy), supporting the two-register abstraction. The result is a testable bridge between structural anthropology and cultural analytics: stories remain interpretable yet become transportable objects for computation, comparison, and falsifiable constraints on transformation."}

Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference (FIMI) and related hybrid activities are conducted across various societal dimensions and infospheres, posing an ever greater challenge to the characterization of threats, sustaining situational awareness, and response coordination. Recent advances in AI have further led to the decreasing cost of AI-augmented trolling and interference activities, such as through the generation and amplification of manipulative content. Despite the introduction of the DISARM framework as a standardized metadata and analytical framework for FIMI, operationalizing it at the scale of social media remains a challenge. We propose a framework-agnostic agent-based operationalization of DISARM to investigate FIMI on social media. We develop a multi-agent pipeline in which specialized agentic AI components collaboratively (1) detect candidate manipulative behaviors, and (2) map these behaviors onto standard DISARM taxonomies in a transparent manner. We evaluated the approach on two real-world datasets annotated by domain practitioners. We demonstrate that our approach is effective in scaling the predominantly manual and heavily interpretive work of FIMI analysis, providing a direct contribution to enhancing the situational awareness and data interoperability in the context of operating in media and information-rich settings."}

Beyond obvious failures, the subtle issue of \"intent deviation\" severely hinders reliable evaluation and performance improvement. Existing post-training methods generally leverage either real system samples or virtual data simulated by LLMs. However, the former is costly due to reliance on hand-crafted user requests, while the latter suffers from distribution shift from the real tools in the wild. Additionally, both methods lack negative samples tailored to intent deviation scenarios, hindering effective guidance on preference learning. We introduce RISE, a \"Real-to-Virtual\" method designed to mitigate intent deviation. Anchoring on verified tool primitives, RISE synthesizes virtual trajectories and generates diverse negative samples through mutation on critical parameters. With synthetic data, RISE fine-tunes backbone LLMs via the two-stage training for intent alignment. Evaluation results demonstrate that data synthesized by RISE achieve promising results in eight metrics covering user requires, execution trajectories and agent responses. Integrating with training, RISE achieves an average 35.28% improvement in Acctask (task completion) and 23.27% in Accintent (intent alignment), outperforming SOTA baselines by 1.20--42.09% and 1.17--54.93% respectively."}

This article defines the \"Plausibility Trap\": a phenomenon where individuals with access to Artificial Intelligence (AI) models deploy expensive probabilistic engines for simple deterministic tasks-such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR) or basic verification-resulting in significant resource waste. Through micro-benchmarks and case studies on OCR and fact-checking, we quantify the \"efficiency tax\"-demonstrating a ~6.5x latency penalty-and the risks of algorithmic sycophancy. To counter this, we introduce Tool Selection Engineering and the Deterministic-Probabilistic Decision Matrix, a framework to help developers determine when to use Generative AI and, crucially, when to avoid it. We argue for a curriculum shift, emphasizing that true digital literacy relies not only in knowing how to use Generative AI, but also on knowing when not to use it."}

In this routing problem, the objective is to maximize the number of customer requests served within a finite time horizon. We present a novel routing network embedding module which creates local node embedding vectors and a context-aware global graph representation. The proposed Markov decision process for the vehicle routing problem incorporates the node features, the network adjacency matrix and the edge features as components of the state space. We incorporate the remaining finite time horizon into the network embedding module to provide a proper routing context to the embedding module. We integrate our embedding module with a policy gradient-based deep Reinforcement Learning framework to solve the vehicle routing problem with finite time horizon. We trained and validated our proposed routing method on real-world routing networks, as well as synthetically generated Euclidean networks. Our experimental results show that our method achieves a higher customer service rate than the existing routing methods. Additionally, the solution time of our method is significantly lower than that of the existing methods."}

A Software Engineering Framework", "comment": null, "summary": "Critical domain knowledge typically resides with few experts, creating organizational bottlenecks in scalability and decision-making. Non-experts struggle to create effective visualizations, leading to suboptimal insights and diverting expert time. This paper investigates how to capture and embed human domain knowledge into AI agent systems through an industrial case study. We propose a software engineering framework to capture human domain knowledge for engineering AI agents in simulation data visualization by augmenting a Large Language Model (LLM) with a request classifier, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for code generation, codified expert rules, and visualization design principles unified in an agent demonstrating autonomous, reactive, proactive, and social behavior. Evaluation across five scenarios spanning multiple engineering domains with 12 evaluators demonstrates 206% improvement in output quality, with our agent achieving expert-level ratings in all cases versus baseline's poor performance, while maintaining superior code quality with lower variance. Our contributions are: an automated agent-based system for visualization generation and a validated framework for systematically capturing human domain knowledge and codifying tacit expert knowledge into AI agents, demonstrating that non-experts can achieve expert-level outcomes in specialized domains."}

We propose a bottom-up learning paradigm in which models are grounded in axiomatic domain facts and compose them to solve complex, unseen tasks. To this end, we present a post-training pipeline, based on a combination of supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning (RL), in which knowledge graphs act as implicit reward models. By deriving novel reward signals from knowledge graph paths, we provide verifiable, scalable, and grounded supervision that encourages models to compose intermediate axioms rather than optimize only final answers during RL. We validate this approach in the medical domain, training a 14B model on short-hop reasoning paths (1-3 hops) and evaluating its zero-shot generalization to complex multi-hop queries (4-5 hops). Our experiments show that path-derived rewards act as a \"compositional bridge\", enabling our model to significantly outperform much larger models and frontier systems like GPT-5.2 and Gemini 3 Pro, on the most difficult reasoning tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate the robustness of our approach to adversarial perturbations against option-shuffling stress tests. This work suggests that grounding the reasoning process in structured knowledge is a scalable and efficient path toward intelligent reasoning."}

We identify a critical pathology in current training paradigms where goal-driven data collection creates a dataset bias. In such datasets, language instructions are highly predictable from visual observations alone, causing the conditional mutual information between instructions and actions to vanish, a phenomenon we term Information Collapse. Consequently, models degenerate into vision-only policies that ignore language constraints and fail in out-of-distribution (OOD) settings. To address this, we propose BayesianVLA, a novel framework that enforces instruction following via Bayesian decomposition. By introducing learnable Latent Action Queries, we construct a dual-branch architecture to estimate both a vision-only prior $p(a \\mid v)$ and a language-conditioned posterior $π(a \\mid v, \\ell)$. We then optimize the policy to maximize the conditional Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) between actions and instructions. This objective effectively penalizes the vision shortcut and rewards actions that explicitly explain the language command. Without requiring new data, BayesianVLA significantly improves generalization. Extensive experiments across on SimplerEnv and RoboCasa demonstrate substantial gains, including an 11.3% improvement on the challenging OOD SimplerEnv benchmark, validating the ability of our approach to robustly ground language in action."}

While LLMs show strong potential in handling legal knowledge and tasks, their deployment in real-world legal settings raises critical concerns beyond surface-level accuracy, involving the soundness of legal reasoning processes and trustworthy issues such as fairness and reliability. Systematic evaluation of LLM performance in legal tasks has therefore become essential for their responsible adoption. This survey identifies key challenges in evaluating LLMs for legal tasks grounded in real-world legal practice. We analyze the major difficulties involved in assessing LLM performance in the legal domain, including outcome correctness, reasoning reliability, and trustworthiness. Building on these challenges, we review and categorize existing evaluation methods and benchmarks according to their task design, datasets, and evaluation metrics. We further discuss the extent to which current approaches address these challenges, highlight their limitations, and outline future research directions toward more realistic, reliable, and legally grounded evaluation frameworks for LLMs in legal domains."}
