This multi-method study systematically analyzes adminship across 284 Wikipedia languages since 2018, revealing a critical two-sided trend: while over half of all Wikipedias show a net increase in administrators, almost two-thirds of highly active Wikipedias face decline. Our analysis, drawing from large-scale adminship log analysis, over 3000 surveys, and 12 interviews, reveals this decline is primarily driven by insufficient recruitment, not unusual attrition. We identify key barriers for potential administrators, including limited awareness, ambiguous requirements, a demanding selection process, and low initial interest. Recognizing that current administrators remain highly motivated and engaged, we propose actionable recommendations to strengthen recruitment pipelines and fuel Wikipedia administrator growth, crucial for Wikipedia's long-term sustainability."}

We examine schadenfreude on Facebook over a ten-year period across nine major news publishers in the United States, the United Kingdom, and India (one left-leaning, one right-leaning, and one centrist per country). Using a combination of human annotation and machine-learning classification, we identify posts describing misfortune and detect schadenfreude in nearly one million associated comments. We find that while sadness and anger dominate reactions to misfortune posts, laughter and amusement form a substantial and patterned minority. Schadenfreude is most frequent in moralized and political contexts, higher among right-leaning audiences, and more pronounced in India than in the United States or United Kingdom. Temporal and regression analyses further reveal that schadenfreude generally increases when groups are politically out of power, but these patterns differ across party lines. Together, our findings move beyond anecdotal accounts to map schadenfreude as a dynamic, context-dependent feature of digital discourse, revealing how it evolves over time and across ideological and cultural divides."}

Such human-AI collective knowledge ecosystems contain feedback loops with both benefits (e.g., faster growth, easier learning) and systemic risks (e.g., quality dilution, skill reduction, model collapse). To understand such phenomena, we propose a minimal, interpretable dynamical model of the co-evolution of archive size, archive quality, model (LLM) skill, aggregate human skill, and query volume. The model captures two content inflows (human, LLM) controlled by a gate on LLM-content admissions, two learning pathways for humans (archive study vs. LLM assistance), and two LLM-training modalities (corpus-driven scaling vs. learning from human feedback). Through numerical experiments, we identify different growth regimes (e.g., healthy growth, inverted flow, inverted learning, oscillations), and show how platform and policy levers (gate strictness, LLM training, human learning pathways) shift the system across regime boundaries. Two domain configurations (PubMed, GitHub and Copilot) illustrate contrasting steady states under different growth rates and moderation norms. We also fit the model to Wikipedia's knowledge flow during pre-ChatGPT and post-ChatGPT eras separately. We find a rise in LLM additions with a concurrent decline in human inflow, consistent with a regime identified by the model. Our model and analysis yield actionable insights for sustainable growth of human-AI collective knowledge on the Web."}

However, large-scale networks present unique challenges: they contain hundreds of thousands of nodes and edges with heterogeneous and overlapping community structures that evolve over time. Existing approaches face notable limitations: traditional graph neural networks struggle to capture global structural dependencies, while recent graph transformers achieve strong performance but incur quadratic complexity and lack interpretable latent structure. We propose \\textbf{TGSBM} (Transformer-Guided Stochastic Block Model), a framework that integrates the principled generative structure of Overlapping Stochastic Block Models with the representational power of sparse Graph Transformers. TGSBM comprises three main components: (i) \\emph{expander-augmented sparse attention} that enables near-linear complexity and efficient global mixing, (ii) a \\emph{neural variational encoder} that infers structured posteriors over community memberships and strengths, and (iii) a \\emph{neural edge decoder} that reconstructs links via OSBM's generative process, preserving interpretability. Experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate competitive performance (mean rank 1.6 under HeaRT protocol), superior scalability (up to $6\\times$ faster training), and interpretable community structures. These results position TGSBM as a practical approach that strikes a balance between accuracy, efficiency, and transparency for large-scale link prediction."}

Using country-level indicators and public opinion data from 125 countries, we benchmark four state-of-the-art LLMs against Gallup World Poll 2021/22 data and statistical regressions. LLMs, particularly Claude, accurately capture public perceptions of others' willingness to contribute financially to climate action (MAE approximately 5 p.p.; r = .77), comparable to statistical models, though performance declines in less digitally connected, lower-GDP countries. Controlled tests show that LLMs capture the key psychological process - social projection with a systematic downward bias - and rely on structured reasoning rather than memorized values. Overall, LLMs provide a rapid tool for assessing perception gaps in climate action, serving as an alternative to costly surveys in resource-rich countries and as a complement in underrepresented populations."}

Existing evidence is mixed, reflecting limited treated countries, long horizons that challenge inference, and heterogeneity across member states. We estimate causal dynamic and heterogeneous treatment effects using Causal Forests with Fixed Effects (CFFE), a machine-learning approach that combines causal forests with two-way fixed effects. Under a conditional parallel-trends assumption, we find that euro adoption reduced annual GDP growth by 0.3-0.4 percentage points on average. Effects emerge shortly after adoption and stabilize after roughly a decade.\n  Average effects mask substantial heterogeneity. Countries with lower initial GDP per capita experience larger and more persistent growth shortfalls than core economies. Weaker consumption and productivity growth contribute to the overall effect, while improvements in net exports partially offset these declines.\n  A two-country New Keynesian DSGE model with hysteresis generates qualitatively similar patterns: one-size-fits-all monetary policy and scarring mechanisms produce larger output losses under monetary union than under flexible exchange rates. By jointly estimating dynamic and heterogeneous treatment effects, the analysis highlights the importance of country characteristics in assessing the long-run consequences of monetary union."}

Paxton upheld the constitutionality of Texas H.B. 1181, one of the most constitutionally vulnerable of these age verification laws, holding that it was subject to and satisfied intermediate scrutiny and the requirement that age verification regulations be \"adequately tailored\". However, the decision leaves unresolved practical challenges. What is the current state of age verification legislation in the United States? How can \"adequate tailoring\" be interpreted in a way that is accessible to non-legal experts, particularly those in technical and engineering domains? What age verification approaches are used today, what infrastructures and standards support them, and what tradeoffs do they introduce? This paper addresses those questions by proposing an analytical model to interpret \"adequate tailoring\" from multiple perspectives with associated governmental goals and interests, and by applying that model to evaluate both current state laws and widely used verification methods. This paper's major contributions include: (1) we mapped the current U.S. age-verification legislative landscape; (2) we introduce an analytical model to analyze \"adequate tailoring\" for age verification and potential application to other online regulatory policies; and (3) we analyze the main technical approaches to age verification, highlighting the practical challenges and tradeoffs from a technical perspective. Further, while we focus on U.S. State laws, the principles underlying our framework are applicable to age-verification debates and methods worldwide."}

If the entire sample path of the process is available, and under a set of weak conditions, our statistic is consistent and has a mixed Gaussian limit, whose precision is five times greater than that of realized variance. In practice, of course, inference is drawn from discrete data and true ranges are unobserved, leading to downward bias. We solve this problem to get a consistent, mixed normal estimator, irrespective of non-trading effects. This estimator has varying degrees of efficiency over realized variance, depending on how many observations that are used to construct the high-low. The methodology is applied to TAQ data and compared with realized variance. Our findings suggest that the empirical path of quadratic variation is also estimated better with the realized range-based variance."}

Novice workers who rely heavily on AI to complete unfamiliar tasks may compromise their own skill acquisition in the process. We conduct randomized experiments to study how developers gained mastery of a new asynchronous programming library with and without the assistance of AI. We find that AI use impairs conceptual understanding, code reading, and debugging abilities, without delivering significant efficiency gains on average. Participants who fully delegated coding tasks showed some productivity improvements, but at the cost of learning the library. We identify six distinct AI interaction patterns, three of which involve cognitive engagement and preserve learning outcomes even when participants receive AI assistance. Our findings suggest that AI-enhanced productivity is not a shortcut to competence and AI assistance should be carefully adopted into workflows to preserve skill formation -- particularly in safety-critical domains."}

In a double-asymptotic framework, with time also increasing to infinity, the REDF converges to the cumulative distribution function of volatility, if it exists. We exploit these results to construct some new goodness-of-fit tests for stochastic volatility models. In a Monte Carlo study, the REDF is found to be accurate over the entire support of volatility. This leads to goodness-of-fit tests that are both correctly sized and relatively powerful against common alternatives. In an empirical application, we recover the REDF from stock market high-frequency data. We inspect the goodness-of-fit of several two-parameter marginal distributions that are inherent in standard stochastic volatility models. The inverse Gaussian offers the best overall description of random equity variation, but the fit is less than perfect. This suggests an extra parameter (as available in, e.g., the generalized inverse Gaussian) is required to model stochastic variance."}

We used Monte Carlo simulation to compare treatment effect estimates from an SNT emulation that re-indexed patients annually and a SNT emulation with a treatment decision design to the estimates from a single point trial. We generated 5,000 cohorts of 5,000 people with 3 years of follow-up. For the single point trial, patients were randomized to initiate or not initiate treatment at Visit 1. For the SNT emulations, simulated patients could contribute up to two index dates. When disease severity did not modify the treatment effect, both SNT approaches returned treatment effect estimates identical to the single point trial. In the presence of treatment effect modification by disease severity, both SNT approaches returned treatment effect estimates that diverged from the single point trial even after confounding-adjustment. These findings underscore the difficulties of interpreting causal estimands from a SNT emulation: the target population does not correspond to a single time point trial. Such implications are important for communicating study results for evidence-based decision-making."}

We propose Fuzzy Category-theoretic Planning (FCP), which annotates each action (morphism) with a degree in [0,1], composes plan quality via a t-norm Lukasiewicz, and retains crisp executability checks via pullback verification. FCP grounds graded applicability from language using an LLM with k-sample median aggregation and supports meeting-in-the-middle search using residuum-based backward requirements. We evaluate on (i) public PDDL3 preference/oversubscription benchmarks and (ii) RecipeNLG-Subs, a missing-substitute recipe-planning benchmark built from RecipeNLG with substitution candidates from Recipe1MSubs and FoodKG.

Our framework integrates all data types that are used by UN IGME: household surveys, vital registration, and other pre-processed mortality rates. We demonstrate that our framework is applicable to any country using log-logistic and piecewise-exponential survival functions, and discuss findings for four example countries with diverse data profiles: Kenya, Brazil, Estonia, and Syrian Arab Republic.

Our hypothesis is that IA will serve as a force multiplier for sellers, thereby driving incremental seller adoption by reducing the effort required and increase speed at which sellers make good business decisions. In this paper, we introduce this novel LLM-backed end-to-end agentic system built on a plan-and-execute paradigm and designed for comprehensive coverage, high accuracy, and low latency. It features a hierarchical multi-agent structure, consisting of manager agent and two worker agents: data presentation and insight generation, for efficient information retrieval and problem-solving. We design a simple yet effective ML solution for manager agent that combines Out-of-Domain (OOD) detection using a lightweight encoder-decoder model and agent routing through a BERT-based classifier, optimizing both accuracy and latency.

Existing category-theoretic planners provide compositional structure and pullback-based hard-constraint verification, but treat applicability as crisp, forcing thresholding that collapses meaningful distinctions and cannot track quality degradation across multi-step plans. We propose Fuzzy Category-theoretic Planning (FCP), which annotates each action (morphism) with a degree in [0,1], composes plan quality via a t-norm Lukasiewicz, and retains crisp executability checks via pullback verification. FCP grounds graded applicability from language using an LLM with k-sample median aggregation and supports meeting-in-the-middle search using residuum-based backward requirements. We evaluate on (i) public PDDL3 preference/oversubscription benchmarks and (ii) RecipeNLG-Subs, a missing-substitute recipe-planning benchmark built from RecipeNLG with substitution candidates from Recipe1MSubs and FoodKG. FCP improves success and reduces hard-constraint violations on RecipeNLG-Subs compared to LLM-only and ReAct-style baselines, while remaining competitive with classical PDDL3 planners."}

We identify a structural pattern we call jurisdiction-siloed disclosure: information about data practices appearing in specific, actionable form only within regional compliance sections labeled \"California Residents\" or \"EU/UK Users,\" while general sections use vague or qualified language for the same practices.\n  Our audit of 123 major companies identifies 282 potential instances across 77 companies (62.6% of this purposive sample). A conservative estimate restricted to practice categories validated against OPP-115 human annotations finds 138 instances across 54 companies (44%); post-2018 categories central to our findings await independent validation. If users skip jurisdiction-labeled sections as information foraging theory predicts, users outside regulated jurisdictions would receive less specific information about practices affecting them--a transparency failure operating through document architecture rather than omission.\n  We propose universal substantive disclosure: practices affecting all users should appear in the main policy body, with regional sections containing only procedural rights information. This standard finds support in analogous disclosure regimes (securities, truth-in-lending, nutritional labeling) where material information must reach all affected parties. Regulators could operationalize this through the FTC's \"clear and conspicuous\" standard and GDPR transparency principles.\n  This work is hypothesis-generating: we establish that the structural pattern exists and ground the transparency concern in behavioral theory, but direct measurement of jurisdiction-specific section skipping remains the critical validation priority.

Our hypothesis is that IA will serve as a force multiplier for sellers, thereby driving incremental seller adoption by reducing the effort required and increase speed at which sellers make good business decisions. In this paper, we introduce this novel LLM-backed end-to-end agentic system built on a plan-and-execute paradigm and designed for comprehensive coverage, high accuracy, and low latency. It features a hierarchical multi-agent structure, consisting of manager agent and two worker agents: data presentation and insight generation, for efficient information retrieval and problem-solving. We design a simple yet effective ML solution for manager agent that combines Out-of-Domain (OOD) detection using a lightweight encoder-decoder model and agent routing through a BERT-based classifier, optimizing both accuracy and latency.

We examine schadenfreude on Facebook over a ten-year period across nine major news publishers in the United States, the United Kingdom, and India (one left-leaning, one right-leaning, and one centrist per country). Using a combination of human annotation and machine-learning classification, we identify posts describing misfortune and detect schadenfreude in nearly one million associated comments. We find that while sadness and anger dominate reactions to misfortune posts, laughter and amusement form a substantial and patterned minority. Schadenfreude is most frequent in moralized and political contexts, higher among right-leaning audiences, and more pronounced in India than in the United States or United Kingdom. Temporal and regression analyses further reveal that schadenfreude generally increases when groups are politically out of power, but these patterns differ across party lines. Together, our findings move beyond anecdotal accounts to map schadenfreude as a dynamic, context-dependent feature of digital discourse, revealing how it evolves over time and across ideological and cultural divides."}

Such human-AI collective knowledge ecosystems contain feedback loops with both benefits (e.g., faster growth, easier learning) and systemic risks (e.g., quality dilution, skill reduction, model collapse). To understand such phenomena, we propose a minimal, interpretable dynamical model of the co-evolution of archive size, archive quality, model (LLM) skill, aggregate human skill, and query volume. The model captures two content inflows (human, LLM) controlled by a gate on LLM-content admissions, two learning pathways for humans (archive study vs. LLM assistance), and two LLM-training modalities (corpus-driven scaling vs. learning from human feedback). Through numerical experiments, we identify different growth regimes (e.g., healthy growth, inverted flow, inverted learning, oscillations), and show how platform and policy levers (gate strictness, LLM training, human learning pathways) shift the system across regime boundaries. Two domain configurations (PubMed, GitHub and Copilot) illustrate contrasting steady states under different growth rates and moderation norms. We also fit the model to Wikipedia's knowledge flow during pre-ChatGPT and post-ChatGPT eras separately. We find a rise in LLM additions with a concurrent decline in human inflow, consistent with a regime identified by the model. Our model and analysis yield actionable insights for sustainable growth of human-AI collective knowledge on the Web."}

To achieve this, we introduce SEER (Self-Evolving Evaluator and Reprompter), a training framework that establishes a two-stage endogenous loop using only 300 samples from a compact proxy task, Visual Instruction Elaboration. First, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) activates the model's latent evaluation ability via curriculum learning, producing a high-fidelity endogenous reward signal. Second, Reinforcement Learning with Model-rewarded Thinking (RLMT) leverages this signal to optimize the generative reasoning policy. Experiments show that SEER consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in evaluation accuracy, reprompting efficiency, and generation quality, without sacrificing general multimodal capabilities."}

Using country-level indicators and public opinion data from 125 countries, we benchmark four state-of-the-art LLMs against Gallup World Poll 2021/22 data and statistical regressions. LLMs, particularly Claude, accurately capture public perceptions of others' willingness to contribute financially to climate action (MAE approximately 5 p.p.; r = .77), comparable to statistical models, though performance declines in less digitally connected, lower-GDP countries. Controlled tests show that LLMs capture the key psychological process - social projection with a systematic downward bias - and rely on structured reasoning rather than memorized values. Overall, LLMs provide a rapid tool for assessing perception gaps in climate action, serving as an alternative to costly surveys in resource-rich countries and as a complement in underrepresented populations."}

Benefiting from the strong capabilities of LLMs, recent research focus has shifted from simple context extension to the development of dedicated agentic memory systems. However, existing approaches typically rely on rigid retrieval granularity, accumulation-heavy maintenance strategies, and coarse-grained update mechanisms. These design choices create a persistent mismatch between stored information and task-specific reasoning demands, while leading to the unchecked accumulation of logical inconsistencies over time. To address these challenges, we propose Adaptive Memory via Multi-Agent Collaboration (AMA), a novel framework that leverages coordinated agents to manage memory across multiple granularities. AMA employs a hierarchical memory design that dynamically aligns retrieval granularity with task complexity. Specifically, the Constructor and Retriever jointly enable multi-granularity memory construction and adaptive query routing. The Judge verifies the relevance and consistency of retrieved content, triggering iterative retrieval when evidence is insufficient or invoking the Refresher upon detecting logical conflicts. The Refresher then enforces memory consistency by performing targeted updates or removing outdated entries. Extensive experiments on challenging long-context benchmarks show that AMA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines while reducing token consumption by approximately 80% compared to full-context methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in maintaining retrieval precision and long-term memory consistency."}

We introduce Policy of Thoughts (PoT), a framework that recasts reasoning as a within-instance online optimization process. PoT first generates diverse candidate solutions via an efficient exploration mechanism, then uses Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to update a transient LoRA adapter based on execution feedback. This closed-loop design enables dynamic, instance-specific refinement of the model's reasoning priors.

However, the decision leaves unresolved practical challenges. What is the current state of age verification legislation in the United States? How can \"adequate tailoring\" be interpreted in a way that is accessible to non-legal experts, particularly those in technical and engineering domains? What age verification approaches are used today, what infrastructures and standards support them, and what tradeoffs do they introduce? This paper addresses those questions by proposing an analytical model to interpret \"adequate tailoring\" from multiple perspectives with associated governmental goals and interests, and by applying that model to evaluate both current state laws and widely used verification methods. This paper's major contributions include: (1) we mapped the current U.S. age-verification legislative landscape; (2) we introduce an analytical model to analyze \"adequate tailoring\" for age verification and potential application to other online regulatory policies; and (3) we analyze the main technical approaches to age verification, highlighting the practical challenges and tradeoffs from a technical perspective.

Building an effective GUI agent model relies on two factors: (1) high-quality data and (2) effective training methods. To address these, we introduce a carefully engineered data-construction pipeline and a decoupled training paradigm. For data construction, we leverage rigorously curated open-source datasets and introduce a novel automated synthesis framework that integrates bottom-up autonomous exploration with top-down taxonomy-guided generation to create high-fidelity synthetic data. For training, to better leverage these data, we adopt a two-stage strategy: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to establish fundamental interaction syntax, followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to improve spatial grounding and sequential planning. To balance computational efficiency with agentic reasoning capacity, OmegaUse is built on a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) backbone. To evaluate cross-terminal capabilities in an offline setting, we introduce OS-Nav, a benchmark suite spanning multiple operating systems: ChiM-Nav, targeting Chinese Android mobile environments, and Ubu-Nav, focusing on routine desktop interactions on Ubuntu.

We find that AI use impairs conceptual understanding, code reading, and debugging abilities, without delivering significant efficiency gains on average. Participants who fully delegated coding tasks showed some productivity improvements, but at the cost of learning the library. We identify six distinct AI interaction patterns, three of which involve cognitive engagement and preserve learning outcomes even when participants receive AI assistance.

We identify this as a Cognitive Gap: the model lacks the understanding of how to enhance its own generation process. To bridge this gap, we propose Endogenous Reprompting, a mechanism that transforms the model's understanding from a passive encoding process into an explicit generative reasoning step by generating self-aligned descriptors during generation. To achieve this, we introduce SEER (Self-Evolving Evaluator and Reprompter), a training framework that establishes a two-stage endogenous loop using only 300 samples from a compact proxy task, Visual Instruction Elaboration. First, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) activates the model's latent evaluation ability via curriculum learning, producing a high-fidelity endogenous reward signal. Second, Reinforcement Learning with Model-rewarded Thinking (RLMT) leverages this signal to optimize the generative reasoning policy. Experiments show that SEER consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in evaluation accuracy, reprompting efficiency, and generation quality, without sacrificing general multimodal capabilities."}

Benefiting from the strong capabilities of LLMs, recent research focus has shifted from simple context extension to the development of dedicated agentic memory systems. However, existing approaches typically rely on rigid retrieval granularity, accumulation-heavy maintenance strategies, and coarse-grained update mechanisms. These design choices create a persistent mismatch between stored information and task-specific reasoning demands, while leading to the unchecked accumulation of logical inconsistencies over time. To address these challenges, we propose Adaptive Memory via Multi-Agent Collaboration (AMA), a novel framework that leverages coordinated agents to manage memory across multiple granularities. AMA employs a hierarchical memory design that dynamically aligns retrieval granularity with task complexity. Specifically, the Constructor and Retriever jointly enable multi-granularity memory construction and adaptive query routing. The Judge verifies the relevance and consistency of retrieved content, triggering iterative retrieval when evidence is insufficient or invoking the Refresher upon detecting logical conflicts. The Refresher then enforces memory consistency by performing targeted updates or removing outdated entries. Extensive experiments on challenging long-context benchmarks show that AMA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines while reducing token consumption by approximately 80% compared to full-context methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in maintaining retrieval precision and long-term memory consistency."}

We introduce Policy of Thoughts (PoT), a framework that recasts reasoning as a within-instance online optimization process. PoT first generates diverse candidate solutions via an efficient exploration mechanism, then uses Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to update a transient LoRA adapter based on execution feedback. This closed-loop design enables dynamic, instance-specific refinement of the model's reasoning priors.

Using Claude, Gemini, and GPT-4o, we conducted 72 dialogue turns totaling 576,822 characters of structured exchange.\n  Results demonstrate that AI systems can engage meaningfully with Peace Studies concepts, surface complementary objections from different architectural perspectives, and generate emergent insights not present in initial framings - including the novel synthesis of \"VCW as transitional framework.\" Cross-architecture patterns reveal that different models foreground different concerns: Claude emphasized verification challenges, Gemini focused on bias and scalability, and GPT-4o highlighted implementation barriers.\n  The framework provides researchers with replicable methods for stress-testing alignment proposals before implementation, while the findings offer preliminary evidence about AI capacity for the kind of dialogical reasoning VCW proposes. We discuss limitations, including the observation that dialogues engaged more with process elements than with foundational claims about AI nature, and outline directions for future research including human-AI hybrid protocols and extended dialogue studies."}

In this report, we present OmegaUse, a general-purpose GUI agent model for autonomous task execution on both mobile and desktop platforms, supporting computer-use and phone-use scenarios. Building an effective GUI agent model relies on two factors: (1) high-quality data and (2) effective training methods. To address these, we introduce a carefully engineered data-construction pipeline and a decoupled training paradigm. For data construction, we leverage rigorously curated open-source datasets and introduce a novel automated synthesis framework that integrates bottom-up autonomous exploration with top-down taxonomy-guided generation to create high-fidelity synthetic data. For training, to better leverage these data, we adopt a two-stage strategy: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to establish fundamental interaction syntax, followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to improve spatial grounding and sequential planning. To balance computational efficiency with agentic reasoning capacity, OmegaUse is built on a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) backbone. To evaluate cross-terminal capabilities in an offline setting, we introduce OS-Nav, a benchmark suite spanning multiple operating systems: ChiM-Nav, targeting Chinese Android mobile environments, and Ubu-Nav, focusing on routine desktop interactions on Ubuntu. Extensive experiments show that OmegaUse is highly competitive across established GUI benchmarks, achieving a state-of-the-art (SOTA) score of 96.3% on ScreenSpot-V2 and a leading 79.1% step success rate on AndroidControl.

However, we identify a systematic lack of emphasis on more challenging questions in existing methods from both algorithmic and data perspectives, despite their importance for refining underdeveloped capabilities. Algorithmically, widely used Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) suffers from an implicit imbalance where the magnitude of policy updates is lower for harder questions. Data-wise, augmentation approaches primarily rephrase questions to enhance diversity without systematically increasing intrinsic difficulty. To address these issues, we propose a two-dual MathForge framework to improve mathematical reasoning by targeting harder questions from both perspectives, which comprises a Difficulty-Aware Group Policy Optimization (DGPO) algorithm and a Multi-Aspect Question Reformulation (MQR) strategy. Specifically, DGPO first rectifies the implicit imbalance in GRPO via difficulty-balanced group advantage estimation, and further prioritizes harder questions by difficulty-aware question-level weighting. Meanwhile, MQR reformulates questions across multiple aspects to increase difficulty while maintaining the original gold answer. Overall, MathForge forms a synergistic loop: MQR expands the data frontier, and DGPO effectively learns from the augmented data. Extensive experiments show that MathForge significantly outperforms existing methods on various mathematical reasoning tasks.

Using a combination of human annotation and machine-learning classification, we identify posts describing misfortune and detect schadenfreude in nearly one million associated comments. We find that while sadness and anger dominate reactions to misfortune posts, laughter and amusement form a substantial and patterned minority. Schadenfreude is most frequent in moralized and political contexts, higher among right-leaning audiences, and more pronounced in India than in the United States or United Kingdom. Temporal and regression analyses further reveal that schadenfreude generally increases when groups are politically out of power, but these patterns differ across party lines.

To investigate these aspects, we use a referential-game framework in which vision-language model (VLM) agents communicate, providing a controlled, measurable setting for evaluating language variants. Experiments show that VLMs can develop effective, task-adapted communication patterns. At the same time, they can develop covert protocols that are difficult for humans and external agents to interpret. We also observe spontaneous coordination between similar models without explicitly shared protocols. These findings highlight both the potential and the risks of task-oriented communication, and position referential games as a valuable testbed for future work in this area."}

Although this compositional paradigm has shown superior performance in domains such as reasoning, planning, and verification, its deployment remains challenging due to severe inefficiencies in symbolic and probabilistic inference. Through systematic analysis of representative neuro-symbolic workloads, we identify probabilistic logical reasoning as the inefficiency bottleneck, characterized by irregular control flow, low arithmetic intensity, uncoalesced memory accesses, and poor hardware utilization on CPUs and GPUs.\n  This paper presents REASON, an integrated acceleration framework for probabilistic logical reasoning in neuro-symbolic AI. REASON introduces a unified directed acyclic graph representation that captures common structure across symbolic and probabilistic models, coupled with adaptive pruning and regularization. At the architecture level, REASON features a reconfigurable, tree-based processing fabric optimized for irregular traversal, symbolic deduction, and probabilistic aggregation. At the system level, REASON is tightly integrated with GPU streaming multiprocessors through a programmable interface and multi-level pipeline that efficiently orchestrates compositional execution. Evaluated across six neuro-symbolic workloads, REASON achieves 12-50x speedup and 310-681x energy efficiency over desktop and edge GPUs under TSMC 28 nm node. REASON enables real-time probabilistic logical reasoning, completing end-to-end tasks in 0.8 s with 6 mm2 area and 2.12 W power, demonstrating that targeted acceleration of probabilistic logical reasoning is critical for practical and scalable neuro-symbolic AI and positioning REASON as a foundational system architecture for next-generation cognitive intelligence."}

Drawing on Peace Studies traditions - particularly interest-based negotiation, conflict transformation, and commons governance - we operationalize Viral Collaborative Wisdom (VCW), an approach that reframes alignment from a control problem to a relationship problem developed through dialogical reasoning.\n  Our experimental design assigns four distinct roles (Proposer, Responder, Monitor, Translator) to different AI systems across six conditions, testing whether current large language models can engage substantively with complex alignment frameworks. Using Claude, Gemini, and GPT-4o, we conducted 72 dialogue turns totaling 576,822 characters of structured exchange.\n  Results demonstrate that AI systems can engage meaningfully with Peace Studies concepts, surface complementary objections from different architectural perspectives, and generate emergent insights not present in initial framings - including the novel synthesis of \"VCW as transitional framework.\" Cross-architecture patterns reveal that different models foreground different concerns: Claude emphasized verification challenges, Gemini focused on bias and scalability, and GPT-4o highlighted implementation barriers.\n  The framework provides researchers with replicable methods for stress-testing alignment proposals before implementation, while the findings offer preliminary evidence about AI capacity for the kind of dialogical reasoning VCW proposes. We discuss limitations, including the observation that dialogues engaged more with process elements than with foundational claims about AI nature, and outline directions for future research including human-AI hybrid protocols and extended dialogue studies."}

However, we identify a systematic lack of emphasis on more challenging questions in existing methods from both algorithmic and data perspectives, despite their importance for refining underdeveloped capabilities. Algorithmically, widely used Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) suffers from an implicit imbalance where the magnitude of policy updates is lower for harder questions. Data-wise, augmentation approaches primarily rephrase questions to enhance diversity without systematically increasing intrinsic difficulty. To address these issues, we propose a two-dual MathForge framework to improve mathematical reasoning by targeting harder questions from both perspectives, which comprises a Difficulty-Aware Group Policy Optimization (DGPO) algorithm and a Multi-Aspect Question Reformulation (MQR) strategy. Specifically, DGPO first rectifies the implicit imbalance in GRPO via difficulty-balanced group advantage estimation, and further prioritizes harder questions by difficulty-aware question-level weighting. Meanwhile, MQR reformulates questions across multiple aspects to increase difficulty while maintaining the original gold answer. Overall, MathForge forms a synergistic loop: MQR expands the data frontier, and DGPO effectively learns from the augmented data. Extensive experiments show that MathForge significantly outperforms existing methods on various mathematical reasoning tasks. The code and augmented data are all available at https://github.com/AMAP-ML/MathForge."}

Such human-AI collective knowledge ecosystems contain feedback loops with both benefits (e.g., faster growth, easier learning) and systemic risks (e.g., quality dilution, skill reduction, model collapse). To understand such phenomena, we propose a minimal, interpretable dynamical model of the co-evolution of archive size, archive quality, model (LLM) skill, aggregate human skill, and query volume. The model captures two content inflows (human, LLM) controlled by a gate on LLM-content admissions, two learning pathways for humans (archive study vs. LLM assistance), and two LLM-training modalities (corpus-driven scaling vs. learning from human feedback). Through numerical experiments, we identify different growth regimes (e.g., healthy growth, inverted flow, inverted learning, oscillations), and show how platform and policy levers (gate strictness, LLM training, human learning pathways) shift the system across regime boundaries. Two domain configurations (PubMed, GitHub and Copilot) illustrate contrasting steady states under different growth rates and moderation norms. We also fit the model to Wikipedia's knowledge flow during pre-ChatGPT and post-ChatGPT eras separately. We find a rise in LLM additions with a concurrent decline in human inflow, consistent with a regime identified by the model. Our model and analysis yield actionable insights for sustainable growth of human-AI collective knowledge on the Web."}

Our focus is on two core properties such task-oriented protocols may exhibit: Efficiency -- conveying task-relevant information more concisely than natural language, and Covertness -- becoming difficult for external observers to interpret, raising concerns about transparency and control. To investigate these aspects, we use a referential-game framework in which vision-language model (VLM) agents communicate, providing a controlled, measurable setting for evaluating language variants. Experiments show that VLMs can develop effective, task-adapted communication patterns. At the same time, they can develop covert protocols that are difficult for humans and external agents to interpret. We also observe spontaneous coordination between similar models without explicitly shared protocols. These findings highlight both the potential and the risks of task-oriented communication, and position referential games as a valuable testbed for future work in this area."}

In this preregistered experiment, we test whether large language models (LLMs) can reliably predict these perception gaps worldwide. Using country-level indicators and public opinion data from 125 countries, we benchmark four state-of-the-art LLMs against Gallup World Poll 2021/22 data and statistical regressions. LLMs, particularly Claude, accurately capture public perceptions of others' willingness to contribute financially to climate action (MAE approximately 5 p.p.; r = .77), comparable to statistical models, though performance declines in less digitally connected, lower-GDP countries. Controlled tests show that LLMs capture the key psychological process - social projection with a systematic downward bias - and rely on structured reasoning rather than memorized values. Overall, LLMs provide a rapid tool for assessing perception gaps in climate action, serving as an alternative to costly surveys in resource-rich countries and as a complement in underrepresented populations."}

However, large-scale networks present unique challenges: they contain hundreds of thousands of nodes and edges with heterogeneous and overlapping community structures that evolve over time. Existing approaches face notable limitations: traditional graph neural networks struggle to capture global structural dependencies, while recent graph transformers achieve strong performance but incur quadratic complexity and lack interpretable latent structure. We propose \\textbf{TGSBM} (Transformer-Guided Stochastic Block Model), a framework that integrates the principled generative structure of Overlapping Stochastic Block Models with the representational power of sparse Graph Transformers. TGSBM comprises three main components: (i) \\emph{expander-augmented sparse attention} that enables near-linear complexity and efficient global mixing, (ii) a \\emph{neural variational encoder} that infers structured posteriors over community memberships and strengths, and (iii) a \\emph{neural edge decoder} that reconstructs links via OSBM's generative process, preserving interpretability. Experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate competitive performance (mean rank 1.6 under HeaRT protocol), superior scalability (up to $6\\times$ faster training), and interpretable community structures. These results position TGSBM as a practical approach that strikes a balance between accuracy, efficiency, and transparency for large-scale link prediction."}

Novice workers who rely heavily on AI to complete unfamiliar tasks may compromise their own skill acquisition in the process. We conduct randomized experiments to study how developers gained mastery of a new asynchronous programming library with and without the assistance of AI. We find that AI use impairs conceptual understanding, code reading, and debugging abilities, without delivering significant efficiency gains on average. Participants who fully delegated coding tasks showed some productivity improvements, but at the cost of learning the library. We identify six distinct AI interaction patterns, three of which involve cognitive engagement and preserve learning outcomes even when participants receive AI assistance. Our findings suggest that AI-enhanced productivity is not a shortcut to competence and AI assistance should be carefully adopted into workflows to preserve skill formation -- particularly in safety-critical domains."}

Although this compositional paradigm has shown superior performance in domains such as reasoning, planning, and verification, its deployment remains challenging due to severe inefficiencies in symbolic and probabilistic inference. Through systematic analysis of representative neuro-symbolic workloads, we identify probabilistic logical reasoning as the inefficiency bottleneck, characterized by irregular control flow, low arithmetic intensity, uncoalesced memory accesses, and poor hardware utilization on CPUs and GPUs.\n  This paper presents REASON, an integrated acceleration framework for probabilistic logical reasoning in neuro-symbolic AI. REASON introduces a unified directed acyclic graph representation that captures common structure across symbolic and probabilistic models, coupled with adaptive pruning and regularization. At the architecture level, REASON features a reconfigurable, tree-based processing fabric optimized for irregular traversal, symbolic deduction, and probabilistic aggregation. At the system level, REASON is tightly integrated with GPU streaming multiprocessors through a programmable interface and multi-level pipeline that efficiently orchestrates compositional execution. Evaluated across six neuro-symbolic workloads, REASON achieves 12-50x speedup and 310-681x energy efficiency over desktop and edge GPUs under TSMC 28 nm node. REASON enables real-time probabilistic logical reasoning, completing end-to-end tasks in 0.8 s with 6 mm2 area and 2.12 W power, demonstrating that targeted acceleration of probabilistic logical reasoning is critical for practical and scalable neuro-symbolic AI and positioning REASON as a foundational system architecture for next-generation cognitive intelligence."}

A conservative estimate restricted to practice categories validated against OPP-115 human annotations finds 138 instances across 54 companies (44%); post-2018 categories central to our findings await independent validation. If users skip jurisdiction-labeled sections as information foraging theory predicts, users outside regulated jurisdictions would receive less specific information about practices affecting them--a transparency failure operating through document architecture rather than omission.\n  We propose universal substantive disclosure: practices affecting all users should appear in the main policy body, with regional sections containing only procedural rights information.
