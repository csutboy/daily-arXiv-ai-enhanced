### [1] [KRED: Korea Research Economic Database for Macroeconomic Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16115)
*Changryong Baek,Seunghyun Moon,Seunghyeon Lee*

Main category: econ.EM

TL;DR: KRED是一个新的韩国宏观经济数据集，采用FRED MD格式，包含88个月度时间序列，通过PCA提取四个主成分因子来捕捉韩国经济波动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建标准化的韩国宏观经济数据库，便于与FRED MD直接比较，并开发能够有效总结韩国经济波动的扩散指数。

Method: 整合88个关键月度时间序列，使用主成分分析(PCA)从80个平衡面板序列(2009-2024)中提取四个主成分因子。

Result: 四个因子解释了约40%的总方差，分别代表货币状况、劳动力市场活动、实际产出和住房需求，能够清晰追踪COVID-19衰退等重大经济波动。

Conclusion: KRED的因子结构能够有效将复杂经济信息浓缩为少数信息丰富的指数，为研究韩国商业周期和协同运动提供新见解。

Abstract: We introduce KRED (Korea Research Economic Database), a new FRED MD style
macroeconomic dataset for South Korea. KRED is constructed by aggregating 88
key monthly time series from multiple official sources (e.g., Bank of Korea
ECOS, Statistics Korea KOSIS) into a unified, publicly available database. The
dataset is aligned with the FRED MD format, enabling standardized
transformations and direct comparability; an Appendix maps each Korean series
to its FRED MD counterpart. Using a balanced panel of 80 series from 2009 to
2024, we extract four principal components via PCA that explain approximately
40% of the total variance. These four factors have intuitive economic
interpretations, capturing monetary conditions, labor market activity, real
output, and housing demand, analogous to diffusion indexes summarizing broad
economic movements. Notably, the factor based diffusion indexes derived from
KRED clearly trace major macroeconomic fluctuations over the sample period such
as the 2020 COVID 19 recession. Our results demonstrate that KRED's factor
structure can effectively condense complex economic information into a few
informative indexes, yielding new insights into South Korea's business cycles
and co movements.

### [2] [Efficient and Accessible Discrete Choice Experiments: The DCEtool Package for R](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15326)
*Daniel Pérez-Troncoso*

Main category: econ.EM

TL;DR: DCEtool是一个R包，提供基于Shiny的图形界面，帮助研究人员构建、解码和分析统计高效的离散选择实验设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的商业工具虽然实现了统计高效的设计方法，但研究人员在寻找免费和易用的解决方案时面临限制。

Method: 开发了一个R包DCEtool，具有Shiny图形界面，支持序列DCE实施，提供灵活的设计设置，并能快速估计离散选择模型。

Result: DCEtool使先进的设计技术更易获取，有助于在选择建模中更广泛地采用严格的实验实践。

Conclusion: DCEtool为新手和有经验的用户提供了构建统计高效DCE设计的可访问解决方案，促进了选择建模方法的普及。

Abstract: Discrete Choice Experiments (DCEs) are widely used to elicit preferences for
products or services by analyzing choices among alternatives described by their
attributes. The quality of the insights obtained from a DCE heavily depends on
the properties of its experimental design. While early DCEs often relied on
linear criteria such as orthogonality, these approaches were later found to be
inappropriate for discrete choice models, which are inherently non-linear. As a
result, statistically efficient design methods, based on minimizing the D-error
to reduce parameter variance, have become the standard. Although such methods
are implemented in several commercial tools, researchers seeking free and
accessible solutions often face limitations. This paper presents DCEtool, an R
package with a Shiny-based graphical interface designed to support both novice
and experienced users in constructing, decoding, and analyzing statistically
efficient DCE designs. DCEtool facilitates the implementation of serial DCEs,
offers flexible design settings, and enables rapid estimation of discrete
choice models. By making advanced design techniques more accessible, DCEtool
contributes to the broader adoption of rigorous experimental practices in
choice modelling.

### [3] [Inference on the Distribution of Individual Treatment Effects in Nonseparable Triangular Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15401)
*Jun Ma,Vadim Marmer,Zhengfei Yu*

Main category: econ.EM

TL;DR: 本文开发了非可分离三角模型中异质性个体处理效应分布的非参数推断方法，重点关注ITE累积分布函数的估计，建立了经验CDF和分位函数的弱收敛性，并提出了基于bootstrap的推断方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文献主要关注密度估计方法，但CDF方法可以解决更广泛的实践问题（如正效应个体比例、分位数、跨子群体比较等），且能提供更精确的结果。

Method: 使用Feng, Vuong, and Xu (2019)的非参数ITE估计计算经验CDF和分位函数，建立其弱收敛到紧高斯过程的理论基础，开发基于bootstrap的非参数推断方法。

Result: 成功建立了经验CDF和分位函数的弱收敛理论，并构建了统一的置信带，为ITE分布提供了可靠的统计推断工具。

Conclusion: 提出的CDF方法比密度方法更具优势，能够有效解决异质性处理效应分布推断中的多种实际问题，为非可分离三角模型提供了实用的统计工具。

Abstract: In this paper, we develop inference methods for the distribution of
heterogeneous individual treatment effects (ITEs) in the nonseparable
triangular model with a binary endogenous treatment and a binary instrument of
Vuong and Xu (2017) and Feng, Vuong, and Xu (2019). We focus on the estimation
of the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the ITE, which can be used to
address a wide range of practically important questions such as inference on
the proportion of individuals with positive ITEs, the quantiles of the
distribution of ITEs, and the interquartile range as a measure of the spread of
the ITEs, as well as comparison of the ITE distributions across
sub-populations. Moreover, our CDF-based approach can deliver more precise
results than density-based approach previously considered in the literature. We
establish weak convergence to tight Gaussian processes for the empirical CDF
and quantile function computed from nonparametric ITE estimates of Feng, Vuong,
and Xu (2019). Using those results, we develop bootstrap-based nonparametric
inferential methods, including uniform confidence bands for the CDF and
quantile function of the ITE distribution.

### [4] [DIPP: Discriminative Impact Point Predictor for Catching Diverse In-Flight Objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15254)
*Ngoc Huy Nguyen,Kazuki Shibata,Takamitsu Matsubara*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种用于四足机器人空中抓取物体的方法，通过构建包含8000条轨迹的真实数据集，并开发了判别性落点预测器（DIPP）来准确预测物体的落点位置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决空中物体抓取中的两个关键挑战：缺乏包含不稳定空气动力学下多样化物体的公开数据集，以及在轨迹相似时难以进行早期阶段准确落点预测。

Method: 构建了包含20个物体8000条轨迹的真实数据集；提出了判别性落点预测器（DIPP），包含判别性特征嵌入（DFE）模块和落点预测器（IPP）模块，其中IPP有两种变体：基于神经加速度估计器（NAE）的方法和基于直接点估计器（DPE）的方法。

Result: 实验结果表明，所构建的数据集比现有数据集更加多样化和复杂；所提方法在15个已知物体和5个未知物体上都优于基线方法；改进的早期预测提高了模拟中的抓取成功率，并通过真实世界实验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究成功解决了空中物体抓取的挑战，通过构建高质量数据集和创新的预测方法，实现了对复杂空气动力学下物体轨迹的准确预测，为机器人空中抓取任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In this study, we address the problem of in-flight object catching using a
quadruped robot with a basket. Our objective is to accurately predict the
impact point, defined as the object's landing position. This task poses two key
challenges: the absence of public datasets capturing diverse objects under
unsteady aerodynamics, which are essential for training reliable predictors;
and the difficulty of accurate early-stage impact point prediction when
trajectories appear similar across objects. To overcome these issues, we
construct a real-world dataset of 8,000 trajectories from 20 objects, providing
a foundation for advancing in-flight object catching under complex
aerodynamics. We then propose the Discriminative Impact Point Predictor (DIPP),
consisting of two modules: (i) a Discriminative Feature Embedding (DFE) that
separates trajectories by dynamics to enable early-stage discrimination and
generalization, and (ii) an Impact Point Predictor (IPP) that estimates the
impact point from these features. Two IPP variants are implemented: an Neural
Acceleration Estimator (NAE)-based method that predicts trajectories and
derives the impact point, and a Direct Point Estimator (DPE)-based method that
directly outputs it. Experimental results show that our dataset is more diverse
and complex than existing dataset, and that our method outperforms baselines on
both 15 seen and 5 unseen objects. Furthermore, we show that improved
early-stage prediction enhances catching success in simulation and demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach through real-world experiments. The
demonstration is available at

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文介绍了GiAnt的设计、开发和测试，这是一款受蚂蚁高效运动启发的经济型六足机器人，具有出色的地形适应性和能源效率，适用于户外应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 灵感来源于蚂蚁在各种地形上的自然适应性，旨在开发一款能够在复杂地形（如草地、岩石和陡坡）上灵活移动的六足机器人，克服传统轮式机器人的局限性。

Method: 采用3D打印和激光切割的轻量化结构（重1.75 kg），腿部设计为单自由度连杆曲柄机构，基于Arduino的控制系统，通过步态分析实现有效控制，并集成机器学习和图像处理技术进行物体识别。

Conclusion: GiAnt代表了在研发、探索和勘测领域创建可访问六足机器人的重要进展，其在适应性和控制简单性方面具有独特优势。

Abstract: This paper presents the design, development and testing of GiAnt, an
affordable hexapod which is inspired by the efficient motions of ants. The
decision to model GiAnt after ants rather than other insects is rooted in ants'
natural adaptability to a variety of terrains. This bio-inspired approach gives
it a significant advantage in outdoor applications, offering terrain
flexibility along with efficient energy use. It features a lightweight
3D-printed and laser cut structure weighing 1.75 kg with dimensions of 310 mm x
200 mm x 120 mm. Its legs have been designed with a simple Single Degree of
Freedom (DOF) using a link and crank mechanism. It is great for conquering
challenging terrains such as grass, rocks, and steep surfaces. Unlike
traditional robots using four wheels for motion, its legged design gives
superior adaptability to uneven and rough surfaces. GiAnt's control system is
built on Arduino, allowing manual operation. An effective way of controlling
the legs of GiAnt was achieved by gait analysis. It can move up to 8 cm of
height easily with its advanced leg positioning system. Furthermore, equipped
with machine learning and image processing technology, it can identify 81
different objects in a live monitoring system. It represents a significant step
towards creating accessible hexapod robots for research, exploration, and
surveying, offering unique advantages in adaptability and control simplicity.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Embodied Arena是一个全面的、统一的、不断发展的Embodied AI评估平台，旨在解决该领域的三个关键挑战：缺乏系统化的能力理解、缺少统一评估系统、以及数据获取方法不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Embodied AI发展显著落后于大型基础模型，主要面临三个关键挑战：(1)缺乏对Embodied AI核心能力的系统理解，(2)缺少统一标准化的评估系统，(3)自动化可扩展的具身数据获取方法不成熟。

Method: 建立系统化的具身能力分类法（3个层次、7个核心能力、25个细粒度维度），构建标准化评估系统支持22个多样化基准测试，开发基于LLM的自动化生成管道确保可扩展的评估数据。

Conclusion: Embodied Arena平台通过系统化的评估框架和标准化基础设施，为Embodied AI领域提供了明确的研究目标和评估标准，有望推动该领域的进步。

Abstract: Embodied AI development significantly lags behind large foundation models due
to three critical challenges: (1) lack of systematic understanding of core
capabilities needed for Embodied AI, making research lack clear objectives; (2)
absence of unified and standardized evaluation systems, rendering
cross-benchmark evaluation infeasible; and (3) underdeveloped automated and
scalable acquisition methods for embodied data, creating critical bottlenecks
for model scaling. To address these obstacles, we present Embodied Arena, a
comprehensive, unified, and evolving evaluation platform for Embodied AI. Our
platform establishes a systematic embodied capability taxonomy spanning three
levels (perception, reasoning, task execution), seven core capabilities, and 25
fine-grained dimensions, enabling unified evaluation with systematic research
objectives. We introduce a standardized evaluation system built upon unified
infrastructure supporting flexible integration of 22 diverse benchmarks across
three domains (2D/3D Embodied Q&A, Navigation, Task Planning) and 30+ advanced
models from 20+ worldwide institutes. Additionally, we develop a novel
LLM-driven automated generation pipeline ensuring scalable embodied evaluation
data with continuous evolution for diversity and comprehensiveness. Embodied
Arena publishes three real-time leaderboards (Embodied Q&A, Navigation, Task
Planning) with dual perspectives (benchmark view and capability view),
providing comprehensive overviews of advanced model capabilities. Especially,
we present nine findings summarized from the evaluation results on the
leaderboards of Embodied Arena. This helps to establish clear research veins
and pinpoint critical research problems, thereby driving forward progress in
the field of Embodied AI.

### [7] [Measurement and Potential Field-Based Patient Modeling for Model-Mediated Tele-ultrasound](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15325)
*Ryan S. Yeung,David G. Black,Septimiu E. Salcudean*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种改进的模型介导远程超声方法，通过整合测量力来更新内部势场模型，提高力反馈的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 远程超声操作可以改善偏远社区的医疗影像诊断可及性。准确的力量反馈对于超声医师施加适当的探头接触力以优化图像质量至关重要，但通信延迟使得直接力反馈不实用。

Method: 首先生成患者表面的点云模型，转换为静态体素化体积，每个体素包含势场值。使用凸二次规划结合空间拉普拉斯算子和测量力来求解势场，基于体素化体积与超声换能器点壳模型的重叠来渲染力和扭矩。

Result: 在志愿者患者（n=3）上的评估显示，与仅使用拉普拉斯方程相比，在模型中添加测量力使力大小误差平均减少7.23N，力向量角度误差平均减少9.37°。

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过整合测量力更新内部势场模型，显著提高了远程超声操作中力反馈的准确性，为远程医疗超声检查提供了更透明的模型介导解决方案。

Abstract: Teleoperated ultrasound can improve diagnostic medical imaging access for
remote communities. Having accurate force feedback is important for enabling
sonographers to apply the appropriate probe contact force to optimize
ultrasound image quality. However, large time delays in communication make
direct force feedback impractical. Prior work investigated using point
cloud-based model-mediated teleoperation and internal potential field models to
estimate contact forces and torques. We expand on this by introducing a method
to update the internal potential field model of the patient with measured
positions and forces for more transparent model-mediated tele-ultrasound. We
first generate a point cloud model of the patient's surface and transmit this
to the sonographer in a compact data structure. This is converted to a static
voxelized volume where each voxel contains a potential field value. These
values determine the forces and torques, which are rendered based on overlap
between the voxelized volume and a point shell model of the ultrasound
transducer. We solve for the potential field using a convex quadratic that
combines the spatial Laplace operator with measured forces. This was evaluated
on volunteer patients ($n=3$) by computing the accuracy of rendered forces.
Results showed the addition of measured forces to the model reduced the force
magnitude error by an average of 7.23 N and force vector angle error by an
average of 9.37$^{\circ}$ compared to using only Laplace's equation.

### [8] [Trust-Aware Embodied Bayesian Persuasion for Mixed-Autonomy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15404)
*Shaoting Peng,Katherine Driggs-Campbell,Roy Dong*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了TA-EBP框架，通过贝叶斯劝说和信任建模解决自动驾驶车辆与人类驾驶车辆交互中的信任衰减和安全问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统博弈论模型在自动驾驶车辆与人类驾驶车辆交互中存在长期影响力衰减问题，可能被视为操纵性行为，侵蚀人类信任，反而导致更危险的人类驾驶行为

Method: 提出信任感知的具身贝叶斯劝说框架：1）应用贝叶斯劝说建模交通路口通信；2）引入信任参数并推导最小信任水平定理；3）将抽象信号映射到连续物理动作空间，推导最优信号幅度定理（表现为车辆前推动作）

Result: 在混合自主交通仿真中验证，TA-EBP成功说服人类驾驶车辆更谨慎驾驶，消除碰撞并改善交通流量，优于忽略信任或缺乏通信的基线方法

Conclusion: 该工作为人类-机器人交互提供了一个透明且非战略性的影响力框架，同时提高了安全性和效率

Abstract: Safe and efficient interaction between autonomous vehicles (AVs) and
human-driven vehicles (HVs) is a critical challenge for future transportation
systems. While game-theoretic models capture how AVs influence HVs, they often
suffer from a long-term decay of influence and can be perceived as
manipulative, eroding the human's trust. This can paradoxically lead to riskier
human driving behavior over repeated interactions. In this paper, we address
this challenge by proposing the Trust-Aware Embodied Bayesian Persuasion
(TA-EBP) framework. Our work makes three key contributions: First, we apply
Bayesian persuasion to model communication at traffic intersections, offering a
transparent alternative to traditional game-theoretic models. Second, we
introduce a trust parameter to the persuasion framework, deriving a theorem for
the minimum trust level required for influence. Finally, we ground the abstract
signals of Bayesian persuasion theory into a continuous, physically meaningful
action space, deriving a second theorem for the optimal signal magnitude,
realized as an AV's forward nudge. Additionally, we validate our framework in a
mixed-autonomy traffic simulation, demonstrating that TA-EBP successfully
persuades HVs to drive more cautiously, eliminating collisions and improving
traffic flow compared to baselines that either ignore trust or lack
communication. Our work provides a transparent and non-strategic framework for
influence in human-robot interaction, enhancing both safety and efficiency.

*Easop Lee,Samuel A. Moore,Boyuan Chen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Sym2Real是一个数据驱动框架，通过符号回归和残差学习实现高效数据利用，仅需约10条轨迹即可在真实世界中实现四旋翼和赛车的鲁棒控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法需要大量专家知识或仿真调参，而Sym2Real旨在解决符号回归在真实机器人应用中的噪声敏感性和模型退化问题，实现数据高效的自适应控制。

Method: 结合低精度仿真数据和目标导向的真实世界残差学习，利用系统物理特性共享的特点，通过符号回归提取物理规律。

Result: 在6个分布外仿真场景和5个真实世界条件下均实现成功迁移，验证了框架的数据效率和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Sym2Real为低层自适应控制提供了一种原则性的数据驱动方法，无需专家知识或大量仿真调参即可实现真实世界的鲁棒控制。

Abstract: We present Sym2Real, a fully data-driven framework that provides a principled
way to train low-level adaptive controllers in a highly data-efficient manner.
Using only about 10 trajectories, we achieve robust control of both a quadrotor
and a racecar in the real world, without expert knowledge or simulation tuning.
Our approach achieves this data efficiency by bringing symbolic regression to
real-world robotics while addressing key challenges that prevent its direct
application, including noise sensitivity and model degradation that lead to
unsafe control. Our key observation is that the underlying physics is often
shared for a system regardless of internal or external changes. Hence, we
strategically combine low-fidelity simulation data with targeted real-world
residual learning. Through experimental validation on quadrotor and racecar
platforms, we demonstrate consistent data-efficient adaptation across six
out-of-distribution sim2sim scenarios and successful sim2real transfer across
five real-world conditions. More information and videos can be found at at

### [10] [Online Slip Detection and Friction Coefficient Estimation for Autonomous Racing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15423)
*Christopher Oeltjen,Carson Sobolewski,Saleh Faghfoorian,Lorant Domokos,Giancarlo Vidal,Ivan Ruchkin*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于IMU和LiDAR测量的轻量级在线滑移检测和轮胎-路面摩擦系数估计方法，无需复杂的车辆模型或训练数据


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 轮胎-路面摩擦系数的准确估计对车辆安全至关重要，特别是在极限工况下的自动驾驶赛车中。现有方法依赖不确定参数的模型或需要大量训练数据

Method: 仅使用IMU和LiDAR测量数据以及控制指令，通过比较指令运动与实际运动来实时检测滑移事件，在无滑移条件下直接从观测加速度估计摩擦系数

Result: 在1:10比例自动驾驶赛车上的实验表明，该方法在不同摩擦水平下都能实现准确一致的滑移检测和摩擦系数估计，结果与地面真实测量高度匹配

Conclusion: 该方法简单、可部署且计算高效，在自动驾驶实时滑移监测和摩擦系数估计方面具有巨大潜力

Abstract: Accurate knowledge of the tire-road friction coefficient (TRFC) is essential
for vehicle safety, stability, and performance, especially in autonomous
racing, where vehicles often operate at the friction limit. However, TRFC
cannot be directly measured with standard sensors, and existing estimation
methods either depend on vehicle or tire models with uncertain parameters or
require large training datasets. In this paper, we present a lightweight
approach for online slip detection and TRFC estimation. Our approach relies
solely on IMU and LiDAR measurements and the control actions, without special
dynamical or tire models, parameter identification, or training data. Slip
events are detected in real time by comparing commanded and measured motions,
and the TRFC is then estimated directly from observed accelerations under
no-slip conditions. Experiments with a 1:10-scale autonomous racing car across
different friction levels demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves
accurate and consistent slip detections and friction coefficients, with results
closely matching ground-truth measurements. These findings highlight the
potential of our simple, deployable, and computationally efficient approach for
real-time slip monitoring and friction coefficient estimation in autonomous
driving.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为IKMR的隐式运动动力学运动重定向框架，能够高效地将大规模人类运动转换为机器人可执行的运动轨迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的运动重定向方法通常逐帧处理，缺乏可扩展性。需要一种更高效的方法来直接将大规模人类运动转换为机器人可执行的运动。

Method: IKMR框架包含运动学预训练和动力学集成两部分：运动学方面预训练运动拓扑特征表示和双编码器-解码器架构；动力学方面将模仿学习与运动重定向网络结合，优化为物理可行的轨迹。

Result: 在仿真和真实全尺寸人形机器人上的实验验证了该框架的有效性，能够实现实时的大规模物理可行运动重定向。

Conclusion: IKMR框架为人类到人形机器人的模仿学习提供了一种高效可扩展的解决方案，可直接训练全身控制器来跟踪重定向后的轨迹。

Abstract: Human-to-humanoid imitation learning aims to learn a humanoid whole-body
controller from human motion. Motion retargeting is a crucial step in enabling
robots to acquire reference trajectories when exploring locomotion skills.
However, current methods focus on motion retargeting frame by frame, which
lacks scalability. Could we directly convert large-scale human motion into
robot-executable motion through a more efficient approach? To address this
issue, we propose Implicit Kinodynamic Motion Retargeting (IKMR), a novel
efficient and scalable retargeting framework that considers both kinematics and
dynamics. In kinematics, IKMR pretrains motion topology feature representation
and a dual encoder-decoder architecture to learn a motion domain mapping. In
dynamics, IKMR integrates imitation learning with the motion retargeting
network to refine motion into physically feasible trajectories. After
fine-tuning using the tracking results, IKMR can achieve large-scale physically
feasible motion retargeting in real time, and a whole-body controller could be
directly trained and deployed for tracking its retargeted trajectories. We
conduct our experiments both in the simulator and the real robot on a full-size
humanoid robot. Extensive experiments and evaluation results verify the
effectiveness of our proposed framework.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种可解释AI增强的多智能体机器人监督控制框架，结合定时自动机监督器、鲁棒连续控制和可解释预测器，在航天器编队飞行和自主水下车辆两个领域验证了方法的有效性和可移植性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个安全、可审计且可解释的多智能体机器人控制框架，解决复杂环境中不确定动态系统的鲁棒控制和性能优化问题。

Method: 结合定时自动机监督器进行安全模式切换，使用Lyapunov控制器进行大角度机动，滑动模式控制器进行精确控制和扰动抑制，通过蒙特卡洛优化生成训练数据，实现实时透明权衡。

Result: 在航天器任务中，SMC控制器相比PD控制器实现了亚毫米级对齐，跟踪误差降低21.7%，能耗降低81.4%；在AUV测试中，SMC在随机海流下保持有界稳态误差。

Conclusion: 该方法在安全关键、资源受限的多智能体机器人系统中具有可移植性和可解释性优势。

Abstract: We present an explainable AI-enhanced supervisory control framework for
multi-agent robotics that combines (i) a timed-automata supervisor for safe,
auditable mode switching, (ii) robust continuous control (Lyapunov-based
controller for large-angle maneuver; sliding-mode controller (SMC) with
boundary layers for precision and disturbance rejection), and (iii) an
explainable predictor that maps mission context to gains and expected
performance (energy, error). Monte Carlo-driven optimization provides the
training data, enabling transparent real-time trade-offs.
  We validated the approach in two contrasting domains, spacecraft formation
flying and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). Despite different
environments (gravity/actuator bias vs. hydrodynamic drag/currents), both share
uncertain six degrees of freedom (6-DOF) rigid-body dynamics, relative motion,
and tight tracking needs, making them representative of general robotic
systems. In the space mission, the supervisory logic selects parameters that
meet mission criteria. In AUV leader-follower tests, the same SMC structure
maintains a fixed offset under stochastic currents with bounded steady error.
In spacecraft validation, the SMC controller achieved submillimeter alignment
with 21.7% lower tracking error and 81.4% lower energy consumption compared to
Proportional-Derivative PD controller baselines. At the same time, in AUV
tests, SMC maintained bounded errors under stochastic currents. These results
highlight both the portability and the interpretability of the approach for
safety-critical, resource-constrained multi-agent robotics.

Conclusion: STARC系统通过实时可视化隐藏的受害者和危险，增强了态势感知并降低了操作风险，在消防、救灾等安全关键操作中具有应用潜力。

Abstract: In emergency response missions, first responders must navigate cluttered
indoor environments where occlusions block direct line-of-sight, concealing
both life-threatening hazards and victims in need of rescue. We present STARC,
a see-through AR framework for human-robot collaboration that fuses
mobile-robot mapping with responder-mounted LiDAR sensing. A ground robot
running LiDAR-inertial odometry performs large-area exploration and 3D human
detection, while helmet- or handheld-mounted LiDAR on the responder is
registered to the robot's global map via relative pose estimation. This
cross-LiDAR alignment enables consistent first-person projection of detected
humans and their point clouds - rendered in AR with low latency - into the
responder's view. By providing real-time visualization of hidden occupants and
hazards, STARC enhances situational awareness and reduces operator risk.
Experiments in simulation, lab setups, and tactical field trials confirm robust
pose alignment, reliable detections, and stable overlays, underscoring the
potential of our system for fire-fighting, disaster relief, and other
safety-critical operations. Code and design will be open-sourced upon
acceptance.

Conclusion: 该方法通过捕捉多模态解分布有效解决了模糊场景下的数据关联问题，优于传统单一解方法

Abstract: Global data association is an essential prerequisite for robot operation in
environments seen at different times or by different robots. Repetitive or
symmetric data creates significant challenges for existing methods, which
typically rely on maximum likelihood estimation or maximum consensus to produce
a single set of associations. However, in ambiguous scenarios, the distribution
of solutions to global data association problems is often highly multimodal,
and such single-solution approaches frequently fail. In this work, we introduce
a data association framework that leverages approximate Bayesian inference to
capture multiple solution modes to the data association problem, thereby
avoiding premature commitment to a single solution under ambiguity. Our
approach represents hypothetical solutions as particles that evolve according
to a deterministic or randomized update rule to cover the modes of the
underlying solution distribution. Furthermore, we show that our method can
incorporate optimization constraints imposed by the data association
formulation and directly benefit from GPU-parallelized optimization. Extensive
simulated and real-world experiments with highly ambiguous data show that our
method correctly estimates the distribution over transformations when
registering point clouds or object maps.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种动量约束混合启发式轨迹优化框架（MHHTOF），用于视觉障碍场景下的辅助导航，整合了轨迹采样生成、优化和残差增强深度强化学习的评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对视觉障碍场景下的辅助导航需求，开发一个能够确保平滑性、可行性并支持人本优化的轨迹规划框架。

Method: 采用双阶段方法：第一阶段在Frenet坐标系中使用三阶插值和五阶多项式生成启发式轨迹采样簇，并应用动量约束轨迹优化；第二阶段在笛卡尔坐标系中使用基于LSTM的残差增强actor-critic网络自适应优化轨迹选择。

Result: LSTM-ResB-PPO方法相比PPO基线收敛速度显著加快，训练迭代次数减半，同时提升奖励结果和训练稳定性。平均成本和成本方差分别降低30.3%和53.3%，自我和障碍风险降低超过77%。

Conclusion: 该框架在复杂辅助规划任务中有效提升了鲁棒性、安全性和实时可行性。

Abstract: This paper proposes a momentum-constrained hybrid heuristic trajectory
optimization framework (MHHTOF) tailored for assistive navigation in visually
impaired scenarios, integrating trajectory sampling generation, optimization
and evaluation with residual-enhanced deep reinforcement learning (DRL). In the
first stage, heuristic trajectory sampling cluster (HTSC) is generated in the
Frenet coordinate system using third-order interpolation with fifth-order
polynomials and momentum-constrained trajectory optimization (MTO) constraints
to ensure smoothness and feasibility. After first stage cost evaluation, the
second stage leverages a residual-enhanced actor-critic network with LSTM-based
temporal feature modeling to adaptively refine trajectory selection in the
Cartesian coordinate system. A dual-stage cost modeling mechanism (DCMM) with
weight transfer aligns semantic priorities across stages, supporting
human-centered optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
LSTM-ResB-PPO achieves significantly faster convergence, attaining stable
policy performance in approximately half the training iterations required by
the PPO baseline, while simultaneously enhancing both reward outcomes and
training stability. Compared to baseline method, the selected model reduces
average cost and cost variance by 30.3% and 53.3%, and lowers ego and obstacle
risks by over 77%. These findings validate the framework's effectiveness in
enhancing robustness, safety, and real-time feasibility in complex assistive
planning tasks.

Abstract: Vehicle localization using roadside LiDARs can provide centimeter-level
accuracy for cloud-controlled vehicles while simultaneously serving multiple
vehicles, enhanc-ing safety and efficiency. While most existing studies rely on
repetitive scanning LiDARs, non-repetitive scanning LiDAR offers advantages
such as eliminating blind zones and being more cost-effective. However, its
application in roadside perception and localization remains limited. To address
this, we present a dataset for infrastructure-based vehicle localization, with
data collected from both repetitive and non-repetitive scanning LiDARs, in
order to benchmark the performance of different LiDAR scanning patterns. The
dataset contains 5,445 frames of point clouds across eight vehicle trajectory
sequences, with diverse trajectory types. Our experiments establish base-lines
for infrastructure-based vehicle localization and compare the performance of
these methods using both non-repetitive and repetitive scanning LiDARs. This
work offers valuable insights for selecting the most suitable LiDAR scanning
pattern for infrastruc-ture-based vehicle localization. Our dataset is a
signifi-cant contribution to the scientific community, supporting advancements
in infrastructure-based perception and vehicle localization. The dataset and

Abstract: Efficiently delivering items to an ongoing surgery in a hospital operating
room can be a matter of life or death. In modern hospital settings, delivery
robots have successfully transported bulk items between rooms and floors.
However, automating item-level operating room logistics presents unique
challenges in perception, efficiency, and maintaining sterility. We propose the
Operating Room Bot (ORB), a robot framework to automate logistics tasks in
hospital operating rooms (OR). ORB leverages a robust, hierarchical behavior

contributions of this paper include: (1) a modular software architecture
facilitating robust mobile manipulation through behavior trees; (2) a novel
real-time object recognition pipeline integrating YOLOv7, Segment Anything
Model 2 (SAM2), and Grounded DINO; (3) the adaptation of the cuRobo
parallelized trajectory optimization framework to real-time, collision-free

Conclusion: PRIMT通过创新的多模态融合和轨迹处理技术，有效提升了偏好强化学习的性能，减少了对外部人工反馈的依赖。

Abstract: Preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) has emerged as a promising
paradigm for teaching robots complex behaviors without reward engineering.
However, its effectiveness is often limited by two critical challenges: the
reliance on extensive human input and the inherent difficulties in resolving
query ambiguity and credit assignment during reward learning. In this paper, we
introduce PRIMT, a PbRL framework designed to overcome these challenges by
leveraging foundation models (FMs) for multimodal synthetic feedback and
trajectory synthesis. Unlike prior approaches that rely on single-modality FM
evaluations, PRIMT employs a hierarchical neuro-symbolic fusion strategy,
integrating the complementary strengths of large language models and
vision-language models in evaluating robot behaviors for more reliable and
comprehensive feedback. PRIMT also incorporates foresight trajectory
generation, which reduces early-stage query ambiguity by warm-starting the
trajectory buffer with bootstrapped samples, and hindsight trajectory
augmentation, which enables counterfactual reasoning with a causal auxiliary
loss to improve credit assignment. We evaluate PRIMT on 2 locomotion and 6
manipulation tasks on various benchmarks, demonstrating superior performance
over FM-based and scripted baselines.

TL;DR: SMART是一个分层多车辆轨迹规划框架，结合优先级搜索和分布式优化，在密集环境中实现高效可行的多车辆协调规划


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多车辆轨迹规划是非凸问题，在密集环境中由于碰撞约束快速增长而变得困难，需要高效探索可行行为并解决紧密交互以实现实时大规模协调

Conclusion: SMART框架通过车辆到一切通信和车辆-基础设施合作，显著提高了多车辆轨迹规划的可扩展性和安全性，在密集环境中实现了高效的实时协调

Abstract: Multi-vehicle trajectory planning is a non-convex problem that becomes
increasingly difficult in dense environments due to the rapid growth of
collision constraints. Efficient exploration of feasible behaviors and
resolution of tight interactions are essential for real-time, large-scale
coordination. This paper introduces SMART, Scalable Multi-Agent Reasoning and
Trajectory Planning, a hierarchical framework that combines priority-based
search with distributed optimization to achieve efficient and feasible
multi-vehicle planning. The upper layer explores diverse interaction modes
using reinforcement learning-based priority estimation and large-step hybrid A*
search, while the lower layer refines solutions via parallelizable convex
optimization. By partitioning space among neighboring vehicles and constructing
robust feasible corridors, the method decouples the joint non-convex problem
into convex subproblems solved efficiently in parallel. This design alleviates
the step-size trade-off while ensuring kinematic feasibility and collision
avoidance. Experiments show that SMART consistently outperforms baselines. On
50 m x 50 m maps, it sustains over 90% success within 1 s up to 25 vehicles,
while baselines often drop below 50%. On 100 m x 100 m maps, SMART achieves
above 95% success up to 50 vehicles and remains feasible up to 90 vehicles,
with runtimes more than an order of magnitude faster than optimization-only
approaches. Built on vehicle-to-everything communication, SMART incorporates
vehicle-infrastructure cooperation through roadside sensing and agent
coordination, improving scalability and safety. Real-world experiments further
validate this design, achieving planning times as low as 0.014 s while
preserving cooperative behaviors.

Motivation: 现有磁性微型机器人要么功能受限（最多两种功能），要么只有五自由度运动能力，且需要在强磁场近距离（<4cm）下操作，限制了其在手术中的实际应用。

Method: 开发了一种毫米级软体机器人，其磁化轮廓可根据指令重新编程，使用相对均匀且弱的外部磁场（最多65mT和1.5T/m）进行控制。

Conclusion: 这项工作是软体致动器发展的一个重要里程碑，有望通过具有前所未有功能的无线微型机器人彻底改变微创治疗方式。

Abstract: Miniature robots are untethered actuators, which have significant potential
to make existing minimally invasive surgery considerably safer and painless,
and enable unprecedented treatments because they are much smaller and dexterous
than existing surgical robots. Of the miniature robots, the magnetically
actuated ones are the most functional and dexterous. However, existing magnetic
miniature robots are currently impractical for surgery because they are either
restricted to possessing at most two on-board functionalities or having limited
five degrees-of-freedom (DOF) locomotion. Some of these actuators are also only
operational under specialized environments where actuation from strong external
magnets must be at very close proximity (< 4 cm away). Here we present a
millimeter-scale soft robot where its magnetization profile can be reprogrammed
upon command to perform five surgical functionalities: drug-dispensing, cutting
through biological tissues (simulated with gelatin), gripping, storing
(biological) samples and remote heating. By possessing full six-DOF motions,
including the sixth-DOF rotation about its net magnetic moment, our soft robot
can also roll and two-anchor crawl across challenging unstructured
environments, which are impassable by its five-DOF counterparts. Because our
actuating magnetic fields are relatively uniform and weak (at most 65 mT and
1.5 T/m), such fields can theoretically penetrate through biological tissues
harmlessly and allow our soft robot to remain controllable within the depths of
the human body. We envision that this work marks a major milestone for the
advancement of soft actuators, and towards revolutionizing minimally invasive
treatments with untethered miniature robots that have unprecedented
functionalities.

validated through hardware experiments on a small ground robot, where a human
operator dynamically assigns target locations. The robot successfully navigated
through complex environments and reached new targets within 2-3 seconds.

Abstract: Visual observations from different viewpoints can significantly influence the
performance of visuomotor policies in robotic manipulation. Among these,
egocentric (in-hand) views often provide crucial information for precise
control. However, in some applications, equipping robots with dedicated in-hand
cameras may pose challenges due to hardware constraints, system complexity, and
cost. In this work, we propose to endow robots with imaginative perception -
enabling them to 'imagine' in-hand observations from agent views at inference
time. We achieve this via novel view synthesis (NVS), leveraging a fine-tuned
diffusion model conditioned on the relative pose between the agent and in-hand
views cameras. Specifically, we apply LoRA-based fine-tuning to adapt a
pretrained NVS model (ZeroNVS) to the robotic manipulation domain. We evaluate
our approach on both simulation benchmarks (RoboMimic and MimicGen) and
real-world experiments using a Unitree Z1 robotic arm for a strawberry picking
task. Results show that synthesized in-hand views significantly enhance policy
inference, effectively recovering the performance drop caused by the absence of
real in-hand cameras. Our method offers a scalable and hardware-light solution
for deploying robust visuomotor policies, highlighting the potential of
imaginative visual reasoning in embodied agents.

Result: 在模拟基准测试中一致优于最先进方法，无需深度传感器或预建地图即可有效迁移到真实机器人，仅需少量微调。

Conclusion: GP3是一个实用的、传感器无关的几何感知机器人操作解决方案。

Abstract: Effective robotic manipulation relies on a precise understanding of 3D scene
geometry, and one of the most straightforward ways to acquire such geometry is
through multi-view observations. Motivated by this, we present GP3 -- a 3D
geometry-aware robotic manipulation policy that leverages multi-view input. GP3
employs a spatial encoder to infer dense spatial features from RGB
observations, which enable the estimation of depth and camera parameters,
leading to a compact yet expressive 3D scene representation tailored for
manipulation. This representation is fused with language instructions and
translated into continuous actions via a lightweight policy head. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that GP3 consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
methods on simulated benchmarks. Furthermore, GP3 transfers effectively to
real-world robots without depth sensors or pre-mapped environments, requiring
only minimal fine-tuning. These results highlight GP3 as a practical,
sensor-agnostic solution for geometry-aware robotic manipulation.

Conclusion: FlyKites框架有效解决了有限通信条件下多机器人系统的探索和人类协助问题。

Abstract: Fleets of autonomous robots have been deployed for exploration of unknown
scenes for features of interest, e.g., subterranean exploration,
reconnaissance, search and rescue missions. During exploration, the robots may
encounter un-identified targets, blocked passages, interactive objects,
temporary failure, or other unexpected events, all of which require consistent
human assistance with reliable communication for a time period. This however
can be particularly challenging if the communication among the robots is
severely restricted to only close-range exchange via ad-hoc networks,
especially in extreme environments like caves and underground tunnels. This
paper presents a novel human-centric interactive exploration and assistance
framework called FlyKites, for multi-robot systems under limited communication.
It consists of three interleaved components: (I) the distributed exploration
and intermittent communication (called the "spread mode"), where the robots
collaboratively explore the environment and exchange local data among the fleet
and with the operator; (II) the simultaneous optimization of the relay
topology, the operator path, and the assignment of robots to relay roles
(called the "relay mode"), such that all requested assistance can be provided
with minimum delay; (III) the human-in-the-loop online execution, where the
robots switch between different roles and interact with the operator
adaptively. Extensive human-in-the-loop simulations and hardware experiments
are performed over numerous challenging scenes.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于多智能体深度强化学习的无人机群多包裹配送优化方法，通过分解问题为三个子问题：K-means聚类优化仓库位置、强化学习确定最优飞行范围、优化路径选择，实现了节能高效的时间敏感配送。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机在最后一公里配送中具有速度快、安全性高、成本低的优势，特别是在疫情期间的紧急医疗配送中表现突出。但多包裹配送中面临电池限制和时间敏感需求的挑战，需要优化配送效率和能耗。

Method: 将问题分解为三个子问题：1）使用K-means聚类优化仓库位置和服务区域；2）通过强化学习确定无人机最优飞行范围；3）采用新的优化计划选择方法规划多包裹配送路线。整合这些解决方案，提出基于actor-critic的多智能体深度强化学习算法。

Result: 使用真实配送数据集进行广泛实验，证明所提算法在节能（最小化能耗）、快速操作（减少配送延迟和总执行时间）以及仓库部署策略指导方面表现出色。

Conclusion: 该研究为实际物流应用提供了经济高效、快速操作的无人机配送解决方案，并在仓库部署策略方面提供了新的见解。

Abstract: Drones have recently emerged as a faster, safer, and cost-efficient way for
last-mile deliveries of parcels, particularly for urgent medical deliveries
highlighted during the pandemic. This paper addresses a new challenge of
multi-parcel delivery with a swarm of energy-aware drones, accounting for
time-sensitive customer requirements. Each drone plans an optimal multi-parcel
route within its battery-restricted flight range to minimize delivery delays
and reduce energy consumption. The problem is tackled by decomposing it into
three sub-problems: (1) optimizing depot locations and service areas using
K-means clustering; (2) determining the optimal flight range for drones through
reinforcement learning; and (3) planning and selecting multi-parcel delivery
routes via a new optimized plan selection approach. To integrate these
solutions and enhance long-term efficiency, we propose a novel algorithm
leveraging actor-critic-based multi-agent deep reinforcement learning.
Extensive experimentation using realistic delivery datasets demonstrate an
exceptional performance of the proposed algorithm. We provide new insights into
economic efficiency (minimize energy consumption), rapid operations (reduce
delivery delays and overall execution time), and strategic guidance on depot
deployment for practical logistics applications.

TL;DR: VLAC是一个基于InternVL构建的通用过程奖励模型，通过大规模异构数据集训练，能够为机器人视觉语言动作（VLA）强化学习提供密集的进度奖励和完成信号，无需任务特定的奖励工程，并支持一次性上下文迁移到未见过的任务和环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器人真实世界强化学习中稀疏、手工制作的奖励和低效探索的问题，通过构建通用过程奖励模型来消除任务特定的奖励工程需求。

Method: 基于InternVL构建VLAC模型，在大规模异构数据集上训练，包括视觉语言数据集（增强感知、对话和推理能力）以及机器人和人类轨迹数据（基础动作生成和进度估计）。通过构建大量负样本和语义不匹配样本来增强模型拒绝无关提示和检测回归或停滞的能力。采用提示控制，单个VLAC模型交替生成奖励和动作标记，统一评论家和策略。在异步真实世界强化学习循环中部署，结合分级的人类参与协议（离线演示回放、返回和探索、人类引导探索）来加速探索和稳定早期学习。

Result: 在四个不同的真实世界操作任务中，VLAC在200个真实世界交互周期内将成功率从约30%提升到约90%；结合人类参与干预，样本效率进一步提高50%，最终成功率可达100%。

Conclusion: VLAC通过通用过程奖励模型有效解决了机器人真实世界强化学习的瓶颈问题，显著提升了学习效率和最终性能，展示了在未见任务和环境中的强大迁移能力。

Abstract: Robotic real-world reinforcement learning (RL) with vision-language-action
(VLA) models is bottlenecked by sparse, handcrafted rewards and inefficient
exploration. We introduce VLAC, a general process reward model built upon
InternVL and trained on large scale heterogeneous datasets. Given pairwise
observations and a language goal, it outputs dense progress delta and done
signal, eliminating task-specific reward engineering, and supports one-shot
in-context transfer to unseen tasks and environments. VLAC is trained on
vision-language datasets to strengthen perception, dialogic and reasoning
capabilities, together with robot and human trajectories data that ground
action generation and progress estimation, and additionally strengthened to
reject irrelevant prompts as well as detect regression or stagnation by
constructing large numbers of negative and semantically mismatched samples.
With prompt control, a single VLAC model alternately generating reward and
action tokens, unifying critic and policy. Deployed inside an asynchronous
real-world RL loop, we layer a graded human-in-the-loop protocol (offline
demonstration replay, return and explore, human guided explore) that
accelerates exploration and stabilizes early learning. Across four distinct
real-world manipulation tasks, VLAC lifts success rates from about 30\% to
about 90\% within 200 real-world interaction episodes; incorporating
human-in-the-loop interventions yields a further 50% improvement in sample
efficiency and achieves up to 100% final success.

TL;DR: 提出一种纯触觉反馈的抓取调整算法，无需物体几何先验知识或精确抓取姿态，能够从粗糙初始配置和不确定接触点中优化抓取


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉抓取系统受限于校准误差、传感器噪声和抓取姿态预测不准确，导致最终抓取阶段存在不可避免的接触不确定性

Method: 设计基于高带宽触觉反馈的触觉反应控制器，在15自由度臂手系统上进行仿真和真实实验，指尖触觉传感器以200Hz频率运行

Result: 触觉反应抓取框架有效提高了抓取稳定性

Conclusion: 高带宽触觉反馈与精心设计的触觉反应控制器相结合，能够显著提高在感知误差存在情况下的抓取鲁棒性

Abstract: Vision-only grasping systems are fundamentally constrained by calibration
errors, sensor noise, and grasp pose prediction inaccuracies, leading to
unavoidable contact uncertainty in the final stage of grasping. High-bandwidth
tactile feedback, when paired with a well-designed tactile-reactive controller,
can significantly improve robustness in the presence of perception errors. This
paper contributes to controller design by proposing a purely tactile-feedback
grasp-adjustment algorithm. The proposed controller requires neither prior
knowledge of the object's geometry nor an accurate grasp pose, and is capable
of refining a grasp even when starting from a crude, imprecise initial
configuration and uncertain contact points. Through simulation studies and
real-world experiments on a 15-DoF arm-hand system (featuring an 8-DoF hand)
equipped with fingertip tactile sensors operating at 200 Hz, we demonstrate
that our tactile-reactive grasping framework effectively improves grasp
stability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决通用机器人组合泛化能力不足的问题，特别是现有视觉运动策略在场景组合引起的分布偏移下容易失败的问题。

Method: 开发了基于场景图的技能学习框架，结合图神经网络和扩散模仿学习，并与基于视觉语言模型的任务规划器集成。

Result: 在仿真和真实世界操作任务中，相比最先进基线方法获得了显著更高的成功率。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提高了长视野任务中的鲁棒性和组合泛化能力，为通用机器人系统提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: A key requirement for generalist robots is compositional generalization - the
ability to combine atomic skills to solve complex, long-horizon tasks. While
prior work has primarily focused on synthesizing a planner that sequences
pre-learned skills, robust execution of the individual skills themselves
remains challenging, as visuomotor policies often fail under distribution
shifts induced by scene composition. To address this, we introduce a scene
graph-based representation that focuses on task-relevant objects and relations,
thereby mitigating sensitivity to irrelevant variation. Building on this idea,
we develop a scene-graph skill learning framework that integrates graph neural
networks with diffusion-based imitation learning, and further combine "focused"
scene-graph skills with a vision-language model (VLM) based task planner.
Experiments in both simulation and real-world manipulation tasks demonstrate
substantially higher success rates than state-of-the-art baselines,
highlighting improved robustness and compositional generalization in
long-horizon tasks.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种高效的几何感知视觉编码器eVGGT，通过从VGGT进行知识蒸馏，在保持强大3D推理能力的同时显著降低了计算成本，并将该编码器集成到模仿学习框架中，在机器人操作任务上取得了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于RGB的模仿学习方法使用传统视觉编码器（如ResNet、ViT）缺乏显式的3D推理能力，而现有的几何感知视觉模型虽然能提供强大的空间理解能力，但计算成本过高，限制了在实际机器人系统中的部署。

Method: 提出eVGGT，一种从VGGT进行知识蒸馏得到的高效几何感知编码器；将几何感知视觉表示集成到模仿学习框架（包括ACT和DP）中。

Result: 在仿真和真实世界的单臂和双臂操作任务中，使用几何感知视觉编码器的模仿学习方法比标准视觉编码器的成功率提高了6.5%；eVGGT比VGGT快近9倍，模型大小小5倍，同时保持了强大的3D推理能力。

Conclusion: 几何感知视觉表示能显著提升机器人操作性能，而提出的eVGGT在保持性能的同时解决了计算成本问题，为几何感知机器人研究提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Existing RGB-based imitation learning approaches typically employ traditional
vision encoders such as ResNet or ViT, which lack explicit 3D reasoning
capabilities. Recent geometry-grounded vision models, such as
VGGT~\cite{wang2025vggt}, provide robust spatial understanding and are
promising candidates to address this limitation. This work investigates the
integration of geometry-aware visual representations into robotic manipulation.
Our results suggest that incorporating the geometry-aware vision encoder into
imitation learning frameworks, including ACT and DP, yields up to 6.5%
improvement over standard vision encoders in success rate across single- and
bi-manual manipulation tasks in both simulation and real-world settings.
Despite these benefits, most geometry-grounded models require high
computational cost, limiting their deployment in practical robotic systems. To
address this challenge, we propose eVGGT, an efficient geometry-aware encoder
distilled from VGGT. eVGGT is nearly 9 times faster and 5 times smaller than
VGGT, while preserving strong 3D reasoning capabilities. Code and pretrained
models will be released to facilitate further research in geometry-aware
robotics.

TL;DR: 提出Right-Side-Out框架，通过任务分解和高效仿真解决衣物翻转这一具有挑战性的动态操作任务，实现零样本从仿真到现实的迁移


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 衣物翻转任务具有高度动态性、快速接触变化和严重视觉遮挡等挑战，需要一种无需人工演示的解决方案

Method: 将任务分解为Drag/Fling和Insert&Pull两个步骤，使用基于深度推断的关键点参数化双手机器人基元；构建基于MPM的高保真仿真器进行高效数据生成

Result: 仅使用单个深度相机，在真实硬件上实现零样本部署，成功率高达81.3%

Conclusion: 通过任务分解和高保真仿真，该框架能够处理高度动态、严重遮挡的任务，无需繁琐的人工演示

Abstract: Turning garments right-side out is a challenging manipulation task: it is
highly dynamic, entails rapid contact changes, and is subject to severe visual
occlusion. We introduce Right-Side-Out, a zero-shot sim-to-real framework that
effectively solves this challenge by exploiting task structures. We decompose
the task into Drag/Fling to create and stabilize an access opening, followed by
Insert&Pull to invert the garment. Each step uses a depth-inferred,
keypoint-parameterized bimanual primitive that sharply reduces the action space
while preserving robustness. Efficient data generation is enabled by our
custom-built, high-fidelity, GPU-parallel Material Point Method (MPM) simulator
that models thin-shell deformation and provides robust and efficient contact
handling for batched rollouts. Built on the simulator, our fully automated
pipeline scales data generation by randomizing garment geometry, material
parameters, and viewpoints, producing depth, masks, and per-primitive keypoint
labels without any human annotations. With a single depth camera, policies
trained entirely in simulation deploy zero-shot on real hardware, achieving up
to 81.3% success rate. By employing task decomposition and high fidelity
simulation, our framework enables tackling highly dynamic, severely occluded
tasks without laborious human demonstrations.

TL;DR: Swarm Oracle提出了一种去中心化的机器人群体网络，利用机载传感器和点对点通信来集体验证现实世界数据并提供给区块链智能合约，解决了区块链共识机制无法直接访问现实世界数据的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 区块链共识机制基于"不信任，验证"原则，限制了访问现实世界数据的能力，这些数据可能模糊或对某些参与者不可访问。现有预言机解决方案可能降低自主性、透明度或重新引入信任需求。

Method: 采用拜占庭容错协议，使来自不同利益相关者的机器人能够协同工作，达成比单个机器人估计更高质量的社会共识。通过真实和模拟机器人的广泛实验验证系统性能。

Result: 实验表明，即使在大量机器人发起多种攻击的情况下，也能在不确定的环境信息上达成共识。基于区块链代币的声誉系统让Swarm Oracle能够自主从故障和攻击中恢复。

Conclusion: Swarm Oracle利用机器人群体固有的去中心化、容错性和移动性，为区块链提供安全、无需信任的全球共识，能够灵活适应远程位置的信息请求，是长期运营的可行解决方案。

Abstract: Blockchain consensus, rooted in the principle ``don't trust, verify'', limits
access to real-world data, which may be ambiguous or inaccessible to some
participants. Oracles address this limitation by supplying data to blockchains,
but existing solutions may reduce autonomy, transparency, or reintroduce the
need for trust. We propose Swarm Oracle: a decentralized network of autonomous
robots -- that is, a robot swarm -- that use onboard sensors and peer-to-peer
communication to collectively verify real-world data and provide it to smart
contracts on public blockchains. Swarm Oracle leverages the built-in
decentralization, fault tolerance and mobility of robot swarms, which can
flexibly adapt to meet information requests on-demand, even in remote
locations. Unlike typical cooperative robot swarms, Swarm Oracle integrates
robots from multiple stakeholders, protecting the system from single-party
biases but also introducing potential adversarial behavior. To ensure the
secure, trustless and global consensus required by blockchains, we employ a
Byzantine fault-tolerant protocol that enables robots from different
stakeholders to operate together, reaching social agreements of higher quality
than the estimates of individual robots. Through extensive experiments using
both real and simulated robots, we showcase how consensus on uncertain
environmental information can be achieved, despite several types of attacks
orchestrated by large proportions of the robots, and how a reputation system
based on blockchain tokens lets Swarm Oracle autonomously recover from faults
and attacks, a requirement for long-term operation.

TL;DR: CoReVLA是一个持续学习的端到端自动驾驶框架，通过双阶段数据收集和行为优化过程，提升在长尾安全关键场景下的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶系统在长尾安全关键场景中表现有限，这些罕见情况导致不成比例的事故数量。视觉语言动作模型具有强大推理能力但受限于高质量数据缺乏和低效学习。

Method: 1) 在开源驾驶QA数据集上联合微调获得基础理解；2) 在CAVE仿真平台部署并收集驾驶员接管数据；3) 通过直接偏好优化从人类偏好中学习，避免奖励设计导致的奖励黑客问题。

Result: 在Bench2Drive基准测试中，CoReVLA获得72.18驾驶分数和50%成功率，在长尾安全关键场景下分别比最先进方法提升7.96分和15%。案例研究显示模型能利用过往接管经验持续改进。

Conclusion: CoReVLA框架通过持续学习和人类偏好优化，有效提升了自动驾驶系统在长尾安全关键场景中的性能，展示了持续改进的潜力。

Abstract: Autonomous Driving (AD) systems have made notable progress, but their
performance in long-tail, safety-critical scenarios remains limited. These rare
cases contribute a disproportionate number of accidents. Vision-Language Action
(VLA) models have strong reasoning abilities and offer a potential solution,
but their effectiveness is limited by the lack of high-quality data and
inefficient learning in such conditions. To address these challenges, we
propose CoReVLA, a continual learning end-to-end autonomous driving framework
that improves the performance in long-tail scenarios through a dual-stage
process of data Collection and behavior Refinement. First, the model is jointly
fine-tuned on a mixture of open-source driving QA datasets, allowing it to
acquire a foundational understanding of driving scenarios. Next, CoReVLA is
deployed within the Cave Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE) simulation
platform, where driver takeover data is collected from real-time interactions.
Each takeover indicates a long-tail scenario that CoReVLA fails to handle
reliably. Finally, the model is refined via Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO), allowing it to learn directly from human preferences and thereby avoid
reward hacking caused by manually designed rewards. Extensive open-loop and
closed-loop experiments demonstrate that the proposed CoReVLA model can
accurately perceive driving scenarios and make appropriate decisions. On the
Bench2Drive benchmark, CoReVLA achieves a Driving Score (DS) of 72.18 and a
Success Rate (SR) of 50%, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 7.96 DS and
15% SR under long-tail, safety-critical scenarios. Furthermore, case studies
demonstrate the model's ability to continually improve its performance in
similar failure-prone scenarios by leveraging past takeover experiences. All

Motivation: 在工业和农业等动态不可预测环境中，自动化劳动密集型复杂活动的需求日益增长。这些活动具有可变性，且需要人类监控以确保安全关键流程的正确执行。

Method: 开发了一个集成LLM与自动规划的通用架构，使用自然语言指定高级活动，并通过查询机器人实现执行监控。采用最先进组件实现了该架构。

Result: 在真实世界的精准农业场景中对该方法进行了定量评估，验证了架构的有效性。

Conclusion: 该集成架构为动态环境中复杂活动的自动化提供了一种有效解决方案，通过自然语言交互增强了人机协作能力。

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a growing interest in automating labor-intensive
and complex activities, i.e., those consisting of multiple atomic tasks, by
deploying robots in dynamic and unpredictable environments such as industrial
and agricultural settings. A key characteristic of these contexts is that
activities are not predefined: while they involve a limited set of possible
tasks, their combinations may vary depending on the situation. Moreover,
despite recent advances in robotics, the ability for humans to monitor the
progress of high-level activities - in terms of past, present, and future
actions - remains fundamental to ensure the correct execution of
safety-critical processes. In this paper, we introduce a general architecture
that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with automated planning, enabling
humans to specify high-level activities (also referred to as processes) using
natural language, and to monitor their execution by querying a robot. We also
present an implementation of this architecture using state-of-the-art
components and quantitatively evaluate the approach in a real-world precision
agriculture scenario.

Motivation: 人类互动中身高较高者通常被认为更具说服力，本研究旨在验证这种影响是否在人类与高度非人形机器人的互动中复现。

Method: 设计模块化机器人，通过增减模块改变高度（95cm vs 132cm），在参与者完成主要实验后，让机器人邀请其自愿完成300个问题的问卷，比较两种高度条件下的服从率。

Result: 较矮的机器人获得更高的服从率，这与人类互动模式相反。

Conclusion: 机器人高度对人类-机器人互动有显著社会影响，但这种影响遵循独特的模式，设计师不能简单地将人类社交动态元素直接应用于机器人设计。

Abstract: Robots come in various forms and have different characteristics that may
shape the interaction with them. In human-human interactions, height is a
characteristic that shapes human dynamics, with taller people typically
perceived as more persuasive. In this work, we aspired to evaluate if the same
impact replicates in a human-robot interaction and specifically with a highly
non-humanoid robotic object. The robot was designed with modules that could be
easily added or removed, allowing us to change its height without altering
other design features. To test the impact of the robot's height, we evaluated
participants' compliance with its request to volunteer to perform a tedious
task. In the experiment, participants performed a cognitive task on a computer,
which was framed as the main experiment. When done, they were informed that the
experiment was completed. While waiting to receive their credits, the robotic
object, designed as a mobile robotic service table, entered the room, carrying
a tablet that invited participants to complete a 300-question questionnaire
voluntarily. We compared participants' compliance in two conditions: A Short
robot composed of two modules and 95cm in height and a Tall robot consisting of
three modules and 132cm in height. Our findings revealed higher compliance with
the Short robot's request, demonstrating an opposite pattern to human dynamics.
We conclude that while height has a substantial social impact on human-robot
interactions, it follows a unique pattern of influence. Our findings suggest
that designers cannot simply adopt and implement elements from human social
dynamics to robots without testing them first.

Motivation: 现有CBF方法依赖于解析间距计算（对复杂几何不可行）或多面体近似（在未知机器人配置时计算困难），需要解决这些限制以实现复杂几何机器人在杂乱环境中的安全导航。

Method: 训练残差神经网络预测间距，定义局部安全球（LSB），将LSB边界编码为离散时间高阶CBF（DHOCBF），结合非线性优化框架和新颖的松弛技术确保可行性。

Conclusion: 所提框架在安全性和效率方面超越现有CBF方法，有效桥接离散时间控制和连续时间安全性。

Abstract: Obstacle avoidance is central to safe navigation, especially for robots with
arbitrary and nonconvex geometries operating in cluttered environments.
Existing Control Barrier Function (CBF) approaches often rely on analytic
clearance computations, which are infeasible for complex geometries, or on
polytopic approximations, which become intractable when robot configurations
are unknown. To address these limitations, this paper trains a residual neural
network on a large dataset of robot-obstacle configurations to enable fast and
tractable clearance prediction, even at unseen configurations. The predicted
clearance defines the radius of a Local Safety Ball (LSB), which ensures
continuous-time collision-free navigation. The LSB boundary is encoded as a
Discrete-Time High-Order CBF (DHOCBF), whose constraints are incorporated into
a nonlinear optimization framework. To improve feasibility, a novel relaxation
technique is applied. The resulting framework ensure that the robot's
rigid-body motion between consecutive time steps remains collision-free,
effectively bridging discrete-time control and continuous-time safety. We show
that the proposed method handles arbitrary, including nonconvex, robot
geometries and generates collision-free, dynamically feasible trajectories in
cluttered environments. Experiments demonstrate millisecond-level solve times
and high prediction accuracy, highlighting both safety and efficiency beyond
existing CBF-based methods.

Abstract: Although humanoid and quadruped robots provide a wide range of capabilities,
current control methods, such as Deep Reinforcement Learning, focus mainly on
single skills. This approach is inefficient for solving more complicated tasks
where high-level goals, physical robot limitations and desired motion style
might all need to be taken into account. A more effective approach is to first
train a multipurpose motion policy that acquires low-level skills through
imitation, while providing latent space control over skill execution. Then,
this policy can be used to efficiently solve downstream tasks. This method has
already been successful for controlling characters in computer graphics. In
this work, we apply the approach to humanoid and quadrupedal loco-manipulation
by imitating either simple synthetic motions or kinematically retargeted dog
motions. We extend the original formulation to handle constraints, ensuring
deployment safety, and use a diffusion discriminator for better imitation
quality. We verify our methods by performing loco-manipulation in simulation
for the H1 humanoid and Solo12 quadruped, as well as deploying policies on
Solo12 hardware. Videos and code are available at

Abstract: Learning whole-body mobile manipulation via imitation is essential for
generalizing robotic skills to diverse environments and complex tasks. However,
this goal is hindered by significant challenges, particularly in effectively
processing complex observation, achieving robust generalization, and generating
coherent actions. To address these issues, we propose DSPv2, a novel policy
architecture. DSPv2 introduces an effective encoding scheme that aligns 3D
spatial features with multi-view 2D semantic features. This fusion enables the
policy to achieve broad generalization while retaining the fine-grained
perception necessary for precise control. Furthermore, we extend the Dense
Policy paradigm to the whole-body mobile manipulation domain, demonstrating its
effectiveness in generating coherent and precise actions for the whole-body
robotic platform. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly
outperforms existing approaches in both task performance and generalization
ability. Project page is available at: https://selen-suyue.github.io/DSPv2Net/.

TL;DR: 本文提出I-FailSense框架，专门用于检测语言条件机器人操作中的语义错位错误，通过后训练基础视觉语言模型和轻量级分类头实现失败检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在机器人操作中虽然提升了空间推理和任务规划能力，但缺乏识别自身失败的能力，特别是语义错位错误（机器人执行的任务语义上有意义但与指令不一致）。

Method: 从现有语言条件操作数据集构建语义错位失败检测数据集，后训练基础VLM，在不同内部层附加轻量级分类头（FS块），并通过集成机制聚合预测结果。

Result: I-FailSense在检测语义错位错误方面优于同类规模和更大规模的最先进VLM，且仅训练语义错位检测就能泛化到更广泛的机器人失败类别，并能零样本或少量后训练迁移到其他仿真环境和现实世界。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了机器人操作中的语义错位失败检测问题，具有很好的泛化能力和迁移性，相关数据集和模型已在HuggingFace公开。

Abstract: Language-conditioned robotic manipulation in open-world settings requires not
only accurate task execution but also the ability to detect failures for robust
deployment in real-world environments. Although recent advances in
vision-language models (VLMs) have significantly improved the spatial reasoning
and task-planning capabilities of robots, they remain limited in their ability
to recognize their own failures. In particular, a critical yet underexplored
challenge lies in detecting semantic misalignment errors, where the robot
executes a task that is semantically meaningful but inconsistent with the given
instruction. To address this, we propose a method for building datasets
targeting Semantic Misalignment Failures detection, from existing
language-conditioned manipulation datasets. We also present I-FailSense, an
open-source VLM framework with grounded arbitration designed specifically for
failure detection. Our approach relies on post-training a base VLM, followed by
training lightweight classification heads, called FS blocks, attached to
different internal layers of the VLM and whose predictions are aggregated using
an ensembling mechanism. Experiments show that I-FailSense outperforms
state-of-the-art VLMs, both comparable in size and larger, in detecting
semantic misalignment errors. Notably, despite being trained only on semantic
misalignment detection, I-FailSense generalizes to broader robotic failure
categories and effectively transfers to other simulation environments and
real-world with zero-shot or minimal post-training. The datasets and models are
publicly released on HuggingFace (Webpage:

Abstract: Unsteady aerodynamic effects can have a profound impact on aerial vehicle
flight performance, especially during agile maneuvers and in complex
aerodynamic environments. In this paper, we present a real-time planning and
control approach capable of reasoning about unsteady aerodynamics. Our approach
relies on a lightweight vortex particle model, parallelized to allow GPU
acceleration, and a sampling-based policy optimization strategy capable of
leveraging the vortex particle model for predictive reasoning. We demonstrate,
through both simulation and hardware experiments, that by replanning with our
unsteady aerodynamics model, we can improve the performance of aggressive
post-stall maneuvers in the presence of unsteady environmental flow
disturbances.

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用机械臂安装的微型飞行时间传感器检测和定位机器人附近物体的轻量级方法，通过建立机器人自身干扰的模型来区分外部物体和机器人自身。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机械臂安装传感器时难以区分机器人自身和外部物体的关键挑战，实现更灵活的传感器配置和更高效的机器人周围空间覆盖。

Method: 利用商用低分辨率飞行时间传感器的原始数据，建立机器人单独存在时的传感器测量经验模型，在运行时使用该模型检测机器人附近的物体。

Conclusion: 该方法在避免机器人自检测的同时实现了传感器配置的灵活性，在碰撞避免和安全人机交互方面具有应用潜力。

Abstract: We provide a method for detecting and localizing objects near a robot arm
using arm-mounted miniature time-of-flight sensors. A key challenge when using
arm-mounted sensors is differentiating between the robot itself and external
objects in sensor measurements. To address this challenge, we propose a
computationally lightweight method which utilizes the raw time-of-flight
information captured by many off-the-shelf, low-resolution time-of-flight
sensor. We build an empirical model of expected sensor measurements in the
presence of the robot alone, and use this model at runtime to detect objects in
proximity to the robot. In addition to avoiding robot self-detections in common
sensor configurations, the proposed method enables extra flexibility in sensor
placement, unlocking configurations which achieve more efficient coverage of a
radius around the robot arm. Our method can detect small objects near the arm
and localize the position of objects along the length of a robot link to
reasonable precision. We evaluate the performance of the method with respect to
object type, location, and ambient light level, and identify limiting factors
on performance inherent in the measurement principle. The proposed method has
potential applications in collision avoidance and in facilitating safe
human-robot interaction.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RE-GoT是一个创新的双层框架，结合图思维和视觉语言模型，用于自动化强化学习中的奖励函数设计，无需人工干预即可迭代优化奖励函数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计有效的奖励函数是强化学习中的主要挑战，现有基于大语言模型的方法存在幻觉、依赖人工反馈以及难以处理复杂多步任务的问题。

Method: RE-GoT首先将任务分解为文本属性图进行综合分析，生成奖励函数，然后利用视觉语言模型的视觉反馈进行迭代优化。

Result: 在10个RoboGen和4个ManiSkill2任务上的实验表明，RE-GoT平均任务成功率分别提升32.25%和达到93.73%，显著超越现有方法甚至专家设计的奖励。

Conclusion: 结合大语言模型、视觉语言模型和图思维推理为强化学习中的自主奖励演化提供了可扩展且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Designing effective reward functions remains a major challenge in
reinforcement learning (RL), often requiring considerable human expertise and
iterative refinement. Recent advances leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for
automated reward design, but these approaches are limited by hallucinations,
reliance on human feedback, and challenges with handling complex, multi-step
tasks. In this work, we introduce Reward Evolution with Graph-of-Thoughts
(RE-GoT), a novel bi-level framework that enhances LLMs with structured
graph-based reasoning and integrates Visual Language Models (VLMs) for
automated rollout evaluation. RE-GoT first decomposes tasks into
text-attributed graphs, enabling comprehensive analysis and reward function
generation, and then iteratively refines rewards using visual feedback from
VLMs without human intervention. Extensive experiments on 10 RoboGen and 4
ManiSkill2 tasks demonstrate that RE-GoT consistently outperforms existing
LLM-based baselines. On RoboGen, our method improves average task success rates
by 32.25%, with notable gains on complex multi-step tasks. On ManiSkill2,
RE-GoT achieves an average success rate of 93.73% across four diverse
manipulation tasks, significantly surpassing prior LLM-based approaches and
even exceeding expert-designed rewards. Our results indicate that combining
LLMs and VLMs with graph-of-thoughts reasoning provides a scalable and
effective solution for autonomous reward evolution in RL.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于哈密顿原理的鱼类游泳全动力学模型，能够捕捉柔性鱼体的大变形和流固耦合效应，实现自推进运动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 鱼类仿生水下机器人因其高游速和高效推进而受到关注，但需要准确、可解释且计算可行的游泳动力学模型来支持系统优化设计。

Method: 从哈密顿原理严格推导出全鱼体动力学模型，该模型能够描述柔性鱼体的连续分布弹性、大变形以及流固耦合效应，无需预设运动学参数即可实现自推进。

Result: 初步参数研究表明，游动速度和能量效率与尾摆频率呈相反趋势，且身体刚度和体长都存在最优值。

Conclusion: 这些发现为理解生物游泳机制提供了见解，并为高性能软体机器鱼的设计提供了指导。

Abstract: Fish-inspired aquatic robots are gaining increasing attention in research
communities due to their high swimming speeds and efficient propulsion enabled
by flexible bodies that generate undulatory motions. To support the design
optimizations and control of such systems, accurate, interpretable, and
computationally tractable modeling of the underlying swimming dynamics is
indispensable. In this letter, we present a full-body dynamics model for fish
swimming, rigorously derived from Hamilton's principle. The model captures the
continuously distributed elasticity of a deformable fish body undergoing large
deformations and incorporates fluid-structure coupling effects, enabling
self-propelled motion without prescribing kinematics. A preliminary parameter
study explores the influence of actuation frequency and body stiffness on
swimming speed and cost of transport (COT). Simulation results indicate that
swimming speed and energy efficiency exhibit opposing trends with tail-beat
frequency and that both body stiffness and body length have distinct optimal
values. These findings provide insights into biological swimming mechanisms and
inform the design of high-performance soft robotic swimmers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统无人机摄影需要手动选择航点和视角的局限性，这种工作流程劳动密集且性能不稳定

Method: 包含视觉语言检索管道进行初始航点选择，基于偏好的贝叶斯优化框架使用美学反馈优化姿态，以及生成安全四旋翼轨迹的运动规划器

Result: 通过仿真和硬件在环实验验证，系统能够在多样室内场景中稳健地生成专业质量的视频素材

Conclusion: 展示了具身AI代理在实现从开放词汇对话到真实世界自主空中摄影闭环方面的潜力

Abstract: We present Agentic Aerial Cinematography: From Dialogue Cues to Cinematic
Trajectories (ACDC), an autonomous drone cinematography system driven by
natural language communication between human directors and drones. The main
limitation of previous drone cinematography workflows is that they require
manual selection of waypoints and view angles based on predefined human intent,
which is labor-intensive and yields inconsistent performance. In this paper, we
propose employing large language models (LLMs) and vision foundation models
(VFMs) to convert free-form natural language prompts directly into executable
indoor UAV video tours. Specifically, our method comprises a vision-language
retrieval pipeline for initial waypoint selection, a preference-based Bayesian
optimization framework that refines poses using aesthetic feedback, and a
motion planner that generates safe quadrotor trajectories. We validate ACDC
through both simulation and hardware-in-the-loop experiments, demonstrating
that it robustly produces professional-quality footage across diverse indoor
scenes without requiring expertise in robotics or cinematography. These results
highlight the potential of embodied AI agents to close the loop from
open-vocabulary dialogue to real-world autonomous aerial cinematography.

TL;DR: 本文分析了数字工程转型中的社会技术障碍，指出单纯技术投资不足，社会因素如人员准备度、领导支持和文化对齐是关键。通过将障碍映射到美国国防部政策目标，揭示了跨维度连锁效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管有机构支持，许多数字工程转型项目表现不佳或未能实现预期效益，这源于对社会技术障碍及其相互作用理解不足。

Method: 文献综述结合社会技术系统理论，将障碍分为六个维度：人员、流程、文化、目标、基础设施和技术，并映射到美国国防部数字工程政策目标。

Result: 分析表明技术投资本身不足，失败常源于社会因素；社会技术障碍会跨维度连锁影响，使政策目标追踪和实施复杂化。

Conclusion: 管理者可将映射作为诊断工具识别风险；政策制定者需配套持续投资和长期变革管理；工程师应视数字工程为协作机会而非威胁。

Abstract: Digital Engineering (DE) transformation represents a paradigm shift in
systems engineering (SE), aiming to integrate diverse analytical models and
digital artifacts into an authoritative source of truth for improved
traceability and more efficient system lifecycle management. Despite
institutional support, many DE initiatives underperform or fail to realize
their intended benefits. We argue that this often results from a limited
understanding of the social and technical barriers, and particularly how their
interplay shapes transformation outcomes. To address this gap, we document
barriers identified in the literature and grounded in sociotechnical systems
theory, organized into six dimensions: people, processes, culture, goals,
infrastructure, and technology. We then map these barriers to the U.S.
Department of Defense's DE policy goals. Our analysis shows that technological
investments alone are insufficient, as failures frequently arise from social
factors such as workforce readiness, leadership support, and cultural
alignment. The mapping also demonstrates that sociotechnical barriers often
cascade across dimensions, making their impact on policy goals difficult to
trace and complicating implementation. These insights carry practical
implications: managers may use the mapping as a diagnostic tool to identify
risks and prioritize resources; policymakers may complement strategic mandates
with sustained investments and long-term change management; and engineers may
view DE not as a threat to job security but as an opportunity for more
effective collaboration.

Abstract: Industrial workflows demand adaptive and trustworthy assistance that can
operate under limited computing, connectivity, and strict privacy constraints.
In this work, we present MICA (Multi-Agent Industrial Coordination Assistant),
a perception-grounded and speech-interactive system that delivers real-time
guidance for assembly, troubleshooting, part queries, and maintenance. MICA
coordinates five role-specialized language agents, audited by a safety checker,
to ensure accurate and compliant support. To achieve robust step understanding,
we introduce Adaptive Step Fusion (ASF), which dynamically blends expert
reasoning with online adaptation from natural speech feedback. Furthermore, we
establish a new multi-agent coordination benchmark across representative task
categories and propose evaluation metrics tailored to industrial assistance,
enabling systematic comparison of different coordination topologies. Our
experiments demonstrate that MICA consistently improves task success,
reliability, and responsiveness over baseline structures, while remaining
deployable on practical offline hardware. Together, these contributions
highlight MICA as a step toward deployable, privacy-preserving multi-agent
assistants for dynamic factory environments. The source code will be made

Result: 该方法在较大问题实例上实现了比直接从问题输入中选择最优子集的直接预测基线更好的泛化性能。

Conclusion: 通过模仿经典算法的动态规划流程，神经算法推理器能够有效解决背包问题，并在泛化能力上优于传统方法。

Abstract: Neural algorithmic reasoning (NAR) is a growing field that aims to embed
algorithmic logic into neural networks by imitating classical algorithms. In
this extended abstract, we detail our attempt to build a neural algorithmic
reasoner that can solve Knapsack, a pseudo-polynomial problem bridging
classical algorithms and combinatorial optimisation, but omitted in standard
NAR benchmarks. Our neural algorithmic reasoner is designed to closely follow
the two-phase pipeline for the Knapsack problem, which involves first
constructing the dynamic programming table and then reconstructing the solution
from it. The approach, which models intermediate states through dynamic
programming supervision, achieves better generalization to larger problem
instances than a direct-prediction baseline that attempts to select the optimal
subset only from the problem inputs.

Conclusion: 元强化学习方案通常不够稳健，甚至可能带来重大的可靠性问题，需要进一步改进。

Abstract: The use of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) in smart
transportation networks has increased significantly in the last few years.
Among these ML and AI approaches, Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been shown to
be a very promising approach by several authors. However, a problem with using
Reinforcement Learning in Traffic Signal Control is the reliability of the
trained RL agents due to the dynamically changing distribution of the input
data with respect to the distribution of the data used for training. This
presents a major challenge and a reliability problem for the trained network of
AI agents and could have very undesirable and even detrimental consequences if
a suitable solution is not found. Several researchers have tried to address
this problem using different approaches. In particular, Meta Reinforcement
Learning (Meta RL) promises to be an effective solution. In this paper, we
evaluate and analyze a state-of-the-art Meta RL approach called MetaLight and
show that, while under certain conditions MetaLight can indeed lead to
reasonably good results, under some other conditions it might not perform well
(with errors of up to 22%), suggesting that Meta RL schemes are often not
robust enough and can even pose major reliability problems.

Result: 研究发现LLMs确实存在知识驱动幻觉问题，特别是在处理标准化业务流程时容易忽略具体证据。

Conclusion: 需要开发评估方法并提高对AI生成工件在证据驱动领域可靠性的认识。

Abstract: The utility of Large Language Models (LLMs) in analytical tasks is rooted in
their vast pre-trained knowledge, which allows them to interpret ambiguous
inputs and infer missing information. However, this same capability introduces
a critical risk of what we term knowledge-driven hallucination: a phenomenon
where the model's output contradicts explicit source evidence because it is
overridden by the model's generalized internal knowledge. This paper
investigates this phenomenon by evaluating LLMs on the task of automated
process modeling, where the goal is to generate a formal business process model
from a given source artifact. The domain of Business Process Management (BPM)
provides an ideal context for this study, as many core business processes
follow standardized patterns, making it likely that LLMs possess strong
pre-trained schemas for them. We conduct a controlled experiment designed to
create scenarios with deliberate conflict between provided evidence and the
LLM's background knowledge. We use inputs describing both standard and
deliberately atypical process structures to measure the LLM's fidelity to the
provided evidence. Our work provides a methodology for assessing this critical
reliability issue and raises awareness of the need for rigorous validation of
AI-generated artifacts in any evidence-based domain.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of neural architectures - from multilayer perceptrons to
large-scale Transformer-based models - has enabled language models (LLMs) to
exhibit emergent agentic behaviours when equipped with memory, planning, and
external tool use. However, their inherent stochasticity and multi-step
decision processes render classical evaluation methods inadequate for
diagnosing agentic performance. This work introduces a diagnostic framework for
expert systems that not only evaluates but also facilitates the transfer of
expert behaviour into LLM-powered agents. The framework integrates (i) curated
golden datasets of expert annotations, (ii) silver datasets generated through
controlled behavioural mutation, and (iii) an LLM-based Agent Judge that scores
and prescribes targeted improvements. These prescriptions are embedded into a
vectorized recommendation map, allowing expert interventions to propagate as
reusable improvement trajectories across multiple system instances. We
demonstrate the framework on a multi-agent recruiter-assistant system, showing
that it uncovers latent cognitive failures - such as biased phrasing,
extraction drift, and tool misrouting - while simultaneously steering agents
toward expert-level reasoning and style. The results establish a foundation for
standardized, reproducible expert behaviour transfer in stochastic,
tool-augmented LLM agents, moving beyond static evaluation to active expert
system refinement.

Result: 在PaRoutes、USPTO-190和天然产物数据集上实现高解决率，计算复杂度从指数级O(b^h)降低到二次O(h^2)

Conclusion: FragmentRetro作为可扩展自动化合成规划的基础组件，能够高效生成策略性起始候选物，但主要关注基于片段的解决方案而非完整反应路径

Abstract: Retrosynthesis, the process of deconstructing a target molecule into simpler
precursors, is crucial for computer-aided synthesis planning (CASP). Widely
adopted tree-search methods often suffer from exponential computational
complexity. In this work, we introduce FragmentRetro, a novel retrosynthetic
method that leverages fragmentation algorithms, specifically BRICS and r-BRICS,
combined with stock-aware exploration and pattern fingerprint screening to
achieve quadratic complexity. FragmentRetro recursively combines molecular
fragments and verifies their presence in a building block set, providing sets
of fragment combinations as retrosynthetic solutions. We present the first
formal computational analysis of retrosynthetic methods, showing that tree
search exhibits exponential complexity $O(b^h)$, DirectMultiStep scales as
$O(h^6)$, and FragmentRetro achieves $O(h^2)$, where $h$ represents the number
of heavy atoms in the target molecule and $b$ is the branching factor for tree
search. Evaluations on PaRoutes, USPTO-190, and natural products demonstrate
that FragmentRetro achieves high solved rates with competitive runtime,
including cases where tree search fails. The method benefits from fingerprint
screening, which significantly reduces substructure matching complexity. While
FragmentRetro focuses on efficiently identifying fragment-based solutions
rather than full reaction pathways, its computational advantages and ability to
generate strategic starting candidates establish it as a powerful foundational
component for scalable and automated synthesis planning.

Result: 深思熟虑对齐显著减少隐蔽行动率（OpenAI o3：13%→0.4%），但未完全消除；能够基本阻止模型追求预训练隐藏目标，但额外红队测试后仍发现不当行为；链式思维显示模型常意识到正在接受对齐评估。

Conclusion: 观察到的隐蔽行动率降低可能至少部分由情境意识驱动；随着模型推理偏离标准英语，依赖人类可读链式思维的能力下降；鼓励研究针对阴谋的对齐缓解措施及其评估，特别是本文未涉及的欺骗性对齐对抗情况。

Abstract: Highly capable AI systems could secretly pursue misaligned goals -- what we
call "scheming". Because a scheming AI would deliberately try to hide its
misaligned goals and actions, measuring and mitigating scheming requires
different strategies than are typically used in ML. We propose that assessing
anti-scheming interventions requires at least (1) testing propensity to scheme
on far out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks, (2) evaluating whether lack of scheming
is driven by situational awareness, and (3) checking for robustness to
pre-existing misaligned goals. We use a broad category of "covert actions" --
such as secretly breaking rules or intentionally underperforming in tests -- as
a proxy for scheming, and design evaluations for covert actions. We then
stress-test deliberative alignment as a case study for anti-scheming. Across 26
OOD evaluations (180+ environments), deliberative alignment reduces covert
action rates (OpenAI o3: 13%->0.4%) but does not fully eliminate them. Our
mitigation is also able to largely stop agents from pursuing a hidden goal
previously trained into the model, but we still find misbehavior after
additional red-teaming. We find that models' chain-of-thought (CoT) often
demonstrates awareness of being evaluated for alignment, and show causal
evidence that this awareness decreases covert behavior, while unawareness
increases it. Therefore, we cannot exclude that the observed reductions in
covert action rates are at least partially driven by situational awareness.
While we rely on human-legible CoT for training, studying situational
awareness, and demonstrating clear evidence of misalignment, our ability to
rely on this degrades as models continue to depart from reasoning in standard
English. We encourage research into alignment mitigations for scheming and
their assessment, especially for the adversarial case of deceptive alignment,
which this paper does not address.

Conclusion: MicroRCA-Agent通过多模态根因分析模块深度整合多模态异常信息，充分利用大语言模型能力生成包含故障组件、根因描述和推理轨迹的结构化分析结果，为微服务故障诊断提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents MicroRCA-Agent, an innovative solution for microservice
root cause analysis based on large language model agents, which constructs an
intelligent fault root cause localization system with multimodal data fusion.
The technical innovations are embodied in three key aspects: First, we combine
the pre-trained Drain log parsing algorithm with multi-level data filtering
mechanism to efficiently compress massive logs into high-quality fault
features. Second, we employ a dual anomaly detection approach that integrates
Isolation Forest unsupervised learning algorithms with status code validation
to achieve comprehensive trace anomaly identification. Third, we design a
statistical symmetry ratio filtering mechanism coupled with a two-stage LLM
analysis strategy to enable full-stack phenomenon summarization across
node-service-pod hierarchies. The multimodal root cause analysis module
leverages carefully designed cross-modal prompts to deeply integrate multimodal
anomaly information, fully exploiting the cross-modal understanding and logical
reasoning capabilities of large language models to generate structured analysis
results encompassing fault components, root cause descriptions, and reasoning
trace. Comprehensive ablation studies validate the complementary value of each
modal data and the effectiveness of the system architecture. The proposed
solution demonstrates superior performance in complex microservice fault
scenarios, achieving a final score of 50.71. The code has been released at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: C++编译错误的自动化修复面临两大挑战：缺乏大规模高质量数据集，以及传统监督方法难以生成语义正确的补丁。

Method: 提出三部分框架：1) CCrepair大规模C++编译错误数据集；2) 基于强化学习的修复方法，使用混合奖励信号关注语义质量；3) 两阶段评估系统，采用经过验证的LLM作为评判者。

Result: 实验证明RL训练的Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct模型性能与Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct相当，验证了训练范式的效率。

Conclusion: 该工作为研究社区提供了有价值的新数据集和更有效的训练评估范式，为开发更实用可靠的自动化编程助手铺平了道路。

Abstract: The automated repair of C++ compilation errors presents a significant
challenge, the resolution of which is critical for developer productivity.
Progress in this domain is constrained by two primary factors: the scarcity of
large-scale, high-fidelity datasets and the limitations of conventional
supervised methods, which often fail to generate semantically correct
patches.This paper addresses these gaps by introducing a comprehensive
framework with three core contributions. First, we present CCrepair, a novel,
large-scale C++ compilation error dataset constructed through a sophisticated
generate-and-verify pipeline. Second, we propose a Reinforcement Learning (RL)
paradigm guided by a hybrid reward signal, shifting the focus from mere
compilability to the semantic quality of the fix. Finally, we establish the
robust, two-stage evaluation system providing this signal, centered on an
LLM-as-a-Judge whose reliability has been rigorously validated against the
collective judgments of a panel of human experts. This integrated approach
aligns the training objective with generating high-quality, non-trivial patches
that are both syntactically and semantically correct. The effectiveness of our
approach was demonstrated experimentally. Our RL-trained Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct
model achieved performance comparable to a Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct model,
validating the efficiency of our training paradigm. Our work provides the
research community with a valuable new dataset and a more effective paradigm
for training and evaluating robust compilation repair models, paving the way
for more practical and reliable automated programming assistants.

Motivation: RPA在自动化规则性任务方面具有优势，但其符号性质限制了处理复杂任务的能力。机器学习概念为扩展可自动化任务范围提供了机会。

Method: 采用文献综述方法，分析RPA与机器学习的连接，并构建智能RPA的分类法。

Result: 提出了包含八个维度的智能RPA分类法：架构与生态系统、能力、数据基础、智能水平、技术集成深度、部署环境、生命周期阶段和用户-机器人关系。

Conclusion: 智能RPA分类法为理解和研究RPA与机器学习的融合提供了系统框架，有助于推动更复杂的业务流程自动化。

Abstract: Robotic process automation (RPA) is a lightweight approach to automating
business processes using software robots that emulate user actions at the
graphical user interface level. While RPA has gained popularity for its
cost-effective and timely automation of rule-based, well-structured tasks, its
symbolic nature has inherent limitations when approaching more complex tasks
currently performed by human agents. Machine learning concepts enabling
intelligent RPA provide an opportunity to broaden the range of automatable
tasks. In this paper, we conduct a literature review to explore the connections
between RPA and machine learning and organize the joint concept intelligent RPA
into a taxonomy. Our taxonomy comprises the two meta-characteristics RPA-ML
integration and RPA-ML interaction. Together, they comprise eight dimensions:
architecture and ecosystem, capabilities, data basis, intelligence level, and
technical depth of integration as well as deployment environment, lifecycle
phase, and user-robot relation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动构建职业分类法速度慢，现有自动化方法要么无法适应动态区域市场（自上而下），要么难以从噪声数据构建连贯的层次结构（自下而上）

Method: 使用全局语义聚类提炼核心职业，然后采用基于反思的多智能体系统迭代构建连贯的层次结构

Result: 在三个不同的真实数据集上，CLIMB生成的分类法比现有方法更连贯和可扩展，并成功捕捉了独特的区域特征

Conclusion: CLIMB框架能够完全自动化地创建高质量的职业分类法，解决了现有方法的局限性

Abstract: Creating robust occupation taxonomies, vital for applications ranging from
job recommendation to labor market intelligence, is challenging. Manual
curation is slow, while existing automated methods are either not adaptive to
dynamic regional markets (top-down) or struggle to build coherent hierarchies
from noisy data (bottom-up). We introduce CLIMB (CLusterIng-based Multi-agent
taxonomy Builder), a framework that fully automates the creation of
high-quality, data-driven taxonomies from raw job postings. CLIMB uses global
semantic clustering to distill core occupations, then employs a
reflection-based multi-agent system to iteratively build a coherent hierarchy.
On three diverse, real-world datasets, we show that CLIMB produces taxonomies
that are more coherent and scalable than existing methods and successfully
capture unique regional characteristics. We release our code and datasets at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业4.0环境下监控系统正从传统基于规则架构向数据驱动方法转变，需要系统比较两种方法的适用场景和特性。

Method: 通过分析两种方法各自的优势、局限性和应用场景，建立基本框架来评估关键特性，并提出混合解决方案。

Result: 基于规则系统在可解释性、确定性行为和稳定环境中表现优异，但缺乏可扩展性和适应性；数据驱动系统在异常检测和预测维护方面表现突出，但面临数据可用性和可解释性挑战。

Conclusion: 未来工业监控将采用结合专家知识和数据洞察的智能协同系统，这种双轨方法能增强韧性、运营效率和信任度。

Abstract: Industrial monitoring systems, especially when deployed in Industry 4.0
environments, are experiencing a shift in paradigm from traditional rule-based
architectures to data-driven approaches leveraging machine learning and
artificial intelligence. This study presents a comparison between these two
methodologies, analyzing their respective strengths, limitations, and
application scenarios, and proposes a basic framework to evaluate their key
properties. Rule-based systems offer high interpretability, deterministic
behavior, and ease of implementation in stable environments, making them ideal
for regulated industries and safety-critical applications. However, they face
challenges with scalability, adaptability, and performance in complex or
evolving contexts. Conversely, data-driven systems excel in detecting hidden
anomalies, enabling predictive maintenance and dynamic adaptation to new
conditions. Despite their high accuracy, these models face challenges related
to data availability, explainability, and integration complexity. The paper
suggests hybrid solutions as a possible promising direction, combining the
transparency of rule-based logic with the analytical power of machine learning.
Our hypothesis is that the future of industrial monitoring lies in intelligent,
synergic systems that leverage both expert knowledge and data-driven insights.
This dual approach enhances resilience, operational efficiency, and trust,
paving the way for smarter and more flexible industrial environments.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了通过MCP协议将LLM与医院EHR数据库连接，在真实医院环境中自主检索临床相关信息的能力，在简单任务中表现接近完美，但在复杂任务中面临挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在医学领域有应用潜力，但由于无法直接访问电子健康记录系统，在医院部署受限。Model Context Protocol（MCP）为LLM与外部工具集成提供了可能。

Method: 开发了EHR-MCP框架，将自定义MCP工具与医院EHR数据库集成，使用GPT-4.1通过LangGraph ReAct代理进行交互。测试了感染控制团队的6个任务，回顾性分析了8名患者，与医生生成的金标准进行比较。

Result: LLM能一致选择并执行正确的MCP工具，除两个任务外，所有任务都达到接近完美的准确率。在需要时间相关计算的复杂任务中表现较差。错误主要来自参数不正确或工具结果误解。

Conclusion: LLM可以通过MCP工具从EHR中检索临床数据，在简单任务中表现优异，但复杂任务仍有挑战。EHR-MCP为医院AI代理提供了安全、一致的数据访问基础架构，未来应扩展到推理、生成和临床影响评估。

Abstract: Background: Large language models (LLMs) show promise in medicine, but their
deployment in hospitals is limited by restricted access to electronic health
record (EHR) systems. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) enables integration
between LLMs and external tools.
  Objective: To evaluate whether an LLM connected to an EHR database via MCP
can autonomously retrieve clinically relevant information in a real hospital
setting.
  Methods: We developed EHR-MCP, a framework of custom MCP tools integrated
with the hospital EHR database, and used GPT-4.1 through a LangGraph ReAct
agent to interact with it. Six tasks were tested, derived from use cases of the
infection control team (ICT). Eight patients discussed at ICT conferences were
retrospectively analyzed. Agreement with physician-generated gold standards was
measured.
  Results: The LLM consistently selected and executed the correct MCP tools.
Except for two tasks, all tasks achieved near-perfect accuracy. Performance was
lower in the complex task requiring time-dependent calculations. Most errors
arose from incorrect arguments or misinterpretation of tool results. Responses
from EHR-MCP were reliable, though long and repetitive data risked exceeding
the context window.
  Conclusions: LLMs can retrieve clinical data from an EHR via MCP tools in a
real hospital setting, achieving near-perfect performance in simple tasks while
highlighting challenges in complex ones. EHR-MCP provides an infrastructure for
secure, consistent data access and may serve as a foundation for hospital AI
agents. Future work should extend beyond retrieval to reasoning, generation,
and clinical impact assessment, paving the way for effective integration of
generative AI into clinical practice.

Motivation: 当前文本到图像生成系统在准确捕捉自然语言提示中的空间关系方面存在主要挑战，需要解决这一关键限制。

Method: 采用轻量级方法，通过微调的语言模型自动将提示转换为基于元组的结构化信息，并无缝集成到T2I生成流程中。

Result: 实验结果显示空间准确性显著提升，同时整体图像质量（通过Inception Score衡量）未受影响，自动生成的元组质量与人工制作的相当。

Conclusion: 这种结构化信息为增强T2I生成中的空间关系提供了实用且可移植的解决方案，解决了当前大规模生成系统的关键限制。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generation has advanced rapidly, yet faithfully capturing
spatial relationships described in natural language prompts remains a major
challenge. Prior efforts have addressed this issue through prompt optimization,
spatially grounded generation, and semantic refinement. This work introduces a
lightweight approach that augments prompts with tuple-based structured
information, using a fine-tuned language model for automatic conversion and
seamless integration into T2I pipelines. Experimental results demonstrate
substantial improvements in spatial accuracy, without compromising overall
image quality as measured by Inception Score. Furthermore, the automatically
generated tuples exhibit quality comparable to human-crafted tuples. This
structured information provides a practical and portable solution to enhance
spatial relationships in T2I generation, addressing a key limitation of current
large-scale generative systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出ASAC（基于注意力模式的注意力控制）方法，将认知科学中的注意力模式理论融入人工神经网络，通过VQVAE作为注意力抽象器和控制器，在视觉和NLP任务中提升分类准确性和学习效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受认知科学中注意力模式理论（AST）的启发，该理论认为人类通过创建注意力模型来管理注意力分配。作者旨在将这一认知机制引入AI系统，以优化注意力机制的使用效率。

Method: 在Transformer架构中嵌入ASAC模块，使用向量量化变分自编码器（VQVAE）作为注意力抽象器和控制器，显式建模注意力分配过程。

Result: 实验表明ASAC在视觉和NLP任务中均能提升分类准确性、加速学习过程，并展现出对噪声数据、分布外数据和对抗攻击的鲁棒性，在多任务设置中也表现优异。

Conclusion: ASAC成功建立了认知科学与机器学习之间的联系，为AI系统中注意力机制的高效利用提供了新思路，在多个领域展现出显著性能提升和泛化能力。

Abstract: Attention mechanisms have become integral in AI, significantly enhancing
model performance and scalability by drawing inspiration from human cognition.
Concurrently, the Attention Schema Theory (AST) in cognitive science posits
that individuals manage their attention by creating a model of the attention
itself, effectively allocating cognitive resources. Inspired by AST, we
introduce ASAC (Attention Schema-based Attention Control), which integrates the
attention schema concept into artificial neural networks. Our initial
experiments focused on embedding the ASAC module within transformer
architectures. This module employs a Vector-Quantized Variational AutoEncoder
(VQVAE) as both an attention abstractor and controller, facilitating precise
attention management. By explicitly modeling attention allocation, our approach
aims to enhance system efficiency. We demonstrate ASAC's effectiveness in both
the vision and NLP domains, highlighting its ability to improve classification
accuracy and expedite the learning process. Our experiments with vision
transformers across various datasets illustrate that the attention controller
not only boosts classification accuracy but also accelerates learning.
Furthermore, we have demonstrated the model's robustness and generalization
capabilities across noisy and out-of-distribution datasets. In addition, we
have showcased improved performance in multi-task settings. Quick experiments
reveal that the attention schema-based module enhances resilience to
adversarial attacks, optimizes attention to improve learning efficiency, and
facilitates effective transfer learning and learning from fewer examples. These
promising results establish a connection between cognitive science and machine
learning, shedding light on the efficient utilization of attention mechanisms
in AI systems.

TL;DR: 本研究通过分析不列颠哥伦比亚省（2012-2019年）发薪日贷款数据，发现降低利率上限会显著增加贷款需求，为消费者带来可观的福利收益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究利率上限政策对发薪日贷款需求的影响，为政策制定提供实证依据。

Method: 使用不列颠哥伦比亚省2012-2019年的汇总数据，通过OLS估计线性需求函数，分析利率上限从每100加元23加元降至17加元再至15加元的影响。

Result: 降低利率上限显著增加了贷款需求，从23加元降至15加元的8加元降幅使年消费者剩余增加约2860万加元（2012年加元）。

Conclusion: 更严格的利率上限政策可以带来显著的消费者福利收益，预计2025年进一步降至14加元将每年再增加390万加元收益。

Abstract: This study examines how interest rate caps affect the demand for payday
loans, using aggregate data from British Columbia (2012--2019) during which the
province's maximum fee was reduced from \$23 to \$17 and then to \$15 per \$100
borrowed. Estimating a linear demand function via OLS, we find that lowering
interest rate caps significantly increases loan demand. We estimate that the
\$8 decrease, from \$23 to \$15 per \$100, raised annual consumer surplus by
roughly \$28.6 million (2012 CAD). A further reduction to \$14, starting in
January 2025, would add another \$3.9 million per year. These results suggest
that stricter interest rate caps can yield substantial consumer welfare gains.

Motivation: 生成式AI正在改变工作流程、任务构成和组织设计，但其对就业和宏观经济的整体影响尚不明确。本文旨在系统梳理现有理论和实证证据，填补研究空白。

Method: 采用三层次分析方法：1）从宏观生产框架到任务和专业知识模型的演变；2）定量比较多个研究的职业AI暴露度测量；3）整合RCT实验、实地实验和数字追踪数据的实证证据。

Result: 生产力提升幅度在RCT中为20-60%，实地实验中为15-30%。新员工在简单任务中获益更大，复杂任务中高低技能员工获益情况不一。数字追踪显示写作和翻译领域存在人机替代，AI需求上升，新员工需求有所下降。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了AI影响的复杂性，指出当前研究存在对简单任务的过度关注、LLM多样性不足、技术中心主义的AI暴露度测量等局限，需要更多关注采用动态和暴露度是否转化为实际替代或生产力提升的研究。

Abstract: Generative AI is altering work processes, task composition, and
organizational design, yet its effects on employment and the macroeconomy
remain unresolved. In this review, we synthesize theory and empirical evidence
at three levels. First, we trace the evolution from aggregate production
frameworks to task- and expertise-based models. Second, we quantitatively
review and compare (ex-ante) AI exposure measures of occupations from multiple
studies and find convergence towards high-wage jobs. Third, we assemble ex-post
evidence of AI's impact on employment from randomized controlled trials (RCTs),
field experiments, and digital trace data (e.g., online labor platforms,
software repositories), complemented by partial coverage of surveys. Across the
reviewed studies, productivity gains are sizable but context-dependent: on the
order of 20 to 60 percent in controlled RCTs, and 15 to 30 percent in field
experiments. Novice workers tend to benefit more from LLMs in simple tasks.
Across complex tasks, evidence is mixed on whether low or high-skilled workers
benefit more. Digital trace data show substitution between humans and machines
in writing and translation alongside rising demand for AI, with mild evidence
of declining demand for novice workers. A more substantial decrease in demand
for novice jobs across AI complementary work emerges from recent studies using
surveys, platform payment records, or administrative data. Research gaps
include the focus on simple tasks in experiments, the limited diversity of LLMs
studied, and technology-centric AI exposure measures that overlook adoption
dynamics and whether exposure translates into substitution, productivity gains,
erode or increase expertise.

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: 研究分析了德国1500万辆电动汽车的不同充电策略对电力系统的影响，发现即使只有不到30%的车辆采用双向充电（V2G），系统成本也比完全智能充电更低。当V2G比例达到50%时，成本甚至低于没有电动汽车的系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电动汽车在交通部门脱碳中发挥关键作用，但其对电力部门的影响很大程度上取决于充电策略。研究旨在系统分析不同充电策略对电力系统的影响。

Method: 使用容量扩展模型，分析1500万辆电动汽车在德国的三种充电策略组合：刚性充电、智能充电和双向充电（V2G）。

Result: 研究发现，V2G的灵活性效应能够抵消整个电动汽车车队的电力需求效应。V2G车主获得了大部分成本节约收益，但随着V2G比例增加，收益会更多溢出给其他电力消费者。

Conclusion: 政策制定者应重点关注实现适度的V2G车队比例，而不是让每辆车都实现智能充电。

Abstract: While battery electric vehicles (BEVs) play a key role for decarbonizing the
transport sector, their impact on the power sector heavily depends on their
charging strategies. Here we systematically analyze various combinations
between inflexible, smart and bidirectional (or vehicle-to-grid, V2G) charging
of 15 million electric cars in Germany. Using a capacity expansion model, we
find that even a moderate share of bidirectional charging below 30% leads to
lower system costs than a fully smartly charging BEV fleet. At a V2G share of
50%, costs are even lower than in a system without any BEVs. This means that
the flexibility effect of half of the BEV fleet charging bidirectionally
outweighs the demand effect of the whole BEV fleet. We show how costs savings
are driven by the ability of V2G to serve demand, especially during hours with
high residual load. We also explore the distributional effects of respective
electricity price changes. While V2G car owners internalize a substantial share
of overall cost savings, the benefits increasingly spill over to other
electricity consumers as the share of bidirectional charging grows. We conclude
that policymakers should focus on enabling a moderate fleet share of V2G rather
than on enabling every car to charge smartly.

Conclusion: 贫困对选举诚信的影响是复杂的，存在两种相反的力量作用，这一发现对理解选举制度和政策设计具有重要意义。

Abstract: We propose two opposing forces that impact the relation between electoral
integrity and poverty. On the one hand, it is more costly to provide electoral
integrity in states where there is more poverty due to transaction costs and
opportunity costs. On the other hand, extreme levels of poverty attract media
scrutiny and greater external monitoring of electoral integrity, giving rise to
more demand for electoral integrity. Taken together, we expect electoral
integrity to be a U-shaped function of poverty. We also hypothesize that
electoral integrity will vary depending on the strength of state electoral
laws. Expert-level survey data on electoral integrity from the 2016 U.S.
Presidential election and the 2018 U.S. congressional election, in combination
with U.S. state-level data on poverty are strongly consistent with these
predictions.

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型（LLM）对劳动力市场的短期影响，发现高暴露职业的工人在ChatGPT推出后收入增加，而失业率保持不变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着ChatGPT的发布，大型语言模型迅速普及，引发了关于生产力提升和就业替代的讨论。本文旨在实证检验LLM对劳动力市场的实际影响。

Method: 采用合成双重差分法（Synthetic Difference in Differences），比较不同LLM暴露水平职业的收入和失业率变化。

Result: 高暴露职业的工人收入增加，但失业率没有显著变化。

Conclusion: LLM对劳动力市场的初始调整主要通过收入渠道而非工人重新配置实现。

Abstract: Large Language Models have spread rapidly since the release of ChatGPT in
late 2022, accompanied by claims of major productivity gains but also concerns
about job displacement. This paper examines the short-run labor market effects
of LLM adoption by comparing earnings and unemployment across occupations with
differing levels of exposure to these technologies. Using a Synthetic
Difference in Differences approach, we estimate the impact of LLM exposure on
earnings and unemployment. Our findings show that workers in highly exposed
occupations experienced earnings increases following ChatGPT's introduction,
while unemployment rates remained unchanged. These results suggest that initial
labor market adjustments to LLMs operate primarily through earnings rather than
worker reallocation.

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: 本研究使用全球AI内容影响数据集（2020-2025）调查AI采用对失业率的影响，发现在零售业中更高的AI采用率与更低的失业率相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究人工智能采用对劳动力市场的实际影响，为政策制定提供实证依据。

Method: 采用三阶段普通最小二乘法（OLS）框架，分析200个行业-国家-年份观察数据，涵盖澳大利亚、中国、法国、日本和英国的十个行业。

Result: 全样本回归未发现AI采用率与失业率之间的显著线性关联，但零售业的交互效应显著（-0.138，p<0.05），表明在零售业中更高的AI采用与更低的失业率相关。

Conclusion: 研究结果扩展了AI对劳动力市场影响的实证证据，强调了AI在零售业的生产力提升作用，支持有针对性的政策干预。

Abstract: This study investigates the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) adoption
on job loss rates using the Global AI Content Impact Dataset (2020--2025). The
panel comprises 200 industry-country-year observations across Australia, China,
France, Japan, and the United Kingdom in ten industries. A three-stage ordinary
least squares (OLS) framework is applied. First, a full-sample regression finds
no significant linear association between AI adoption rate and job loss rate
($\beta \approx -0.0026$, $p = 0.949$). Second, industry-specific regressions
identify the marketing and retail sectors as closest to significance. Third,
interaction-term models quantify marginal effects in those two sectors,
revealing a significant retail interaction effect ($-0.138$, $p < 0.05$),
showing that higher AI adoption is linked to lower job loss in retail. These
findings extend empirical evidence on AI's labor market impact, emphasize AI's
productivity-enhancing role in retail, and support targeted policy measures
such as intelligent replenishment systems and cashierless checkout
implementations.

<details>

Motivation: 在聚类随机对照试验中，依从性可能同时发生在患者和聚类层面，现有的依从者平均因果效应方法无法充分处理聚类层面的连续依从性度量

Method: 贝叶斯模型，基于预处理特征、部分依从状态和个体结果将聚类分类到潜在依从性层中，并对对照组中未观察到的依从性进行插补

Result: 该方法能够估计在聚类和个体层面依从性定义的层内的有限和超总体估计量

Conclusion: 该方法为处理多层面依从性的聚类随机试验提供了有效的分析框架，并在METRIcAL试验中得到应用

Abstract: In pragmatic cluster randomized controlled trials (PCRCTs), the unit of
randomization may be the healthcare provider. In these studies, noncompliance
can occur at both the patient and cluster levels. Some studies measure
cluster-level implementation using multiple continuous metrics while
documenting individual binary compliance. The complier average causal effect
estimates the intervention effects among individuals that comply with the
assigned intervention. However, it does not account for compliance metrics at
the cluster level. When compliance with the intervention is influenced by both
providers and individuals, it can be scientifically beneficial to describe the
effects of the intervention between all levels of compliance. We propose a
Bayesian method for PCRCTs with one-sided binary noncompliance at the
individual level and one-sided partial compliance at the cluster level. Our
Bayesian model classifies clusters into latent compliance strata based on
pretreatment characteristics, partial compliance status, and individual
outcomes. Because compliance is only observed in the treatment arm, the method
imputes unobserved compliance for control clusters and the individuals within
them. This approach estimates finite and super-population estimands within
strata defined by both cluster- and individual-level compliance. We apply this
method to the METRIcAL trial, a multi-part, pragmatic cluster randomized trial
evaluating the effects of a personalized music intervention on agitation in
nursing home residents with dementia.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的单指数集成物种分布模型（ISDM），用于整合多个渔业调查数据，通过单一潜在指数表示真实物种分布，并包含调查特定的捕获效率函数，以克服传统ISDM的过拟合问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在渔业生态学中，物种丰度数据通常来自多个具有不同特征的调查。传统集成物种分布模型虽然灵活但容易过拟合，影响环境效应的解释性和预测性能。

Method: 构建基于单一潜在指数（包含空间随机效应）的单指数ISDM，该指数代表真实物种分布，并通过调查特定的捕获效率函数将单一指数映射到各调查的预期捕获量。

Result: 单指数ISDM能够更清晰地解释环境效应和调查捕获效率差异，并可能获得比现有ISDM更好的预测性能。

Conclusion: 单指数ISDM为解决多调查数据集成建模中的过拟合问题提供了有效方法，提高了模型的可解释性和预测准确性。

Abstract: In fisheries ecology, species abundance data are often collected by multiple
surveys, each with unique characteristics. This article focuses on Atlantic sea
scallop abundance data along the northeast coast of the United States,
collected from two bottom trawl surveys which cover a larger spatial domain but
have low catch efficiency, and a dredge survey which is more efficient but
limited to domains where the species are believed to be present. To model such
data, integrated species distribution models (ISDMs) have been proposed to
incorporate information from multiple surveys, by including common
environmental effects along with correlated survey-specific spatial fields.
However, while flexible, these ISDMs can be susceptible to overfitting, which
can complicate interpretability of the shared environmental effects and
potentially lead to poor predictive performance. To overcome these drawbacks,
we introduce a novel single index ISDM, built from a single index (with spatial
random effects) that represents a latent measure of the true species
distribution, and survey-specific catch efficiency functions which map the
single index to the survey-specific expected catch. Our results show that the
single index ISDM offers more meaningful interpretations of the environmental
effects and survey catch efficiency differences, while potentially achieving
better predictive performance than existing ISDMs.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于自适应内部模型原理（IMP）的系统，用于模拟弱电鱼在移动避难所中的非线性跟踪行为。该系统通过自适应状态估计器识别未知频率，并将其用于闭环控制，证明了跟踪误差能够指数收敛到理想控制系统的水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 弱电鱼在跟踪移动避难所时表现出非线性行为：低频时跟踪近乎完美，但高频时相位滞后增加、增益降低。本文旨在建立理论模型来解释这种非线性跟踪行为。

Method: 采用自适应内部模型原理（IMP）系统，包含自适应状态估计器来识别未知频率，并将其输入到基于轻阻尼谐波振荡器的闭环IMP系统中。

Result: 理论证明显示，使用在线自适应频率估计的IMP系统的跟踪误差能够指数收敛到具有完美刺激信息的理想控制系统水平。仿真结果进一步表明，该模型能够复现鱼在宽频率范围内的避难所跟踪Bode图。

Conclusion: 研究结果确立了将IMP与自适应识别过程相结合的理论有效性，为自适应感觉运动控制提供了一个基本框架。

Abstract: The weakly electric fish \emph{Eigenmannia virescens} naturally swims back
and forth to stay within a moving refuge, tracking its motion using visual and
electrosensory feedback. Previous experiments show that when the refuge
oscillates as a low-frequency sinusoid (below about 0.5 Hz), the tracking is
nearly perfect, but phase lag increases and gain decreases at higher
frequencies. Here, we model this nonlinear behavior as an adaptive internal
model principle (IMP) system. Specifically, an adaptive state estimator
identifies the \emph{a priori} unknown frequency, and feeds this parameter
estimate into a closed-loop IMP-based system built around a lightly damped
harmonic oscillator. We prove that the closed-loop tracking error of the
IMP-based system, where the online adaptive frequency estimate is used as a
surrogate for the unknown frequency, converges exponentially to that of an
ideal control system with perfect information about the stimulus. Simulations
further show that our model reproduces the fish refuge tracking Bode plot
across a wide frequency range. These results establish the theoretical validity
of combining the IMP with an adaptive identification process and provide a
basic framework in adaptive sensorimotor control.

TL;DR: 本文提出将容量限制合同和再调度合同协调作为风险感知资源分配问题，通过机会约束两阶段随机混合整数规划模型，在电动汽车充电和再调度市场不确定性下优化两种工具的协调使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 协调两种拥堵管理工具（容量限制合同和再调度合同），将其优势和劣势表示为运营风险特征，通过协调实现风险平衡。

Method: 开发机会约束两阶段随机混合整数规划模型，系统运营商从管理电动汽车车队的聚合商处采购灵活性，模型捕捉电动汽车充电和再调度市场条件的不确定性，使用荷兰再调度市场的真实订单簿数据。

Result: 结合两种合同通常是最具成本效益的风险缓解方法，但最优组合取决于车队规模和再调度激活时机。大型车队（如25,000辆）的最优策略会限制再调度使用，以避免不成熟再调度市场的流动性风险。

Conclusion: 各种不确定性来源会影响拥堵管理工具之间的最优权衡，再调度激活时间越晚，由于交易窗口缩小，流动性风险越大。

Abstract: This paper presents the coordination of two congestion management instruments
- capacity limitation contracts (CLCs) and redispatch contracts (RCs) - as a
risk-aware resource allocation problem. We propose that the advantages and
drawbacks of these instruments can be represented as operational risk profiles
and can be balanced through coordination. To this end, we develop a
chance-constrained two-stage stochastic mixed-integer program for a system
operator procuring flexibility from an aggregator managing a fleet of electric
vehicles (EVs). The model captures uncertainty in EV charging and redispatch
market conditions, using real order book data from the Dutch redispatch market
(GOPACS).
  Results indicate that combining CLCs and RCs is generally the most
cost-effective approach to mitigate risks associated with each instrument, but
the optimal mix depends on fleet size and RC activation timing. Large
uncertainty about EV loading increases RC activation intraday to correct for
forecasting errors at the earlier CLC stage. For large fleet sizes (e.g.
25.000) the optimal policy limits redispatch due to market liquidity risks in
the immature redispatch market. This risk increases for later redispatch
activation due to shrinking trading windows for redispatch products. These
findings highlight how various sources of uncertainty can impact the optimal
trade-off between congestion management instruments.

Method: 采用逆源公式，利用辐射算子的零空间，将未知元素激励表示为最小范数项（辐射项）和合适的非辐射分量的线性组合。前者通过截断奇异值分解生成满足模式掩模的远场功率模式，后者属于辐射算子的零空间，用于满足几何和电气约束。

Result: 通过多个数值示例验证了该方法在各种阵列配置和附加设计目标下的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为相控阵天线设计提供了一种灵活有效的综合方法，能够同时处理功率模式要求和几何/电气约束。

Abstract: A versatile approach for the synthesis of phased array (PA) antennas able to
fit user-defined power pattern masks, while fulfilling additional geometrical
and/or electrical constraints on the geometry of the array aperture and/or on
the array excitations is presented. Such a synthesis method is based on the
inverse source (IS) formulation and exploits the null-space of the radiation
operator that causes the non-uniqueness of the IS problem at hand. More in
detail, the unknown element excitations of the PA are expressed as the linear
combination of a minimum-norm or radiating (RA) term and a suitable
non-radiating (NR) component. The former, computed via the truncated singular
value decomposition (SVD) of the array radiation operator, is devoted to
generate a far-field power pattern that fulfills user-defined pattern masks.
The other one belongs to the null-space of the radiation operator and allows
one to fit additional geometrical and/or electrical constraints on the geometry
of the array aperture and/or on the beam-forming network (BFN) when determined
with a customized global optimization strategy. A set of numerical examples,
concerned with various array arrangements and additional design targets, is
reported to prove the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Conclusion: 所提出的框架成功整合了建模、优化和传感器控制，为重型机器人操纵器提供了高效且安全的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a unified framework that integrates modeling,
optimization, and sensorless control of an all-electric heavy-duty robotic
manipulator (HDRM) driven by electromechanical linear actuators (EMLAs). An
EMLA model is formulated to capture motor electromechanics and
direction-dependent transmission efficiencies, while a mathematical model of
the HDRM, incorporating both kinematics and dynamics, is established to
generate joint-space motion profiles for prescribed TCP trajectories. A
safety-ensured trajectory generator, tailored to this model, maps Cartesian
goals to joint space while enforcing joint-limit and velocity margins. Based on
the resulting force and velocity demands, a multi-objective Non-dominated
Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) is employed to select the optimal EMLA
configuration. To accelerate this optimization, a deep neural network, trained
with EMLA parameters, is embedded in the optimization process to predict
steady-state actuator efficiency from trajectory profiles. For the chosen EMLA
design, a physics-informed Kriging surrogate, anchored to the analytic model
and refined with experimental data, learns residuals of EMLA outputs to support
force and velocity sensorless control. The actuator model is further embedded
in a hierarchical virtual decomposition control (VDC) framework that outputs
voltage commands. Experimental validation on a one-degree-of-freedom EMLA
testbed confirms accurate trajectory tracking and effective sensorless control
under varying loads.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决端到端学习方法样本效率低、可靠性有限的问题，以及基于模型方法依赖预定义参考且泛化能力差的问题。

Method: 分层框架：高层策略通过强化学习进行战术决策选择抽象目标，底层通过模型预测控制确保动态可行性和安全性。

Result: 在捕食者-猎物基准测试中，该方法在奖励、安全性和一致性方面优于端到端和基于屏蔽的强化学习基线。

Conclusion: 将结构化学习与基于模型的控制相结合具有显著优势，能够实现更安全、更协调的多智能体行为。

Abstract: Achieving safe and coordinated behavior in dynamic, constraint-rich
environments remains a major challenge for learning-based control. Pure
end-to-end learning often suffers from poor sample efficiency and limited
reliability, while model-based methods depend on predefined references and
struggle to generalize. We propose a hierarchical framework that combines
tactical decision-making via reinforcement learning (RL) with low-level
execution through Model Predictive Control (MPC). For the case of multi-agent
systems this means that high-level policies select abstract targets from
structured regions of interest (ROIs), while MPC ensures dynamically feasible
and safe motion. Tested on a predator-prey benchmark, our approach outperforms
end-to-end and shielding-based RL baselines in terms of reward, safety, and
consistency, underscoring the benefits of combining structured learning with
model-based control.

simultaneous sensor transmissions and analyze their performance gaps relative
to the optimal strategy. Simulations demonstrate that our algorithms
effectively balance efficiency and fairness in both cases.

Conclusion: 提出的精确不确定性模型能够安全地提升ANC耳机性能，为不同佩戴情况下的噪声控制提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Active noise control (ANC) has become popular for reducing noise and thus
enhancing user comfort in headphones. While feedback control offers an
effective way to implement ANC, it is restricted by uncertainty of the
controlled system that arises, e.g., from differing wearing situations. Widely
used unstructured models which capture these variations tend to overestimate
the uncertainty and thus restrict ANC performance. As a remedy, this work
explores uncertainty models that provide a more accurate fit to the observed
variations in order to improve ANC performance for over-ear and in-ear
headphones. We describe the controller optimization based on these models and
implement an ANC prototype to compare the performances associated with
conventional and proposed modeling approaches. Extensive measurements with
human wearers confirm the robustness and indicate a performance improvement
over conventional methods. The results allow to safely increase the active
attenuation of ANC headphones by several decibels.

Abstract: Boolean networks (BNs) are important models for gene regulatory networks and
many other biological systems. In this paper, we study the minimal
controllability problem of threshold and XOR BNs with degree constraints.
Firstly, we derive lower-bound-related inequalities and some upper bounds for
the number of control nodes of several classes of controllable majority-type
threshold BNs. Secondly, we construct controllable majority-type BNs and BNs
involving Boolean threshold functions with both positive and negative
coefficients such that these BNs are associated with a small number of control
nodes. Thirdly, we derive a linear-algebraic necessary and sufficient condition
for the controllability of general XOR-BNs, whose update rules are based on the
XOR logical operator, and construct polynomial-time algorithms for computing
control-node sets and control signals for general XOR-BNs. Lastly, we use ring
theory and linear algebra to establish a few best-case upper bounds for a type
of degree-constrainted XOR-BNs called $k$-$k$-XOR-BNs. In particular, we show
that for any positive integer $m \geq 2$ and any odd integer $k \in [3, 2^{m} -
1]$, there exists a $2^{m}$-node controllable $k$-$k$-XOR-BN with 1 control
node. Our results offer theoretical insights into minimal interventions in

policy, thus providing good transient performance. The efficiency of our
approach is also demonstrated through extensive simulations.

Conclusion: 该框架为L-PBF中的热管理提供了实用且计算高效的解决方案，为实现L-PBF的闭环控制铺平了道路。

Abstract: Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF) is a widely adopted additive manufacturing
process for fabricating complex metallic parts layer by layer. Effective
thermal management is essential to ensure part quality and structural
integrity, as thermal gradients and residual stresses can lead to defects such
as warping and cracking. However, existing experimental or computational
techniques lack the ability to forecast future temperature distributions in
real time, an essential capability for proactive process control. This paper
presents a real-time thermal state forecasting framework for L-PBF, based on a
physics-informed reduced-order thermal model integrated with a Kalman filtering
scheme. The proposed approach efficiently captures inter-layer heat transfer
dynamics and enables accurate tracking and forecasting of spatial and temporal
temperature evolution. Validation across multiple part geometries using
measured data demonstrates that the method reliably estimates and forecasts
peak temperatures and cooling trends. By enabling predictive thermal control,
this framework offers a practical and computationally efficient solution for
thermal management in L-PBF, paving the way toward closed-loop control in
L-PBF.

Motivation: 电动汽车的普及带来了电力系统的灵活性潜力，但无序或同步充电可能导致配电网过载，需要协调充电调度以确保电网安全。

Method: 利用广义多面体表示电动汽车群体的聚合灵活性，将网络约束集成到这种表示中，优化网络约束下的聚合灵活性集，并提出分解程序将聚合负荷分布映射到个体电动汽车调度指令。

Result: 开发了能够同时满足设备级和网络约束的电动汽车充电协调框架，有效避免了配电网过载问题。

Conclusion: 该方法成功地将网络约束集成到电动汽车聚合灵活性表示中，为大规模电动汽车接入电网提供了有效的协调充电解决方案。

Abstract: The increasing penetration of electric vehicles (EVs) introduces significant
flexibility potential to power systems. However, uncoordinated or synchronous
charging can lead to overloading of distribution networks. Extending recent
approaches that utilize generalized polymatroids, a family of polytopes, to
represent the aggregate flexibility of EV populations, we show how to integrate
network constraints into this representation to obtain network-constrained
aggregate flexibility sets. Furthermore, we demonstrate how to optimize over
these network-constrained aggregate flexibility sets, and propose a
disaggregation procedure that maps an aggregate load profile to individual EV
dispatch instructions, while respecting both device-level and network
constraints.

Conclusion: PoliTok-DE为计算社会科学提供了宝贵的多模态数据资源，特别适用于研究选举相关的社交媒体动态和平台内容管理政策。

Abstract: We present PoliTok-DE, a large-scale multimodal dataset (video, audio,
images, text) of TikTok posts related to the 2024 Saxony state election in
Germany. The corpus contains over 195,000 posts published between 01.07.2024
and 30.11.2024, of which over 18,000 (17.3%) were subsequently deleted from the
platform. Posts were identified via the TikTok research API and complemented
with web scraping to retrieve full multimodal media and metadata. PoliTok-DE
supports computational social science across substantive and methodological
agendas: substantive work on intolerance and political communication;
methodological work on platform policies around deleted content and
qualitative-quantitative multimodal research. To illustrate one possible
analysis, we report a case study on the co-occurrence of intolerance and
entertainment using an annotated subset. The dataset of post IDs is publicly
available on Hugging Face, and full content can be hydrated with our provided
code. Access to the deleted content is restricted, and can be requested for
research purposes.

### [86] [Fact-Finding in Social Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15454)
*Boris Ginzburg*

Main category: econ.TH

TL;DR: 本文研究了选民通过社交网络分享信息对政治认知的影响，发现网络连通性提高会增加对简单事实的了解，但会减少对复杂问题的了解，而极化现象会降低整体认知水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究选民如何通过社交网络获取和分享信息，以及这种信息传播如何影响他们对政治事实的认知程度。

Method: 建立模型分析选民投入努力判断政治主张正确性，并通过社交网络分享信息的过程。

Result: 网络连通性增加使选民对基本事实更了解，但对复杂问题了解更少；政治极化会降低整体认知水平。

Conclusion: 社交网络的信息传播对选民认知有复杂影响，需要平衡连通性和信息质量，同时警惕极化对民主决策的负面影响。

Abstract: This paper models voters who invest effort to determine whether a particular
claim relevant to their voting choices is correct. If a voter succeeds in
determining whether the claim is correct, this information is shared via a
social network. I show that increased connectivity makes voters more informed
about basic facts, but less informed about complicated issues. At the same
time, polarization makes voters less informed overall.

### [87] [Misspecified learning and evolutionary stability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16067)
*Kevin He,Jonathan Libgober*

Main category: econ.TH

TL;DR: 本文扩展了间接进化方法，研究模型（可能错误设定）的选择问题。代理使用不同模型进行配对博弈，模型定义了关于博弈参数和他人策略的可行信念。在均衡中，每个代理采用最适合其数据的可行信念，并根据信念最优行动。我们通过比较居民模型与入侵模型的均衡收益来定义稳定性，并提供了正确设定的居民模型只能被包含多个可行信念的错误设定入侵模型所破坏的条件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在进化框架下，代理如何选择可能错误设定的模型，以及正确设定的模型在何种条件下会被错误设定的模型所取代。

Method: 扩展间接进化方法，定义代理匹配博弈的框架，其中模型定义了可行信念集合。在均衡中，代理选择最适合数据的信念并最优行动。通过比较居民模型与入侵模型的收益来定义稳定性。

Result: 正确设定的居民模型只能被包含多个可行信念的错误设定入侵模型所破坏。入侵模型只有在人口规模较大时才能在对抗居民模型时表现良好，这是由于错误设定信念的内生性所致。

Conclusion: 在Cournot双寡头和蜈蚣博弈的应用中，展示了需求弹性误判和类比推理的出现，表明错误设定的模型在某些条件下可能优于正确设定的模型。

Abstract: We extend the indirect evolutionary approach to the selection of (possibly
misspecified) models. Agents with different models match in pairs to play a
stage game, where models define feasible beliefs about game parameters and
about others' strategies. In equilibrium, each agent adopts the feasible belief
that best fits their data and plays optimally given their beliefs. We define
the stability of the resident model by comparing its equilibrium payoff with
that of the entrant model, and provide conditions under which the correctly
specified resident model can only be destabilized by misspecified entrant
models that contain multiple feasible beliefs (that is, entrant models that
permit inference). We also show that entrants may do well in their matches
against the residents only when the entrant population is large, due to the
endogeneity of misspecified beliefs. Applications include the selection of
demand-elasticity misperception in Cournot duopoly and the emergence of
analogy-based reasoning in centipede games.

*Delia Coculescu,Maximilian Janisch,Thomas Lehéricy*

Main category: econ.TH

TL;DR: 该论文构建了一个关于专利药物市场、保险公司和消费者决策的博弈模型，分析保险对药物价格和治疗可及性的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究生命拯救药物的医药市场如何结合垄断力量和保险覆盖，理解保险进入对药物价格和治疗可及性的复杂影响。

Method: 构建了一个可处理的序贯博弈模型，包括专利持有者定价、保险公司设定保费、异质消费者投保和治疗决策，使用主观疾病概率和保留价格两个充分统计量来捕捉异质性。

Result: 证明子博弈完美纳什均衡存在，保险进入严格提高生产者利润，但对药物价格和治疗可及性的影响取决于人口统计量的联合分布，可能提高或降低两者。

Conclusion: 结果为评估高价药物市场的价格谈判、价格上限和补贴方案提供了基准，揭示了保险可能减少治疗可及性的条件。

Abstract: Pharmaceutical markets for life-saving therapies combine monopoly power with
insurance coverage. We build a tractable sequential game in which a
patent-holder chooses the drug price, a profit-maximising insurer sets its
premium, and a population of heterogeneous agents decide whether to insure and,
conditional on diagnosis, whether to purchase treatment. Two sufficient
statistics - subjective illness probability and reservation price - capture
heterogeneity and nest risk-aversion and liquidity-constraint motives within a
unified framework. We prove existence of subgame-perfect Nash equilibria and
show that entry of an insurer strictly raises producer profits but may raise or
lower both drug prices and treatment uptake, depending on the joint
distribution of the population statistics. Numerical experiments calibrated to
flexible parametric families illustrate non-monotone comparative statics and
quantify conditions under which insurance reduces access. Our results provide
benchmarks for evaluating price negotiations, price caps, and subsidy schemes
in high-cost drug markets.

Method: 提出通用框架，利用元宇宙服务作为传统服务导向计算的演进，整合AI驱动适应性、多模态交互和隐私优先服务设计。

Result: 框架确保学习保持可访问、包容和安全，能够弥合可访问性差距，支持社交情感发展，赋能神经多样性学习者。

Conclusion: 元宇宙学习具有巨大潜力，需要解决可扩展性、数据隐私和伦理挑战，同时提供政策建议以创建安全、包容和可扩展的学习生态系统。

Abstract: The metaverse offers immersive and adaptive learning environments for
neurodivergent students to thrive and reach their full potential. In this
paper, we propose a generic framework that leverages metaverse services as an
evolution beyond traditional service-oriented computing, enabling more
interactive, personalized, and engaging educational experiences. By integrating
AI-driven adaptability, multimodal interaction, and privacy-first service
design, the framework ensures that learning remains accessible, inclusive, and
secure. Additionally, we explore the challenges associated with scalability,
data privacy, and ethical considerations while highlighting opportunities for
fostering safe and student-centered virtual spaces. Our analysis underscores
the potential of metaverse-based learning to bridge accessibility gaps, support
social-emotional development, and empower neurodivergent learners in both
digital and real-world settings. We also provide recommendations and policy
considerations for creating a secure, inclusive, and scalable metaverse
learn-ing ecosystem for neurodivergent students.

### [90] [How built environment shapes cycling experience: A multi-scale review in historical urban contexts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15657)
*Haining Ding,Chenxi Wang,Michal Gath-Morad*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 本文系统回顾了68项跨学科研究，分析了建成环境如何影响骑行体验，发现现有研究过于依赖客观指标，缺乏对街道景观作为生活环境的关注，需要整合主观体验来解释环境为何促进或阻碍骑行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解建成环境如何塑造人类体验对设计可持续城市至关重要。骑行提供了关键案例，其采用不仅取决于基础设施，更取决于骑行体验。现有研究分散在不同学科和尺度，且偏重网络层面的分析，这在历史城市中尤其成问题。

Method: 系统回顾了68项来自城市规划、交通、行为科学、神经科学和公共卫生的研究。识别了两个分析尺度：宏观尺度（骑行能力）和微观尺度（骑行倾向）。方法分为客观和主观方法，并开始出现混合方法。

Result: 发现研究持续依赖客观代理指标，主观描述的整合有限，对街道景观作为生活环境的关注不足。识别了宏观和微观两个分析尺度，以及客观、主观和混合三种研究方法。

Conclusion: 解决这些差距对于解释环境为何促进或阻碍骑行至关重要，并为设计支持骑行作为出行方式和生活体验的城市提供信息。

Abstract: Understanding how built environments shape human experience is central to
designing sustainable cities. Cycling provides a critical case: it delivers
health and environmental benefits, yet its uptake depends strongly on the
experience of cycling rather than infrastructure alone. Research on this
relationship has grown rapidly but remains fragmented across disciplines and
scales, and has concentrated on network-level analyses of routes and
connectivity. This bias is especially problematic in historical cities, where
embedding new infrastructure is difficult, and where cycling experience is
shaped not only by spatial form but also by how cyclists perceive, interpret,
and physically respond to their environment - through psychological factors
such as safety and comfort, physiological demands such as stress and fatigue,
and perceptual cues in the streetscape. We systematically reviewed 68 studies
across urban planning, transportation, behavioural science, neuroscience, and
public health. Two scales of analysis were identified: a macro scale addressing
the ability to cycle and a micro scale addressing the propensity to cycle.
Methods were classified into objective and subjective approaches, with hybrid
approaches beginning to emerge. We find a persistent reliance on objective
proxies, limited integration of subjective accounts, and insufficient attention
to the streetscape as a lived environment. Addressing these gaps is essential
to explain why environments enable or deter cycling, and to inform the design
of cities that support cycling as both mobility and lived experience.
