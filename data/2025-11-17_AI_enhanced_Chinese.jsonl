Our study focuses on Venezuela's constitutional overhaul in the early 2000s, initiated by Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and implemented through a judicial emergency committee. We employ a hybrid synthetic control and difference-in-differences approach to estimate the impact of populist attacks on judicial independence trajectories. By comparing Venezuela to a stable pool of countries without radical constitutional changes, our identification strategy isolates the effect of populist assaults from unobservable confounders and common time trends. Our findings reveal that authoritarian interventions lead to an immediate and lasting breakdown of judicial independence. The deterioration in judicial independence vis-\u00e1-vis the estimated counterfactual is robust to variations in the donor pool composition. It does not appear to be driven by pre-existing judicial changes and withstands numerous temporal and spatial placebo checks across over nine million randomly sequenced donor samples.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u653f\u5e9c\u4ee5\u73b0\u4ee3\u5316\u4e3a\u540d\u5bf9\u53f8\u6cd5\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u5982\u4f55\u7834\u574f\u53f8\u6cd5\u72ec\u7acb\uff0c\u4ee5\u59d4\u5185\u745e\u62c92000\u5e74\u4ee3\u521d\u7684\u5baa\u6cd5\u6539\u9769\u4e3a\u6848\u4f8b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5a01\u6743\u5e72\u9884\u5bfc\u81f4\u53f8\u6cd5\u72ec\u7acb\u7acb\u5373\u4e14\u6301\u4e45\u7684\u5d29\u6e83\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u6c11\u7cb9\u4e3b\u4e49\u653b\u51fb\u5bf9\u53f8\u6cd5\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u653f\u5e9c\u4ee5\u73b0\u4ee3\u5316\u6539\u9769\u4e3a\u5e4c\u5b50\u5bf9\u53f8\u6cd5\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u5408\u6210\u63a7\u5236\u6cd5\u548c\u53cc\u91cd\u5dee\u5206\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u59d4\u5185\u745e\u62c9\u4e0e\u6ca1\u6709\u6fc0\u8fdb\u5baa\u6cd5\u53d8\u9769\u7684\u56fd\u5bb6\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u4ee5\u5206\u79bb\u6c11\u7cb9\u4e3b\u4e49\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5a01\u6743\u5e72\u9884\u5bfc\u81f4\u53f8\u6cd5\u72ec\u7acb\u7acb\u5373\u4e14\u6301\u4e45\u7684\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u53d1\u73b0\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6350\u8d60\u6c60\u7ec4\u6210\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5065\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u53d7\u5148\u524d\u53f8\u6cd5\u53d8\u9769\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u653f\u5e9c\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u4f2a\u88c5\u6210\u73b0\u4ee3\u5316\u6539\u9769\uff0c\u4e5f\u4f1a\u5bf9\u53f8\u6cd5\u72ec\u7acb\u9020\u6210\u4e25\u91cd\u4e14\u6301\u4e45\u7684\u7834\u574f\u3002"}}

Behind the economic growth, population surge, and continuous improvement of people's living standards lies the enormous consumption of fossil energy and environmental pollution. This kind of pollution has caused irreparable damage to the world. The most concerned environmental issue globally at present is the global warming caused by carbon dioxide emissions. China is in a stage of rapid development, and as the largest developing country, China's development path has a significant impact on global climate change. At the same time, the global community also puts pressure on China to limit carbon dioxide emissions. To address energy shortages and environmental issues, countries around the world have introduced corresponding energy and environmental regulations. Due to different culture and government systems, the effects of energy and environmental regulations in various countries are also different. Therefore, it is still necessary to discuss China's energy and environmental regulations.This paper uses data from prefecture-level cities between 2003 and 2008 to discuss the impact of the \"Eleventh Five-Year Plan\" environmental regulations on urbanization rates. It first provides a theoretical analysis of the relationship between environmental regulation and urbanization, finding that environmental regulation can influence urban population mobility through both crowding-in and crowding-out effects.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u56fd'\u5341\u4e00\u4e94'\u89c4\u5212\u671f\u95f4\u73af\u5883\u89c4\u5236\u5bf9\u57ce\u9547\u5316\u7387\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u73af\u5883\u89c4\u5236\u901a\u8fc7\u6324\u5165\u548c\u6324\u51fa\u6548\u5e94\u5f71\u54cd\u57ce\u5e02\u4eba\u53e3\u6d41\u52a8\u3002", "motivation": "\u5de5\u4e1a\u9769\u547d\u4ee5\u6765\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\u4f34\u968f\u5316\u77f3\u80fd\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u548c\u73af\u5883\u6c61\u67d3\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u4e8c\u6c27\u5316\u78b3\u6392\u653e\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5168\u7403\u53d8\u6696\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4e2d\u56fd\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6700\u5927\u53d1\u5c55\u4e2d\u56fd\u5bb6\uff0c\u5176\u53d1\u5c55\u8def\u5f84\u5bf9\u5168\u7403\u6c14\u5019\u53d8\u5316\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u56fd\u9645\u793e\u4f1a\u9650\u5236\u78b3\u6392\u653e\u7684\u538b\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u75282003-2008\u5e74\u5730\u7ea7\u5e02\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5206\u6790'\u5341\u4e00\u4e94'\u89c4\u5212\u73af\u5883\u89c4\u5236\u5bf9\u57ce\u9547\u5316\u7387\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u73af\u5883\u89c4\u5236\u4e0e\u57ce\u9547\u5316\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u73af\u5883\u89c4\u5236\u901a\u8fc7\u6324\u5165\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u6324\u51fa\u6548\u5e94\u5f71\u54cd\u57ce\u5e02\u4eba\u53e3\u6d41\u52a8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e2d\u56fd\u73af\u5883\u89c4\u5236\u653f\u7b56\u5bf9\u57ce\u9547\u5316\u8fdb\u7a0b\u5177\u6709\u53cc\u91cd\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5728\u53d1\u5c55\u4e2d\u5e73\u8861\u73af\u5883\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e0e\u57ce\u9547\u5316\u63a8\u8fdb\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002"}}

Multiple wars forced Qing China and later the young Republic of China into a series of unequal treaties, one of which was the forced legalisation of the opium trade from parts of the British Empire into China, another was opening several cities, including Shanghai, for trade and granting extensive civil, property and business rights to non-residents and yet another was the annexation of Hong Kong by the United Kingdom. These are the conditions that created HSBC and in which it thrived, including from opium-related profits. During periods of relative calm, the bank grew geographically and made profits -- whether in moral or unethical, whether in legal or unlawful ways -- which helped HSBC weather the storms of civil and world wars. Other aspects contributed to HSBC's survival and success, such as its global nature, which allowed it to diversify and shift away from regions when danger emerges there and find shelter in safer havens. Yet the resilient survival abilities and the financial success of HSBC until 1950 should not distract from the fact that in addition to its tainted cradle and early profits from facilitating the poisoning of a whole society, its human resource system was also discrimination based, attempting to divide the one human race into different groups -- in spite of such practises being opposed to medical and biological facts. What is particularly interesting to see is that not only has HSBC yet to apologise for the early drug-related blood money it made: it even fails to mention its colonial, drug profits tainted past on any of its many history-themed pages sighted. Later sections contain possible reasons for HSBC's resilience and success, particularly interesting for entrepreneurs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6c47\u4e30\u94f6\u884c(HSBC)\u7684\u8d77\u6e90\u548c\u53d1\u5c55\u5386\u53f2\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u5176\u5efa\u7acb\u5728\u6b96\u6c11\u4e3b\u4e49\u3001\u9e26\u7247\u8d38\u6613\u548c\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\u6761\u7ea6\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\uff0c\u65e9\u671f\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u9053\u5fb7\u65b9\u5f0f\u83b7\u5229\u5e76\u5b58\u5728\u6b67\u89c6\u6027\u4eba\u529b\u8d44\u6e90\u5236\u5ea6\uff0c\u81f3\u4eca\u672a\u5bf9\u5176\u5386\u53f2\u8fdb\u884c\u9053\u6b49\u3002", "motivation": "\u63ed\u793a\u6c47\u4e30\u94f6\u884c\u5728\u6b96\u6c11\u5386\u53f2\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u4e0d\u5149\u5f69\u8d77\u6e90\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u5176\u65e9\u671f\u901a\u8fc7\u9e26\u7247\u8d38\u6613\u7b49\u4e0d\u9053\u5fb7\u624b\u6bb5\u83b7\u5229\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8be5\u94f6\u884c\u5982\u4f55\u56de\u907f\u548c\u63a9\u76d6\u8fd9\u6bb5\u5386\u53f2\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5386\u53f2\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8ffd\u6eaf\u6c47\u4e30\u94f6\u884c\u4ece1860\u5e74\u4ee3\u5728\u9999\u6e2f\u6210\u7acb\u52301950\u5e74\u4ee3\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u5386\u7a0b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5728\u6b96\u6c11\u4f53\u7cfb\u4e2d\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u548c\u76c8\u5229\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u6c47\u4e30\u94f6\u884c\u7684\u6210\u529f\u5efa\u7acb\u5728\u9e26\u7247\u8d38\u6613\u3001\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\u6761\u7ea6\u548c\u6b96\u6c11\u6269\u5f20\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\uff0c\u5176\u65e9\u671f\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6b67\u89c6\uff0c\u4e14\u81f3\u4eca\u672a\u5bf9\u8fd9\u6bb5\u5386\u53f2\u8fdb\u884c\u9053\u6b49\u6216\u5145\u5206\u62ab\u9732\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6c47\u4e30\u94f6\u884c\u7684\u6210\u529f\u4e0d\u5e94\u63a9\u76d6\u5176\u4e0d\u9053\u5fb7\u7684\u8d77\u6e90\u5386\u53f2\uff0c\u5176\u4ece\u9e26\u7247\u8d38\u6613\u4e2d\u83b7\u5229\u5e76\u56de\u907f\u5386\u53f2\u8d23\u4efb\u7684\u505a\u6cd5\u503c\u5f97\u53cd\u601d\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5168\u7403\u5316\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u89c4\u907f\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u4f01\u4e1a\u5bb6\u5177\u6709\u501f\u9274\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

However, recent disruptions, particularly post-COVID-19, raise questions about shift in these patterns. This study analyzes housing market date (1991-2024) to examine evolving seasonality and regional heterogeneity. Using Housing Price Index (HPI), inventory and sales data from the Federal Housing Finance Agency and U.S. Census Bureau, seasonal components are extracted via the X-13-ARIMA procedure, and statistical tests assess variations across regions. The results confirm seasonal fluctuations in prices and volumes, with recent shifts toward earlier annual peak (March-April) and amplified seasonal effects.

This paper develops and applies a Bayesian hierarchical model to analyze U.S. county-level mortality and suicide rates from 2010 to 2023. Applying a conditional autoregressive (CAR) structure to each combination of sex and age grouping, the model captures spatial and temporal trends while incorporating mental health surveillance data and socio-economic indicators. We first assess socio-economic covariates in predicting suicide. While the results vary considerably by age and sex, we find that the county-wide levels of educational attainment, housing prices, marriage rates, racial composition, household size, and poor mental health days all have significant relationships with suicide rates. We next consider the impact of various mental health indicators on all-cause and suicide-specific mortality and find that the strongest effects are observed in younger populations. The spatial and temporal correlation structures reveal substantial regional clustering and time-consistent trends in both all-cause mortality and suicide rates, supporting the use of spatio-temporal methods. Our findings highlight the value of integrating mental health surveillance data into mortality models to better identify emerging risk areas and vulnerable populations.

To do so, we first construct a dataset of rankings produced by the system, collecting extensive Talent Search results across a diverse set of occupational queries. We then develop a robust labeling pipeline that infers the two demographic attributes of interest for the returned users. To evaluate potential biases in the collected dataset of real-world rankings, we utilize two exposure disparity metrics: deviation from group proportions and MinSkew. Our analysis reveals an under-representation of minority groups in early ranks across many queries. We further examine potential causes of this disparity, and discuss why they may be difficult or, in some cases, impossible to fully eliminate among the early ranks of queries. Beyond static metrics, we also investigate the concept of subgroup fairness over time, highlighting temporal disparities in exposure and retention, which are often more difficult to audit for in practice. In employer recruiting platforms such as LinkedIn Talent Search, the persistence of a particular candidate over multiple days in the ranking can directly impact the probability that the given candidate is selected for opportunities. Our analysis reveals demographic disparities in this temporal stability, with some groups experiencing greater volatility in their ranked positions than others.

A 7-billion-parameter model (N = 7 x 10^9) with lambda_max = 1.2 drifts from an initial entropy of 0.32 to 1.69 +/- 1.08 nats, while a system regularized with alignment work gamma = 20.4 (1.5 gamma_crit) maintains stability at 0.00 +/- 0.00 nats (p = 4.19 x 10^-17, n = 20 trials).

However, these powerful representations can encode a broad range of task-irrelevant scene information, making the resulting trained policies vulnerable to out-of-domain visual changes and distractors. In this work we address visuomotor policy feature pooling as a solution to the observed lack of robustness in perturbed scenes. We achieve this via Attentive Feature Aggregation (AFA), a lightweight, trainable pooling mechanism that learns to naturally attend to task-relevant visual cues, ignoring even semantically rich scene distractors. Through extensive experiments in both simulation and the real world, we demonstrate that policies trained with AFA significantly outperform standard pooling approaches in the presence of visual perturbations, without requiring expensive dataset augmentation or fine-tuning of the PVR. Our findings show that ignoring extraneous visual information is a crucial step towards deploying robust and generalisable visuomotor policies.

Inspired by the stochastic nature of biological spiking mechanism and recent hardware trends, we propose a stochastic EP framework that integrates probabilistic spiking neurons into the EP paradigm. This formulation smoothens the optimization landscape, stabilizes training, and enables scalable learning in deep convolutional spiking convergent recurrent neural networks (CRNNs). We provide theoretical guarantees showing that the proposed stochastic EP dynamics approximate deterministic EP under mean-field theory, thereby inheriting its underlying theoretical guarantees.

The results reveal that AI users are significantly more likely to report improvements across all three outcomes, with effects ranging from 8.9% to 21.3%. However, these benefits vary by generation and gender. Generation Y (1981-1996) shows the strongest gains across all dimensions, while Generation X (1965-1980) reports moderate improvements in mental health and job enjoyment. In contrast, Generation Z (1997-2012) benefits only in job enjoyment. As digital natives already familiar with technology, Gen Z workers may not receive additional gains in mental or physical health from AI, though they still experience increased enjoyment from using it.

Aiming at characterizing via a rigorous mathematical analysis, the main features of the spontaneous organization and functioning of such markets, we introduce and we study a stylized dynamical model for the time evolution of buyers populations and prices/attractiveness at each wholesaler. The dynamics is governed by immediate reactions of the actors to changes in basic indicators. Buyers are influenced by some degree of loyalty to their regular suppliers. Yet, at times, they also prospect for potential better offers. On the other hand, sellers primarily aim at maximising their profit. Yet, they can be also prone to improving their competitiveness in case of clientele deficit.\n  Our results reveal that, in spite of being governed by simple and immediate rules, the competition between sellers self-regulates in time, as it constrains to bounded ranges the dispersion of both prices and clientele volumes, does similarly for the mean clientele volume, and it generates oscillatory behaviours that prevent any seller to dominate permanently its competitors (and to be dominated forever). Long-term behaviours are also investigated, with focus on asymptotic convergence to an equilibrium, as can be expected for a standard functioning mode. In particular, in the simplest case of 2 competing sellers, a normal-form-like analysis proves that such convergence holds, provided that the buyer's loyalty is sufficiently high or the sellers' reactivity is sufficiently low. In other words, this result identifies and proves those characteristics of the system that are responsible for long term stability and asymptotic damping of the oscillations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u884c\u4e3a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u5206\u6790\u573a\u5916\u751f\u9c9c\u4ea7\u54c1\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u81ea\u7ec4\u7ec7\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5373\u4f7f\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b80\u5355\u5373\u65f6\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u5356\u5bb6\u7ade\u4e89\u4e5f\u80fd\u81ea\u6211\u8c03\u8282\u4ef7\u683c\u548c\u5ba2\u6237\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u4ea7\u751f\u632f\u8361\u884c\u4e3a\u9632\u6b62\u5e02\u573a\u5784\u65ad\u3002", "motivation": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6709\u9650\u7406\u6027\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u53d7\u9650\u548c\u77ed\u671f\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u573a\u5916\u751f\u9c9c\u4ea7\u54c1\u5e02\u573a\u662f\u53d1\u5c55\u5fae\u89c2\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7cfb\u7edf\u884c\u4e3a\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7406\u60f3\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u4e25\u8c28\u6570\u5b66\u5206\u6790\u523b\u753b\u6b64\u7c7b\u5e02\u573a\u81ea\u53d1\u7ec4\u7ec7\u548c\u8fd0\u4f5c\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u98ce\u683c\u5316\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e70\u65b9\u7fa4\u4f53\u548c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6279\u53d1\u5546\u4ef7\u683c/\u5438\u5f15\u529b\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u5316\u3002\u52a8\u6001\u7531\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u5bf9\u57fa\u672c\u6307\u6807\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u5373\u65f6\u53cd\u5e94\u9a71\u52a8\uff0c\u4e70\u65b9\u53d7\u5fe0\u8bda\u5ea6\u5f71\u54cd\u4f46\u4e5f\u5bfb\u6c42\u66f4\u597d\u62a5\u4ef7\uff0c\u5356\u65b9\u4e3b\u8981\u8ffd\u6c42\u5229\u6da6\u6700\u5927\u5316\u4f46\u4e5f\u4f1a\u5728\u5ba2\u6237\u4e0d\u8db3\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u7531\u7b80\u5355\u5373\u65f6\u89c4\u5219\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5356\u5bb6\u7ade\u4e89\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u81ea\u6211\u8c03\u8282\uff0c\u5c06\u4ef7\u683c\u548c\u5ba2\u6237\u91cf\u5206\u6563\u9650\u5236\u5728\u6709\u9650\u8303\u56f4\u5185\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u632f\u8361\u884c\u4e3a\u9632\u6b62\u4efb\u4f55\u5356\u5bb6\u6c38\u4e45\u4e3b\u5bfc\u5e02\u573a\u3002\u57282\u4e2a\u5356\u5bb6\u7ade\u4e89\u7684\u6700\u7b80\u5355\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u8bc1\u660e\u5f53\u4e70\u65b9\u5fe0\u8bda\u5ea6\u8db3\u591f\u9ad8\u6216\u5356\u65b9\u53cd\u5e94\u6027\u8db3\u591f\u4f4e\u65f6\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f1a\u6536\u655b\u5230\u5747\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u957f\u671f\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u632f\u8361\u6e10\u8fd1\u963b\u5c3c\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5e02\u573a\u81ea\u6211\u8c03\u8282\u673a\u5236\u5982\u4f55\u786e\u4fdd\u7ade\u4e89\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002"}}

Due to the lack of trust between relevant parties, verification is a key part of the agreement. Limits on the scale of AI training are operationalized by FLOP thresholds and verified through the tracking of AI chips and verification of chip use. Dangerous AI research--that which advances toward artificial superintelligence or endangers the agreement's verifiability--is stopped via legal prohibitions and multifaceted verification.\n  We believe the proposal would be technically sufficient if implemented today, but advancements in AI capabilities or development methods would hurt its efficacy.

While effective GUI agents synergistically integrate planning and grounding capabilities, current methodologies exhibit two fundamental limitations: (1) insufficient exploitation of cross-model synergies, and (2) over-reliance on synthetic data generation without sufficient utilization. To address these challenges, we propose Co-EPG, a self-iterative training framework for Co-Evolution of Planning and Grounding. Co-EPG establishes an iterative positive feedback loop: through this loop, the planning model explores superior strategies under grounding-based reward guidance via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), generating diverse data to optimize the grounding model. Concurrently, the optimized Grounding model provides more effective rewards for subsequent GRPO training of the planning model, fostering continuous improvement. Co-EPG thus enables iterative enhancement of agent capabilities through self-play optimization and training data distillation. On the Multimodal-Mind2Web and AndroidControl benchmarks, our framework outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods after just three iterations without requiring external data.

This paper reports on a pilot deployment of an ARI social robot functioning as a university receptionist, designed in alignment with the SecuRoPS framework for secure and ethical social robot deployment. Thirty-five students and staff interacted with the robot and provided structured feedback on safety, privacy, usability, accessibility, and transparency. The results show generally positive perceptions of physical safety, data protection, and ethical behavior, while also highlighting challenges related to accessibility, inclusiveness, and dynamic interaction. Beyond the empirical findings, the study demonstrates how theoretical frameworks for ethical and secure design can be implemented in real-world contexts through end-user evaluation. It also provides a public GitHub repository containing reusable templates for ARI robot applications to support reproducibility and lower the entry barrier for new researchers.

While notions like differential privacy have been successfully introduced to dynamical systems, it is still unclear how a system's privacy can be properly protected when facing the challenging yet frequently-encountered scenario where an adversary possesses prior knowledge, e.g., the steady state, of the system. This paper presents a new systematic approach to protect the privacy of a discrete-time linear time-invariant system against adversaries knowledgeable of the system's prior information. We employ a tailored \\emph{pointwise maximal leakage (PML) privacy} criterion. PML characterizes the worst-case privacy performance, which is sharply different from that of the better-known mutual-information privacy. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for PML privacy and construct tractable design procedures. Furthermore, our analysis leads to insight into how PML privacy, differential privacy, and mutual-information privacy are related. We then revisit Kalman filters from the perspective of PML privacy and derive a lower bound on the steady-state estimation-error covariance in terms of the PML parameters. Finally, the derived results are illustrated in a case study of privacy protection for distributed sensing in smart buildings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4fdd\u62a4\u79bb\u6563\u65f6\u95f4\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u4e0d\u53d8\u7cfb\u7edf\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u5df2\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5148\u9a8c\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u5bf9\u624b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u70b9\u6001\u6700\u5927\u6cc4\u9732\u9690\u79c1\u51c6\u5219\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e0e\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u72b6\u6001\u6d89\u53ca\u654f\u611f\u4fe1\u606f\u65f6\uff0c\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5df2\u6709\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u5bf9\u638c\u63e1\u7cfb\u7edf\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff08\u5982\u7a33\u6001\uff09\u7684\u5bf9\u624b\u65f6\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\u4ecd\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u70b9\u6001\u6700\u5927\u6cc4\u9732\u9690\u79c1\u51c6\u5219\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86PML\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u5145\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86PML\u9690\u79c1\u4e0e\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u3001\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86PML\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u5145\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u9690\u79c1\u5ea6\u91cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u4e2d\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u7a33\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u7684\u4e0b\u754c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684PML\u9690\u79c1\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u62a4\u7cfb\u7edf\u9690\u79c1\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5bf9\u624b\u638c\u63e1\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u5efa\u7b51\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u4f20\u611f\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Furthermore, the nature of crowdsourcing dictates the budget for tasks and workers' remuneration, and excessively large team sizes may reduce collaborative performance. To address these challenges, we propose a heuristic optimization algorithm that leverages social network information to simultaneously form teams with optimized worker compatibility for multiple tasks. In our approach, historical collaboration is represented as a social network, where the edge weights correspond to explicit ratings of worker compatibility. In a simulation experiment using synthetic data, we applied Gaussian process regression to examine the relationship between eight experimental parameters and evaluation values, thereby analyzing the output of the proposed algorithm. To generate the necessary data for regression, we ran the proposed algorithm with experimental parameters that were sequentially estimated using Bayesian optimization. Our experiments revealed that the evaluation values were extremely low when the team size limit, the degree mean of the social network, and the task budget were set to low values. The results also indicate that the proposed algorithm outperformed the hill-climbing method under almost all experimental conditions. In addition, the highest evaluation values were achieved when the simulated annealing temperature decrease rate was approximately 0.9, while smoothing the objective function proved ineffective.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u793e\u4ea4\u7f51\u7edc\u4fe1\u606f\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u56e2\u961f\u7ec4\u5efa\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u5de5\u4eba\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u548c\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u722c\u5c71\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u4f17\u5305\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u591a\u4eba\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u5de5\u4eba\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u3001\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u9884\u7b97\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u56e2\u961f\u89c4\u6a21\u8fc7\u5927\u5f71\u54cd\u534f\u4f5c\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u793e\u4ea4\u7f51\u7edc\u8868\u793a\u5386\u53f2\u534f\u4f5c\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u8fb9\u6743\u91cd\u5bf9\u5e94\u5de5\u4eba\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u8bc4\u5206\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u7ec4\u5efa\u56e2\u961f\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u56de\u5f52\u5206\u6790\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53c2\u6570\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u503c\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u4f30\u8ba1\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5f53\u56e2\u961f\u89c4\u6a21\u9650\u5236\u3001\u793e\u4ea4\u7f51\u7edc\u5e73\u5747\u5ea6\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u9884\u7b97\u8bbe\u7f6e\u8f83\u4f4e\u65f6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u503c\u6781\u4f4e\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u51e0\u4e4e\u6240\u6709\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u90fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u722c\u5c71\u6cd5\uff1b\u6a21\u62df\u9000\u706b\u6e29\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u7387\u7ea6\u4e3a0.9\u65f6\u83b7\u5f97\u6700\u9ad8\u8bc4\u4f30\u503c\uff1b\u5e73\u6ed1\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u65e0\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u793e\u4ea4\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u56e2\u961f\u7ec4\u5efa\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4f18\u5316\u5de5\u4eba\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u4f17\u5305\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u56e2\u961f\u7ec4\u5efa\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Media attention and short-run shifts in Trump's Truth Social posts", "comment": null, "summary": "Political \"circuses\" may undermine democratic accountability if leaders facing scandal can reliably pull media coverage toward fresh topics and away from substantive investigations or evaluations. We investigate whether politicians strategically alter their messaging during damaging media coverage (\"strategic diversion\") or maintain consistent provocative communication regardless of scandal coverage (\"always-on circus\"). Using computational text analysis of Donald Trump's Truth Social posts during the 2025 Epstein revelations, we find that a one-standard-deviation increase in scandal coverage is associated with communication patterns that deviate from baseline by 0.28 standard deviations over a 4-day window. Although these findings do not provide formal causal identification, they are robust to timing placebos and falsification tests, are consistent with the interpretation that leaders may deploy diversionary communication specifically within their own friendly media ecosystem, which has implications for accountability in polarized democracies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5f53\u9762\u4e34\u4e11\u95fb\u62a5\u9053\u65f6\uff0c\u653f\u6cbb\u9886\u5bfc\u4eba\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u53d8\u6c9f\u901a\u6a21\u5f0f\u6765\u8f6c\u79fb\u5a92\u4f53\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u8f6c\u79fb\u884c\u4e3a\u5728\u7279\u6717\u666e\u7684Truth Social\u5e16\u5b50\u4e2d\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u653f\u6cbb\u9886\u5bfc\u4eba\u5728\u9762\u4e34\u8d1f\u9762\u5a92\u4f53\u62a5\u9053\u65f6\u662f\u5426\u4f1a\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u5730\u6539\u53d8\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u4ee5\u8f6c\u79fb\u516c\u4f17\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u524a\u5f31\u6c11\u4e3b\u95ee\u8d23\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u8ba1\u7b97\u6587\u672c\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u7279\u6717\u666e\u57282025\u5e74\u7231\u6cfc\u65af\u5766\u4e11\u95fb\u66dd\u5149\u671f\u95f4Truth Social\u5e16\u5b50\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e11\u95fb\u62a5\u9053\u589e\u52a0\u4e0e\u6c9f\u901a\u6a21\u5f0f\u53d8\u5316\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u4e11\u95fb\u62a5\u9053\u6bcf\u589e\u52a0\u4e00\u4e2a\u6807\u51c6\u5dee\uff0c\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6c9f\u901a\u6a21\u5f0f\u57284\u5929\u7a97\u53e3\u671f\u5185\u504f\u79bb\u57fa\u7ebf0.28\u4e2a\u6807\u51c6\u5dee\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u53d1\u73b0\u901a\u8fc7\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u5b89\u6170\u5242\u548c\u8bc1\u4f2a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9886\u5bfc\u4eba\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u5176\u53cb\u597d\u7684\u5a92\u4f53\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\u8f6c\u79fb\u6027\u6c9f\u901a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u6781\u5316\u6c11\u4e3b\u56fd\u5bb6\u7684\u95ee\u8d23\u5236\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

Murtuza", "Md Oliullah"], "title": "Generative Artificial Intelligence Adoption Among Bangladeshi Journalists: Exploring Journalists' Awareness, Acceptance, Usage, and Organizational Stance on Generative AI", "comment": null, "summary": "Newsrooms and journalists across the world are adopting Generative AI (GenAI). Drawing on in-depth interviews with 23 journalists, this study identifies Bangladeshi journalists' awareness, acceptance, usage patterns, and their media organizations' stance toward GenAI. This study finds Bangladeshi journalists' high reliance on GenAI like their Western colleagues despite limited institutional support and the near absence of AI policy. Despite this contrast, concerns over GenAI's implications in journalism between the West and non-West were mostly identical. Moreover, this study contributes to the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) by proposing two changes regarding GenAI adoption among journalists in non-Western settings. First, this study identifies the non-contribution of facilitating conditions in shaping behavioral intent in GenAI adoption in non-Western contexts.

To reduce the cognitive load on the decision maker, previous work has introduced the Pareto pruning problem, where the goal is to compute a fixed-size subset of Pareto optimal solutions that best represent the full set, as evaluated by a given quality measure. Reframing Pareto pruning as a multiwinner voting problem, we conduct an axiomatic analysis of existing quality measures, uncovering several unintuitive behaviors. Motivated by these findings, we introduce a new measure, directed coverage. We also analyze the computational complexity of optimizing various quality measures, identifying previously unknown boundaries between tractable and intractable cases depending on the number and structure of the objectives. Finally, we present an experimental evaluation, demonstrating that the choice of quality measure has a decisive impact on the characteristics of the selected set of solutions and that our proposed measure performs competitively or even favorably across a range of settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u7684Pareto\u526a\u679d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u591a\u8d62\u5bb6\u6295\u7968\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u8d28\u91cf\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5b9a\u5411\u8986\u76d6\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u51b3\u7b56\u95ee\u9898\u901a\u5e38\u6d89\u53ca\u591a\u4e2a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u51b3\u7b56\u8005\u9700\u8981\u4ecePareto\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u96c6\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u5b50\u96c6\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u8d28\u91cf\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u53cd\u76f4\u89c9\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u5c06Pareto\u526a\u679d\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u591a\u8d62\u5bb6\u6295\u7968\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u516c\u7406\u5206\u6790\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u7684\u5b9a\u5411\u8986\u76d6\u5ea6\u91cf\uff1b\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u8d28\u91cf\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff1b\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u8d28\u91cf\u5ea6\u91cf\u5b58\u5728\u53cd\u76f4\u89c9\u884c\u4e3a\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5b9a\u5411\u8986\u76d6\u5ea6\u91cf\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u6216\u66f4\u4f18\uff1b\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u8d28\u91cf\u5ea6\u91cf\u4f18\u5316\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u76ee\u6807\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8d28\u91cf\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u6240\u9009\u89e3\u96c6\u7279\u6027\u6709\u51b3\u5b9a\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u65b0\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5b9a\u5411\u8986\u76d6\u5ea6\u91cf\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u51b3\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

This work describes a unique spatiotemporally resolved data set of U.S. electricity costs and emissions and applies time series approximation methods to quantify the alignment of electricity cost and emission incentives for large commercial and industrial consumers. We present a comprehensive spatiotemporal dataset of U.S. price-based demand response (i.e., tariff) and incentive-based demand response (IBDR) programs, enabling direct comparison to previously published marginal emission factor (MEF), average emission factor (AEF), and day-ahead market (DAM) prices. We resolved the structural incompatibility and fragmentation of these datasets by developing time series approximations of discrete data and unifying geospatially heterogeneous datasets. Analysis of these datasets reveals significant spatial and temporal heterogeneity in cost and carbon emissions incentives for demand-side energy flexibility, underscoring the importance of site selection as a key factor influencing power costs and scope 2 emissions. Analysis also reveals broad misalignment of economic and emissions incentives under existing electricity tariff structures, meaning tariffs are incentivizing consumption of more carbon-intensive electricity, and highlighting potential barriers to electrification delivering carbon savings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7f8e\u56fd\u7535\u4ef7\u548c\u6392\u653e\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5546\u4e1a\u548c\u5de5\u4e1a\u7528\u7535\u8d1f\u8377\u589e\u957f\u7684\u6210\u672c\u548c\u78b3\u6392\u653e\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u7535\u4ef7\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u6392\u653e\u6fc0\u52b1\u5b58\u5728\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9519\u4f4d\u3002", "motivation": "\u7f8e\u56fd\u5546\u4e1a\u548c\u5de5\u4e1a\u7528\u7535\u8d1f\u8377\u589e\u957f\u8fc5\u901f\uff0c\u4f46\u7535\u529b\u6210\u672c\u548c\u78b3\u6392\u653e\u5f71\u54cd\u5bf9\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u548c\u7535\u529b\u516c\u53f8\u90fd\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u91cf\u5316\u7535\u529b\u6210\u672c\u548c\u6392\u653e\u6fc0\u52b1\u7684\u5339\u914d\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u65f6\u7a7a\u89e3\u6790\u7684\u7f8e\u56fd\u7535\u4ef7\u548c\u6392\u653e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\u7edf\u4e00\u5730\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u5f02\u6784\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4ef7\u683c\u578b\u9700\u6c42\u54cd\u5e94\u548c\u6fc0\u52b1\u578b\u9700\u6c42\u54cd\u5e94\u9879\u76ee\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u6210\u672c\u548c\u78b3\u6392\u653e\u6fc0\u52b1\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u65f6\u7a7a\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff0c\u7535\u4ef7\u7ed3\u6784\u6fc0\u52b1\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u78b3\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7535\u529b\u7684\u6d88\u8d39\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u963b\u788d\u7535\u6c14\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u78b3\u51cf\u6392\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ad9\u70b9\u9009\u62e9\u662f\u5f71\u54cd\u7535\u529b\u6210\u672c\u548c\u8303\u56f42\u6392\u653e\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7535\u4ef7\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u6392\u653e\u6fc0\u52b1\u9519\u4f4d\u53ef\u80fd\u6210\u4e3a\u7535\u6c14\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u78b3\u51cf\u6392\u7684\u969c\u788d\u3002"}}

We introduce Heron's Information Coefficient (HIC), a geometric measure that quantifies how subgraphs deviate from the global structure of a network. Applied to over eight years of Brazilian bidding data for medical supplies, this measure highlights collusive patterns that standard indicators may overlook. Unlike conventional robustness metrics, the Heron coefficient focuses on the interaction between active and inactive subgraphs, revealing structural shifts that may signal coordinated behavior, such as cartel formation. Synthetic experiments support these findings, demonstrating strong detection performance across varying corruption intensities and network sizes. While our results do not replace legal or economic analyses, they offer an effective complementary tool for auditors and policymakers to monitor procurement integrity more effectively. This study demonstrates that simple geometric insight can reveal hidden dynamics in real-world networks better than other Information Theoretic metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Heron\u4fe1\u606f\u7cfb\u6570(HIC)\u8fd9\u4e00\u51e0\u4f55\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u5df4\u897f\u533b\u7597\u91c7\u8d2d\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u6b3a\u8bc8\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u6307\u6807\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u53d1\u73b0\u4e32\u901a\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5df4\u897f\u7edf\u4e00\u536b\u751f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7b49\u5927\u578b\u5206\u6563\u5316\u91c7\u8d2d\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u6b3a\u8bc8\u95ee\u9898\u6301\u7eed\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u53d1\u73b0\u6807\u51c6\u6307\u6807\u53ef\u80fd\u5ffd\u7565\u7684\u4e32\u901a\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165Heron\u4fe1\u606f\u7cfb\u6570(HIC)\u4f5c\u4e3a\u51e0\u4f55\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u5b50\u56fe\u4e0e\u7f51\u7edc\u5168\u5c40\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u504f\u79bb\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5df4\u897f8\u5e74\u533b\u7597\u7528\u54c1\u62db\u6807\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "HIC\u80fd\u591f\u63ed\u793a\u4f20\u7edf\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u6307\u6807\u65e0\u6cd5\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u4e32\u901a\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8150\u8d25\u5f3a\u5ea6\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0b\u90fd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "HIC\u4e3a\u5ba1\u8ba1\u4eba\u5458\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8865\u5145\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u6d1e\u5bdf\u529b\u6bd4\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u6307\u6807\u66f4\u80fd\u63ed\u793a\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u9690\u85cf\u52a8\u6001\u3002"}}

We introduce assignment partition -- a partition of agents and choice sets that builds CE into feasibility -- and, within this structure, propose two new mechanisms.\n  Chain Serial Dictatorship (C-SD) operates within the partition as a binding-choice chain: the highest-priority agent picks from its allowed set and the right to pick passes to the owner of the chosen object; if that owner has already picked, the right reverts to the highest-priority remaining agent. Two-Stage Serial Dictatorship (T-SD) operates within the partition as a nominate-then-assign procedure: in Stage 1, agents tentatively nominate objects in exogenous priority, and the owners of nominated objects determine an endogenous final priority; in Stage 2, serial dictatorship runs within the partition using that final priority. For any given assignment partition, C-SD and T-SD simultaneously satisfy strategy-proofness, respecting improvement, and efficiency relative to the partition.\n  We then examine the limits of pursuing market-wide efficiency under the CE constraint. As a benchmark, we study a modified TTC, CE-TTC, which first enforces a CE-compliant reassignment and then runs a self-avoiding top-trading-cycles phase; CE-TTC achieves efficiency within the CE constraint and strategy-proofness but fails respecting improvement. Moreover, for three and four agents, no mechanism can simultaneously achieve efficiency within the CE constraint, respecting improvement, and strategy-proofness. These findings underscore the value of partition-based design for truthful implementation with investment incentives under a hard CE mandate.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u5b8c\u5168\u4ea4\u6362\u8981\u6c42\u4e0b\u7684\u4e00\u5bf9\u4e00\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u914d\u5206\u533a\u7684\u65b0\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u94fe\u5f0f\u5e8f\u5217\u72ec\u88c1\u548c\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5e8f\u5217\u72ec\u88c1\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u673a\u5236\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u7b56\u7565\u8bc1\u660e\u6027\u3001\u5c0a\u91cd\u6539\u8fdb\u548c\u5206\u533a\u5185\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u5b8c\u5168\u4ea4\u6362\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u5339\u914d\u673a\u5236\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7406\u5fc5\u987b\u5206\u914d\u5230\u4e0e\u5176\u521d\u59cb\u7980\u8d4b\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5bf9\u8c61\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u65e2\u6ee1\u8db3\u6548\u7387\u53c8\u4fdd\u6301\u6fc0\u52b1\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u7684\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5206\u914d\u5206\u533a\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6b64\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u65b0\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u94fe\u5f0f\u5e8f\u5217\u72ec\u88c1\uff08C-SD\uff09\u548c\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5e8f\u5217\u72ec\u88c1\uff08T-SD\uff09\u3002C-SD\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed1\u5b9a\u9009\u62e9\u94fe\u8fd0\u4f5c\uff0cT-SD\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u540d-\u5206\u914d\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u7a0b\u5e8f\u8fd0\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "C-SD\u548cT-SD\u673a\u5236\u5728\u7ed9\u5b9a\u5206\u914d\u5206\u533a\u4e0b\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u7b56\u7565\u8bc1\u660e\u6027\u3001\u5c0a\u91cd\u6539\u8fdb\u548c\u5206\u533a\u5185\u6548\u7387\u3002\u4fee\u6539\u7684TTC\u673a\u5236\uff08CE-TTC\uff09\u5728CE\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u6548\u7387\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u5c0a\u91cd\u6539\u8fdb\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e09\u5230\u56db\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u673a\u5236\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0CE\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u6548\u7387\u3001\u5c0a\u91cd\u6539\u8fdb\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u8bc1\u660e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u914d\u5206\u533a\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5728\u786c\u6027\u5b8c\u5168\u4ea4\u6362\u8981\u6c42\u4e0b\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u6295\u8d44\u6fc0\u52b1\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u5b9e\u65bd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u673a\u5236\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002"}}

Disciplinary, institutional and individual norms and conventions developed to support research are challenged, often leaving scholars with a sense of unease or lack of clarity. The growing availability of hacked data is one area. Discussions and debates around the use of these datasets in research are extremely limited. Reviews of the history, culture, or morality of the act of hacking are topics that have attracted some scholarly attention. However, how to undertake research with this data is less examined and provides an opportunity for the generation of reflexive ethical practice. This article presents a case-study outlining the ethical debates that arose when considering the use of hacked data to examine online far-right violent extremism. It argues that under certain circumstances, researchers can do ethical research with hacked data.

It is even known that modern SAT solvers work efficiently on instances of small treewidth. Since these solvers are widely applied, research interests in compact encodings into (Q)SAT for solving and to understand encoding limitations. Even more general is the graph parameter clique-width, which unlike treewidth can be small for dense graphs. Although algorithms are available for clique-width, little is known about encodings. We initiate the quest to understand encoding capabilities with clique-width by considering abstract argumentation, which is a robust framework for reasoning with conflicting arguments. It is based on directed graphs and asks for computationally challenging properties, making it a natural candidate to study computational properties. We design novel reductions from argumentation problems to (Q)SAT. Our reductions linearly preserve the clique-width, resulting in directed decomposition-guided (DDG) reductions. We establish novel results for all argumentation semantics, including counting.

Few platforms exist today for SAR, and fewer still have the ability to cover both tasks of terrain adaptability and high-force output when performing extraction. While legged robots offer significant ability to traverse uneven terrain, they typically are unable to incorporate mechanisms that provide variable high-force outputs, unlike traditional wheel-based drive trains. This work introduces a novel concept for a dynamically extensible and retractable robot leg. Leveraging a dynamically extensible and retractable five-bar linkage design, it allows for mechanically switching between height-advantaged and force-advantaged configurations via a geometric transformation. A testbed evaluated leg performance across linkage geometries and operating modes, with empirical and analytical analyses conducted on stride length, force output, and stability. The results demonstrate that the morphing leg offers a promising path toward SAR robots that can both navigate terrain quickly and perform rescue tasks effectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u52a8\u6001\u53ef\u4f38\u7f29\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u817f\u90e8\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e94\u8fde\u6746\u673a\u6784\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f18\u52bf\u548c\u529b\u91cf\u4f18\u52bf\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u673a\u68b0\u5207\u6362\uff0c\u4e3a\u641c\u6551\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63d0\u4f9b\u5730\u5f62\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u529b\u91cf\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u641c\u6551\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u9700\u8981\u540c\u65f6\u5177\u5907\u5feb\u901f\u7a7f\u8d8a\u5730\u5f62\u548c\u6267\u884c\u9ad8\u529b\u91cf\u6551\u63f4\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u5e73\u53f0\u96be\u4ee5\u517c\u987e\u5730\u5f62\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u529b\u91cf\u8f93\u51fa\u3002\u817f\u5f0f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64c5\u957f\u5730\u5f62\u7a7f\u8d8a\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9ad8\u529b\u91cf\u8f93\u51fa\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u800c\u8f6e\u5f0f\u9a71\u52a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u5219\u76f8\u53cd\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u53ef\u4f38\u7f29\u7684\u4e94\u8fde\u6746\u673a\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u53d8\u6362\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f18\u52bf\u548c\u529b\u91cf\u4f18\u52bf\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u673a\u68b0\u5207\u6362\u3002\u6784\u5efa\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u8fde\u6746\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\u7684\u817f\u90e8\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u5206\u6790\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u53d8\u5f62\u817f\u5728\u6b65\u5e45\u957f\u5ea6\u3001\u529b\u91cf\u8f93\u51fa\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4e3a\u641c\u6551\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u6280\u672f\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u79cd\u53d8\u5f62\u817f\u90e8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e3a\u641c\u6551\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u5730\u5f62\u5bfc\u822a\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6551\u63f4\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose a data-driven computational framework for coupled opinion-adoption dynamics in social systems. Each node in the multilayer network represents a community characterized by a specific age group and mobility level, derived from large-scale survey data on the predisposition to adopt electric vehicles in Northern Europe. The proposed model captures three mechanisms: behavioral contagion through social and informational diffusion, abandonment driven by dissatisfaction, and feedback between opinions and adoption levels through social influence. Analyzing the equilibrium points of the coupled system allows us to derive the conditions that enable large-scale adoption. We empirically calibrate the model using data to construct synthetic populations and social similarity networks, which we use to explore targeted interventions that promote sustainable transitions. Specifically, the analysis focuses on two types of control strategies: opinion-based policies, which act on the social network layer, and policies that aim to improve experience and reduce dissatisfaction. Simulation results show that the latter ensure more stable and long-term adoption, offering concrete insights for designing effective interventions in sociotechnical transitions toward sustainability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6a21\u62df\u793e\u4f1a\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8026\u5408\u7684\u610f\u89c1-\u91c7\u7eb3\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u7535\u52a8\u6c7d\u8f66\u5728\u5317\u6b27\u7684\u91c7\u7528\u60c5\u51b5\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u884c\u4e3a\u4f20\u67d3\u3001\u653e\u5f03\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u610f\u89c1\u53cd\u9988\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u5747\u8861\u70b9\u6765\u63a8\u5bfc\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u91c7\u7528\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u884c\u4e3a\u5728\u5f02\u8d28\u793e\u4f1a\u4e2d\u7684\u4f20\u64ad\u9700\u8981\u6574\u5408\u884c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u3001\u793e\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u673a\u5236\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u8f6c\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u5c42\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8282\u70b9\u4ee3\u8868\u5177\u6709\u7279\u5b9a\u5e74\u9f84\u7ec4\u548c\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u793e\u533a\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u793e\u4f1a\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u5316\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u4f20\u67d3\u3001\u4e0d\u6ee1\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u653e\u5f03\u884c\u4e3a\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u901a\u8fc7\u793e\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u610f\u89c1\u4e0e\u91c7\u7528\u6c34\u5e73\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u62df\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u6539\u5584\u4f53\u9a8c\u548c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e0d\u6ee1\u7684\u653f\u7b56\u6bd4\u57fa\u4e8e\u610f\u89c1\u7684\u653f\u7b56\u66f4\u80fd\u786e\u4fdd\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u957f\u671f\u7684\u91c7\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6539\u5584\u4f53\u9a8c\u548c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e0d\u6ee1\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u6bd4\u5355\u7eaf\u57fa\u4e8e\u793e\u4f1a\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u610f\u89c1\u653f\u7b56\u66f4\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4fc3\u8fdb\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u8f6c\u578b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5177\u4f53\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

The market impact of its disclosure depends on the position and precision of the disclosed range. When the linear combination of private signal and noise trading volume is distant from the disclosed range, the reaction of price to a variation in private signal will almost vanish, whereas a movement of the disclosed range can affect the price efficiently.

Decision-makers often rank expected potential outcomes (or their corresponding utility and desirability) to compare the preferences of candidate actions. In this paper, we study new counterfactual decision-making rules by introducing two new metrics: the probabilities of potential outcome ranking (PoR) and the probability of achieving the best potential outcome (PoB).

Computational models of DBS are widely used to investigate the effects of stimulation on neural tissue, to explore stimulation targets and sweetspots, and ultimately, to aid clinicians in the DBS programming by calculating the stimulation parameters. Commonly, DBS is performed bilaterally, i.e. with one lead in each brain hemisphere, where computational models are solved independently for one lead at a time. This paper treats scenarios where multiple DBS leads are implanted in close proximity to one another, resulting in interacting electrical fields and, therefore, potentially overlapping stimulation spreads. In particular, a global dual-lead model is compared to approximations derived from single-lead approaches in a cohort of twelve multiple sclerosis (MS) tremor patients. It is concluded that simple superposition of volumes of tissue activated (VTAs) underestimates activation, while superposition of electric fields or activating functions leads to overestimation. It is concluded that given close proximity of DBS leads, the VTA cannot be computed individually as stimulation fields exhibit significant and complex interaction. The approach is extended to modeling two obsessive compulsive disorder patients with medially placed leads, where similar VTA discrepancies as in the MS patient cohort are observed.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u591a\u5bfc\u8054\u6df1\u90e8\u8111\u523a\u6fc0(DBS)\u4e2d\u7535\u573a\u4ea4\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5bf9\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4f53\u79ef(VTA)\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5728\u5bfc\u8054\u8ddd\u79bb\u8f83\u8fd1\u65f6\uff0c\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u5355\u5bfc\u8054VTA\u53e0\u52a0\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5168\u5c40\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfDBS\u8ba1\u7b97\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u5e38\u72ec\u7acb\u5904\u7406\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5bfc\u8054\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u591a\u5bfc\u8054\u8fd1\u8ddd\u79bb\u690d\u5165\u65f6\uff0c\u7535\u573a\u4f1a\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u523a\u6fc0\u8303\u56f4\u91cd\u53e0\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u5168\u5c40\u53cc\u5bfc\u8054\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5355\u5bfc\u8054\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u572812\u540d\u591a\u53d1\u6027\u786c\u5316\u9707\u98a4\u60a3\u8005\u4e2d\u5206\u6790VTA\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u65b9\u6cd5\u6269\u5c55\u52302\u540d\u5f3a\u8feb\u75c7\u60a3\u8005\u3002", "result": "\u7b80\u5355VTA\u53e0\u52a0\u4f1a\u4f4e\u4f30\u6fc0\u6d3b\uff0c\u7535\u573a\u6216\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u53e0\u52a0\u4f1a\u9ad8\u4f30\u6fc0\u6d3b\uff1b\u5bfc\u8054\u8ddd\u79bb\u8f83\u8fd1\u65f6\uff0c\u523a\u6fc0\u573a\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u4e14\u590d\u6742\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728DBS\u5bfc\u8054\u8ddd\u79bb\u8f83\u8fd1\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0cVTA\u4e0d\u80fd\u5355\u72ec\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u5c40\u5efa\u6a21\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u53cd\u6620\u7535\u573a\u4ea4\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

Notable examples include brain connectivity networks collected across multiple patients or trade networks between countries collected across multiple goods. Existing statistical approaches to such data typically focus on modeling the structure shared by all networks; some go further by accounting for individual, layer-specific variation. However, real-world multilayer networks often exhibit additional patterns shared only within certain subsets of layers, which can represent treatment and control groups, or patients grouped by a specific trait. Identifying these group-level structures can uncover systematic differences between groups of networks and influence many downstream tasks, such as testing and low-dimensional visualization. To address this gap, we introduce the GroupMultiNeSS model, which enables the simultaneous extraction of shared, group-specific, and individual latent structures from a sample of networks on a shared node set. For this model, we establish identifiability, develop a fitting procedure using convex optimization in combination with a nuclear norm penalty, and prove a guarantee of recovery for the latent positions as long as there is sufficient separation between the shared, group-specific, and individual latent subspaces. We compare the model with MultiNeSS and other models for multiplex networks in various synthetic scenarios and observe an apparent improvement in the modeling accuracy when the group component is accounted for.

This paper draws on mixed-method surveys and a focused literature review to examine student motivations, ethical dilemmas, gendered responses, and institutional readiness for AI adoption. We find that 92% of students use AI tools primarily to save time and improve work quality, yet only 36% receive formal guidance, producing a de facto \"shadow pedagogy\" of unguided workflows. Notably, 18% of students reported integrating AI-constructed material into assignments, which suggests confusion about integrity expectations and compromises the integrity of the assessment. Female students expressed greater concern about abuse and distortion of information than male students, revealing a gendered difference in awareness of risk and AI literacies. Correspondingly, 72% of educators use AI, but only 14% feel at ease doing so, reflecting limited training and uneven policy responses. We argue that institutions must adopt comprehensive AI literacy programs that integrate technical skills and ethical reasoning, alongside clear AI-use policies and assessment practices that promote transparency.

While prior surveys focus on efficiency by examining how to shorten reasoning chains or reduce computation, this view overlooks a fundamental challenge: current LLMs apply uniform reasoning strategies regardless of task complexity, generating long traces for trivial problems while failing to extend reasoning for difficult tasks. This survey reframes reasoning through the lens of {adaptivity}: the capability to allocate reasoning effort based on input characteristics such as difficulty and uncertainty. We make three contributions. First, we formalize deductive, inductive, and abductive reasoning within the LLM context, connecting these classical cognitive paradigms with their algorithmic realizations. Second, we formalize adaptive reasoning as a control-augmented policy optimization problem balancing task performance with computational cost, distinguishing learned policies from inference-time control mechanisms. Third, we propose a systematic taxonomy organizing existing methods into training-based approaches that internalize adaptivity through reinforcement learning, supervised fine-tuning, and learned controllers, and training-free approaches that achieve adaptivity through prompt conditioning, feedback-driven halting, and modular composition. This framework clarifies how different mechanisms realize adaptive reasoning in practice and enables systematic comparison across diverse strategies.

Yet, applying DT to deformation-based metal forming remains challenging because of the strongly coupled spatial-temporal behavior and the nonlinear relationship between toolpath and material response. For instance, sheet-metal forming by the English wheel, a highly flexible but artisan-dependent process, still lacks digital counterparts that can autonomously plan and adapt forming strategies. This study presents an adaptive DT framework that integrates Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) for physics-aware dimensionality reduction with a Koopman operator for representing nonlinear system in a linear lifted space for the real-time decision-making via model predictive control (MPC). To accommodate evolving process conditions or material states, an online Recursive Least Squares (RLS) algorithm is introduced to update the operator coefficients in real time, enabling continuous adaptation of the DT model as new deformation data become available. The proposed framework is experimentally demonstrated on a robotic English Wheel sheet metal forming system, where deformation fields are measured and modeled under varying toolpaths. Results show that the adaptive DT is capable of controlling the forming process to achieve the given target shape by effectively capturing non-stationary process behaviors. Beyond this case study, the proposed framework establishes a generalizable approach for interpretable, adaptive, and computationally-efficient DT of nonlinear manufacturing systems, bridging reduced-order physics representations with data-driven adaptability to support autonomous process control and optimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u7269\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u964d\u7ef4\u4e0eKoopman\u7b97\u5b50\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u91d1\u5c5e\u6210\u5f62\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u51b3\u7b56\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u6280\u672f\u5728\u5236\u9020\u4e1a\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u5e7f\u6cdb\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u4e8e\u53d8\u5f62\u91d1\u5c5e\u6210\u5f62\u7b49\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\u65f6\u7a7a\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u50cf\u82f1\u5f0f\u8f6e\u6210\u5f62\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u5de5\u827a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u4e3b\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6210\u5f62\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u5bf9\u5e94\u7269\u3002", "method": "\u96c6\u6210Proper Orthogonal Decomposition\u8fdb\u884c\u7269\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u964d\u7ef4\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Koopman\u7b97\u5b50\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u7ebf\u6027\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8868\u793a\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u65f6\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u5728\u7ebf\u9012\u5f52\u6700\u5c0f\u4e8c\u4e58\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u65f6\u66f4\u65b0\u7b97\u5b50\u7cfb\u6570\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u8fc7\u7a0b\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u82f1\u5f0f\u8f6e\u677f\u91d1\u6210\u5f62\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u6355\u83b7\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u8fc7\u7a0b\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u63a7\u5236\u6210\u5f62\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8fbe\u5230\u7ed9\u5b9a\u76ee\u6807\u5f62\u72b6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5236\u9020\u7cfb\u7edf\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u7684\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u964d\u9636\u7269\u7406\u8868\u793a\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u81ea\u4e3b\u8fc7\u7a0b\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u3002"}}

A learning model based on self-awareness, types, functions, structured drawing and formal diagrams addresses the weaknesses of drill and practice and the pitfalls of statistical prediction with Large Language Models.\n  In other words, we build mathematics/informatics education on the activity of a professional mathematician in mathematical modelling and designing programs. This tradition emphasises the role of dialogue and doing mathematics. In the Language/Action approach the teacher designs mathematising situations that scaffold previously encountered, or not-known-how-to-solve problems for the learner while teachers and teacher/interlocutors supervise the process.\n  A critical feature is the written-oral dialogue between the learner and the teacher. As a rule, this is 1 to 1 communication. The role of the teacher/interlocutor, a more knowledgeable other, is mostly performed by a more senior student, 1 per 5 to 7 pupils. After Doug Engelbart we propose the metaphor of human intellect augmented by digital technologies such as interactive development environments or AI. Every human has their bio and digital parts. The bio part of the learner reacts to their work through dialogue in the mind.

Traditional approaches rely on analytically derived Lyapunov functions, which are often conservative and challenging to construct for high-dimensional or highly nonlinear systems. In this work, we propose a data-driven framework for learning and verifying RoA estimates for nonlinear systems using neural-network-based Lyapunov functions. Our method employs a composite Lyapunov function that combines a quadratic term with a neural-network-based component, providing both structure and flexibility. We introduce a novel homogeneous loss function for training, which removes the imbalance typically caused by the two non-homogeneous Lyapunov conditions. Together, these two aspects enable efficient training of the Lyapunov candidate. To guarantee the correctness of the learned Lyapunov function, we employ a Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solver to formally verify the stability results. Lastly, we perform a deeper analysis near the origin to overcome numerical artifacts, ensuring strict asymptotic stability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on benchmark nonlinear systems, showing that it significantly reduces conservatism compared to traditional Lyapunov methods while maintaining verifiability. This framework bridges the gap between function approximation and stability certification, paving the way for scalable safety analysis in learning-based control and safety-critical applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684Lyapunov\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4f30\u8ba1\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5438\u5f15\u57df\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u590d\u5408Lyapunov\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u540c\u8d28\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528SMT\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u89e3\u6790Lyapunov\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u4e8e\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6216\u9ad8\u5ea6\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f80\u5f80\u4fdd\u5b88\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u6784\u9020\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u4e14\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u590d\u5408Lyapunov\u51fd\u6570\uff08\u4e8c\u6b21\u9879+\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff09\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u540c\u8d28\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u89e3\u51b3\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u91c7\u7528SMT\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u539f\u70b9\u9644\u8fd1\u8fdb\u884c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u786e\u4fdd\u4e25\u683c\u6e10\u8fd1\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edfLyapunov\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u4fdd\u5b88\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5f25\u5408\u4e86\u51fd\u6570\u903c\u8fd1\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u8ba4\u8bc1\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5b89\u5168\u5206\u6790\u94fa\u5e73\u4e86\u9053\u8def\u3002"}}

We propose HyperComplEx, a hybrid embedding framework that adaptively combines hyperbolic, complex, and Euclidean spaces via learned attention mechanisms. A relation-specific space weighting strategy dynamically selects optimal geometries for each relation type, while a multi-space consistency loss ensures coherent predictions across spaces. We evaluate HyperComplEx on computer science research knowledge graphs ranging from 1K papers (~25K triples) to 10M papers (~45M triples), demonstrating consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines including TransE, RotatE, DistMult, ComplEx, SEPA, and UltraE. Additional tests on standard benchmarks confirm significantly higher results than all baselines. On the 10M-paper dataset, HyperComplEx achieves 0.612 MRR, a 4.8% relative gain over the best baseline, while maintaining efficient training, achieving 85 ms inference per triple. The model scales near-linearly with graph size through adaptive dimension allocation.

Prior approaches typically fall into two extremes -- either learning the entire task or relying on privileged information and hand-designed planners -- both of which struggle to handle diverse objects in long-horizon tasks. To address these challenges, we present a unified framework for collaborative multi-robot, multi-object non-prehensile manipulation that integrates flow-matching co-generation with anonymous multi-robot motion planning. Within this framework, a generative model co-generates contact formations and manipulation trajectories from visual observations, while a novel motion planner conveys robots at scale. Crucially, the same planner also supports coordination at the object level, assigning manipulated objects to larger target structures and thereby unifying robot- and object-level reasoning within a single algorithmic framework. Experiments in challenging simulated environments demonstrate that our approach outperforms baselines in both motion planning and manipulation tasks, highlighting the benefits of generative co-design and integrated planning for scaling collaborative manipulation to complex multi-agent, multi-object settings.

Central to this innovation is the ``the one-step policy'' network, which is optimized through a $Q$-function that is regularized with the behavioral cloning from expert trajectories, allowing learning more expressive policies using flow-based generative models. In this paper, we studied the convergence property and stabilizablity of the one-step policy during learning for linear quadratic problems under the offline settings. Our theoretical results are based on a new formulation of the one-step policy loss based on the average expected cost, and regularized with the behavioral cloning loss. Such a formulation allows us to tap into existing strong theoretical results from the policy gradient theorem to study the convergence properties of the one-step policy.

Phase I generates natural-language crash reconstructions from multimodal inputs. Phase II performs in-depth crash reasoning by combining these reconstructions with temporal Event Data Recorder (EDR).For validation, we applied it to all LVD cases, focusing on a subset of 39 complex crashes where multiple EDR records per collision introduced ambiguity (e.g., due to missing or conflicting data).The evaluation of the 39 LVD crash cases revealed our framework achieved perfect accuracy across all test cases, successfully identifying both the most relevant EDR event and correctly distinguishing striking versus struck vehicles, surpassing the 92% accuracy achieved by human researchers on the same challenging dataset.

This requires relatively heavy equipment for insertion, which is problematic for anchoring in hard-to-access sites, including in extraterrestrial locations. In contrast, for tree roots, the external reaction force required to extract is much greater than required to insert--little more than the weight of the seed initiates insertion. This is partly due to the mechanism by which roots insert into the ground: tip extension. Proof-of-concept robotic prototypes have shown the benefits of using this mechanism, but a rigorous understanding of the underlying granular mechanics and how they inform the design of a robotic anchor is lacking. Here, we study the terradynamics of tip-extending anchors compared to traditional piling-like intruders, develop a set of design insights, and apply these to create a deployable robotic anchor. Specifically, we identify that to increase an anchor's ratio of extraction force to insertion force, it should: (i) extend beyond a critical depth; (ii) include hair-like protrusions; (iii) extend near-vertically, and (iv) incorporate multiple smaller anchors rather than a single large anchor. Synthesizing these insights, we developed a lightweight, soft robotic, root-inspired anchoring device that inserts into the ground with a reaction force less than its weight. We demonstrate that the 300 g device can deploy a series of temperature sensors 45 cm deep into loose Martian regolith simulant while anchoring with an average of 120 N, resulting in an anchoring-to-weight ratio of 40:1.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53d7\u6811\u6839\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u5c16\u7aef\u5ef6\u4f38\u951a\u56fa\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8f6f\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u951a\u56fa\u88c5\u7f6e\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u677e\u6563\u7684\u706b\u661f\u571f\u58e4\u6a21\u62df\u7269\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b040:1\u7684\u951a\u56fa\u91cd\u91cf\u6bd4\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6869\u57fa\u9700\u8981\u6bd4\u62d4\u51fa\u963b\u529b\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u63d2\u5165\u529b\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5728\u96be\u4ee5\u5230\u8fbe\u5730\u70b9\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u5916\u661f\u73af\u5883\uff09\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u800c\u6811\u6839\u901a\u8fc7\u5c16\u7aef\u5ef6\u4f38\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u79cd\u5b50\u91cd\u91cf\u5373\u53ef\u63d2\u5165\uff0c\u62d4\u51fa\u963b\u529b\u5374\u8fdc\u5927\u4e8e\u63d2\u5165\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u5c16\u7aef\u5ef6\u4f38\u951a\u56fa\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u6869\u57fa\u4fb5\u5165\u7684\u571f\u58e4\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\uff1a\u8fbe\u5230\u4e34\u754c\u6df1\u5ea6\u3001\u5305\u542b\u6bdb\u53d1\u72b6\u7a81\u8d77\u3001\u8fd1\u5782\u76f4\u5ef6\u4f38\u3001\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u4e2a\u5c0f\u951a\u800c\u975e\u5355\u4e2a\u5927\u951a\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u539f\u5219\u5f00\u53d1\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8f6f\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u951a\u56fa\u88c5\u7f6e\u3002", "result": "\u5f00\u53d1\u51fa300\u514b\u7684\u951a\u56fa\u88c5\u7f6e\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u677e\u6563\u706b\u661f\u571f\u58e4\u6a21\u62df\u7269\u4e2d\u63d2\u516545\u5398\u7c73\u6df1\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u951a\u56fa\u529b\u8fbe120N\uff0c\u951a\u56fa\u91cd\u91cf\u6bd4\u4e3a40:1\uff0c\u63d2\u5165\u53cd\u5e94\u529b\u5c0f\u4e8e\u5176\u81ea\u8eab\u91cd\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c16\u7aef\u5ef6\u4f38\u673a\u5236\u7ed3\u5408\u5173\u952e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u951a\u56fa\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4e3a\u96be\u4ee5\u5230\u8fbe\u73af\u5883\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u5916\u661f\u73af\u5883\uff09\u7684\u951a\u56fa\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u521b\u65b0\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Key open challenges are analyzed, including the need for more accurate degradation modeling, effective management of multi-stack systems, and advancements in the currently underdeveloped action phase, in which diagnostic and prognostic insights are translated into real-time system responses, such as dynamic load derating, thermal-management adjustments, or automated maintenance triggers, to prevent failures and extend PEFC life. While notable strides have been made in recent years in diagnostics and remaining useful life estimation, it remains challenging to seamlessly integrate these insights into actionable strategies. Future directions highlight the need to address data scarcity and advance interdisciplinary research. Key focus areas include sensor integration, artificial intelligence, and digital twins.

We demonstrate the capabilities of the platform through a case study on the flooding-related risk in Jacksonville, Florida, showing how it allows users to explore, generate, and evaluate regionalization interactively, combining computational rigor with user-driven decision making.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u667a\u80fdAI\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u9762\u5411\u707e\u5bb3\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u5355\u5143\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4eba\u7c7b\u53c2\u4e0e\u5faa\u73af\u786e\u4fdd\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u5355\u5143\uff08\u5982\u4eba\u53e3\u666e\u67e5\u533a\u3001\u90ae\u653f\u7f16\u7801\u533a\uff09\u65e0\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u53cd\u6620\u5f53\u5730\u793e\u533a\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5e94\u5bf9\u707e\u5bb3\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u81ea\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5730\u56fe\uff08RepSC-SOM\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5730\u7406\u8fc7\u6ee4\u548c\u533a\u57df\u589e\u957f\u7ec6\u5316\uff0cAI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u901a\u8fc7\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u884c\u52a8\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u6574\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4f5b\u7f57\u91cc\u8fbe\u5dde\u6770\u514b\u900a\u7ef4\u5c14\u5e02\u7684\u6d2a\u6c34\u98ce\u9669\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5e73\u53f0\u80fd\u591f\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u63a2\u7d22\u3001\u751f\u6210\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u533a\u57df\u5212\u5206\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5e73\u53f0\u5c06\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u9a71\u52a8\u51b3\u7b56\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4e3a\u707e\u5bb3\u89c4\u5212\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u533a\u57df\u5212\u5206\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

To address this challenge, we present a hand-agnostic manipulation transfer system. It efficiently converts human hand manipulation sequences from demonstration videos into high-quality dexterous manipulation trajectories without requirements of massive training data. To tackle the multi-dimensional disparities between human hands and dexterous hands, as well as the challenges posed by high-degree-of-freedom coordinated control of dexterous hands, we design a progressive transfer framework: first, we establish primary control signals for dexterous hands based on kinematic matching; subsequently, we train residual policies with action space rescaling and thumb-guided initialization to dynamically optimize contact interactions under unified rewards; finally, we compute wrist control trajectories with the objective of preserving operational semantics. Using only human hand manipulation videos, our system automatically configures system parameters for different tasks, balancing kinematic matching and dynamic optimization across dexterous hands, object categories, and tasks. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our framework can automatically generate smooth and semantically correct dexterous hand manipulation that faithfully reproduces human intentions, achieving high efficiency and strong generalizability with an average transfer success rate of 73%, providing an easily implementable and scalable method for collecting robot dexterous manipulation data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u624b\u90e8\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u64cd\u7eb5\u8f6c\u79fb\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5c06\u4eba\u7c7b\u624b\u90e8\u64cd\u7eb5\u89c6\u9891\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u591a\u6307\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u624b\u64cd\u7eb5\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5927\u91cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u6307\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u624b\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6307\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u624b\u786c\u4ef6\u5e73\u53f0\u6536\u96c6\u64cd\u7eb5\u6570\u636e\u5b58\u5728\u56fa\u6709\u56f0\u96be\u548c\u6709\u9650\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7075\u5de7\u64cd\u7eb5\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u8f6c\u79fb\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u5339\u914d\u5efa\u7acb\u591a\u6307\u624b\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u63a7\u5236\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1b\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u91cd\u7f29\u653e\u548c\u62c7\u6307\u5f15\u5bfc\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u6b8b\u5dee\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u52a8\u6001\u4f18\u5316\u63a5\u89e6\u4ea4\u4e92\uff1b\u6700\u540e\u8ba1\u7b97\u624b\u8155\u63a7\u5236\u8f68\u8ff9\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u64cd\u4f5c\u8bed\u4e49\u3002", "result": "\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u4eba\u7c7b\u624b\u90e8\u64cd\u7eb5\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u81ea\u52a8\u914d\u7f6e\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u5339\u914d\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u4f18\u5316\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u5e73\u6ed1\u4e14\u8bed\u4e49\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u591a\u6307\u624b\u64cd\u7eb5\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u8f6c\u79fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u8fbe73%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6613\u4e8e\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u6536\u96c6\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7075\u5de7\u64cd\u7eb5\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u548c\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

For example, pathophysiological models of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) typically describe how variables, such as regional levels of toxic proteins, interact spatiotemporally within a dynamical system driven by an underlying biological substrate, often based on brain connectivity. However, current methods grossly oversimplify the complex relationship between brain connectivity by assuming a single-modality brain connectome as the disease-spreading substrate. This leads to inaccurate predictions of pathology spread, especially during the long-term progression period. Meanhwile, other methods of learning such a graph in a purely data-driven way face the identifiability issue due to lack of proper constraint. We thus present a novel framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) as expert guides on the interaction of regional variables to enhance learning of disease progression from irregularly sampled longitudinal patient data. By leveraging LLMs' ability to synthesize multi-modal relationships and incorporate diverse disease-driving mechanisms, our method simultaneously optimizes 1) the construction of long-term disease trajectories from individual-level observations and 2) the biologically-constrained graph structure that captures interactions among brain regions with better identifiability. We demonstrate the new approach by estimating the pathology propagation using tau-PET imaging data from an Alzheimer's disease cohort.

Deciding when and where each individual robot must move is a computationally complex problem. The challenge is further exacerbated by difficulties inherent to physical systems, such as measurement error and control dynamics. Thus, how to best determine the optimal path for each robot, when moving from one configuration to another, and how to best perform such determination and effect corresponding motion remains an open problem.

In contrast, world models that capture environmental dynamics in latent space have opened up new perspectives for navigation tasks, enabling systems to move beyond traditional multi-module pipelines. However, world model often suffers from high computational costs in both training and inference. To address this, we propose LS-NWM - a lightweight latent space navigation world model that is trained and operates entirely in latent space, compared to the state-of-the-art baseline, our method reduces training time by approximately 3.2x and planning time by about 447x,while further improving navigation performance with a 35% higher SR and an 11% higher SPL. The key idea is that accurate pixel-wise environmental prediction is unnecessary for navigation. Instead, the model predicts future latent states based on current observational features and action inputs, then performs path planning and decision-making within this compact representation, significantly improving computational efficiency. By incorporating an autoregressive multi-frame prediction strategy during training, the model effectively captures long-term spatiotemporal dependencies, thereby enhancing navigation performance in complex scenarios.

However, monitoring is still often performed manually due to the lack of suitable algorithmic methods and data. This paper introduces a high-fidelity, physics-enhanced simulator of a three-pump wastewater station that captures transient hydro-mechanical dynamics at a one-second resolution. The simulator is fully parameter-driven, adaptable to other wastewater stations, and capable of generating datasets for data-driven analytics. It can also generate balanced faulty datasets when real failures are scarce or confidential. A comparison with high-frequency SCADA data from a municipal station shows strong agreement across key operational metrics. Furthermore, the paper proposes robust statistical and mathematical frameworks for fault detection and isolation, including a nested-model F-test to detect pump degradation or system faults, and a tangent residual approach to distinguish pump faults from system faults using operating-point kinematics. This framework enables what-if studies, facilitates early fault diagnosis based on flow rate and head, and provides actionable insights for condition-based maintenance in wastewater pumping infrastructure.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684\u6c61\u6c34\u6cf5\u7ad9\u7269\u7406\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u62df\u5668\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u6545\u969c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u4e8e\u6545\u969c\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u9694\u79bb\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e0e\u6570\u5b66\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u6c61\u6c34\u6cf5\u7ad9\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u9700\u8981\u76d1\u63a7\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5408\u9002\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u76d1\u63a7\u4ecd\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53c2\u6570\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4e09\u6cf5\u6c61\u6c34\u7ad9\u6a21\u62df\u5668\uff0c\u6355\u6349\u77ac\u6001\u6d41\u4f53\u529b\u5b66\u52a8\u6001\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5d4c\u5957\u6a21\u578bF\u68c0\u9a8c\u68c0\u6d4b\u6cf5\u9000\u5316\u6216\u7cfb\u7edf\u6545\u969c\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5207\u7ebf\u6b8b\u5dee\u65b9\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u6cf5\u6545\u969c\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6545\u969c\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u5e02\u653f\u7ad9\u9ad8\u9891SCADA\u6570\u636e\u6bd4\u8f83\u663e\u793a\u5173\u952e\u8fd0\u884c\u6307\u6807\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\uff1b\u6846\u67b6\u652f\u6301\u5047\u8bbe\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u91cf\u548c\u626c\u7a0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e9\u671f\u6545\u969c\u8bca\u65ad\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u548c\u6545\u969c\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u6c61\u6c34\u6cf5\u9001\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u7ef4\u62a4\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u7a00\u7f3a\u6216\u673a\u5bc6\u7684\u6545\u969c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u5206\u6790\u3002"}}

Despite extensive training, these systems will inevitably encounter scenarios where no available course of action fully satisfies all operational constraints (e.g., operating procedures, rules, laws, norms, and goals). To achieve goals in accordance with human expectations and values, agents must go beyond their trained policies and instead construct, evaluate, and justify candidate courses of action. These processes require contextual \"knowledge\" that may lie outside prior (policy) training. This paper characterizes requirements for agent decision making in these contexts. It also identifies the types of knowledge agents require to make decisions robust to agent goals and aligned with human expectations. Drawing on both analysis and empirical case studies, we examine how agents need to integrate normative, pragmatic, and situational understanding to select and then to pursue more aligned courses of action in complex, real-world environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u81ea\u4e3bAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u9047\u5230\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u672a\u8986\u76d6\u7684\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u65f6\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u6784\u5efa\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u8bc1\u660e\u5019\u9009\u884c\u52a8\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u4eba\u7c7b\u671f\u671b\u548c\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u4e3bAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u5fc5\u7136\u4f1a\u9047\u5230\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u672a\u8986\u76d6\u7684\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8d85\u8d8a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u884c\u52a8\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4ee5\u7b26\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u671f\u671b\u548c\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5982\u4f55\u6574\u5408\u89c4\u8303\u6027\u3001\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u548c\u60c5\u5883\u6027\u7406\u89e3\u6765\u9009\u62e9\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u671f\u671b\u7684\u884c\u52a8\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u505a\u51fa\u7a33\u5065\u51b3\u7b56\u6240\u9700\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u89c4\u8303\u6027\u77e5\u8bc6\u3001\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u60c5\u5883\u6027\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u4e3bAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u8981\u8d85\u8d8a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u591a\u79cd\u77e5\u8bc6\u7c7b\u578b\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u884c\u52a8\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u624d\u80fd\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73b0\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u505a\u51fa\u7b26\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u671f\u671b\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u3002"}}

However, enabling a unified framework that generalizes across different tasks, objects, and environments while seamlessly integrating non-prehensile and prehensile (P) actions remains challenging: robots must determine when to invoke NP skills, select the appropriate primitive for each context, and compose P and NP strategies into robust, multi-step plans. We introduce ApaptPNP, a vision-language model (VLM)-empowered task and motion planning framework that systematically selects and combines P and NP skills to accomplish diverse manipulation objectives. Our approach leverages a VLM to interpret visual scene observations and textual task descriptions, generating a high-level plan skeleton that prescribes the sequence and coordination of P and NP actions. A digital-twin based object-centric intermediate layer predicts desired object poses, enabling proactive mental rehearsal of manipulation sequences. Finally, a control module synthesizes low-level robot commands, with continuous execution feedback enabling online task plan refinement and adaptive replanning through the VLM. We evaluate ApaptPNP across representative P&NP hybrid manipulation tasks in both simulation and real-world environments. These results underscore the potential of hybrid P&NP manipulation as a crucial step toward general-purpose, human-level robotic manipulation capabilities.

Using high-level modelling languages such as Essence, a modeller may express their problems in terms of abstract structures. These are structures not natively supported by the solvers, and so they have to be transformed into or represented as other structures before solving. For example, nested sets are abstract structures, and they can be represented as matrices in constraint solvers. Many problems contain symmetries and one very common and highly successful technique used in constraint programming is to \"break\" symmetries, to avoid searching for symmetric solutions. This can speed up the solving process by many orders of magnitude. Most of these symmetry-breaking techniques involve placing some kind of ordering for the variables of the problem, and picking a particular member under the symmetries, usually the smallest. Unfortunately, applying this technique to abstract variables produces a very large number of complex constraints that perform poorly in practice. In this paper, we demonstrate a new incomplete method of breaking the symmetries of abstract structures by better exploiting their representations. We apply the method in breaking the symmetries arising from indistinguishable objects, a commonly occurring type of symmetry, and show that our method is faster than the previous methods proposed in (Akg\u00fcn et al. 2025).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u6253\u7834\u62bd\u8c61\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5229\u7528\u5176\u8868\u793a\u6765\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u53ef\u533a\u5206\u5bf9\u8c61\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u901f\u5ea6\u66f4\u5feb\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u7ea6\u675f\u7f16\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u62bd\u8c61\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u5982\u5d4c\u5957\u96c6\u5408\uff09\u9700\u8981\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u652f\u6301\u7684\u8868\u793a\u5f62\u5f0f\u3002\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7834\u574f\u6280\u672f\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u6c42\u89e3\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4f46\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u62bd\u8c61\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u5927\u91cf\u590d\u6742\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5b9e\u9645\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7834\u574f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5229\u7528\u62bd\u8c61\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u8868\u793a\u6765\u6253\u7834\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9488\u5bf9\u4e0d\u53ef\u533a\u5206\u5bf9\u8c61\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4(Akg\u00fcn et al. 2025)\u4e2d\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u901f\u5ea6\u66f4\u5feb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u62bd\u8c61\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u8868\u793a\u5229\u7528\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7834\u574f\u5728\u62bd\u8c61\u53d8\u91cf\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u7ea6\u675f\u7f16\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5904\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Yet the real world is dynamic, quasi-static interactions are insufficient to cope with the various environmental conditions. As a step toward more dynamic interaction scenario, we present a reinforcement-learning-based training pipeline that produces a unified whole-body controller for humanoid badminton, enabling coordinated lower-body footwork and upper-body striking without any motion priors or expert demonstrations. Training follows a three-stage curriculum: first footwork acquisition, then precision-guided racket swing generation, and finally task-focused refinement, yielding motions in which both legs and arms serve the hitting objective. For deployment, we incorporate an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to estimate and predict shuttlecock trajectories for target striking. We also introduce a prediction-free variant that dispenses with EKF and explicit trajectory prediction. To validate the framework, we conduct five sets of experiment in both simulation and the real world. In simulation, two robots sustain a rally of 21 consecutive hits. Moreover, the prediction-free variant achieves successful hits with comparable performance relative to the target-known policy. In real-world tests, both the prediction and controller module exhibit high accuracy, and on-court hitting achieves an outgoing shuttle speed up to 10 m/s with a mean return landing distance of 3.5 m.

Most existing studies evaluate these algorithms under the assumption of homogeneous platoons, i.e., when all platoon members adopt the same CACC. However, market competition is likely to result in vehicles from different manufacturers implementing distinct CACCs. This raises fundamental questions about whether heterogeneous vehicles can safely cooperate within a platoon and what performance can be achieved. To date, these questions have received little attention, as heterogeneous platoons are difficult to model and analyze. In this work, we introduce the concept of mixed platoons, i.e., platoons made of vehicles running heterogeneous CACCs, and we study their performance through simulation-based experiments. We consider mixtures of three well-established CACCs from the literature. In the first part of the paper, we study a single mixed platoon in isolation to understand the microscopic effects on safety: we evaluate the performance of various CACC-mixtures across speed change and emergency braking scenarios. In the second part, we examine a high-density ring-road scenario to assess macroscopic impacts on safety, comfort, and traffic throughput, especially comparing throughput results with those obtained from vehicles controlled by a standard Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) or by human drivers. Our findings highlight that some combinations of CACCs can operate robustly and safely, while others exhibit critical limitations in safety, comfort, or efficiency. These results emphasize the need for careful system design and the development of theoretical frameworks for modeling heterogeneous platoons.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u7531\u4e0d\u540c\u5236\u9020\u5546CACC\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ec4\u6210\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u8f66\u8f86\u7f16\u961f\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5728\u7d27\u6025\u5236\u52a8\u548c\u901f\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u67d0\u4e9bCACC\u7ec4\u5408\u80fd\u5b89\u5168\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u800c\u5176\u4ed6\u7ec4\u5408\u5b58\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u8212\u9002\u6027\u6216\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5173\u952e\u9650\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u591a\u5047\u8bbe\u7f16\u961f\u8f66\u8f86\u91c7\u7528\u76f8\u540c\u7684CACC\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4f46\u5e02\u573a\u7ade\u4e89\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u540c\u5236\u9020\u5546\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u7684CACC\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u5f02\u8d28\u8f66\u8f86\u80fd\u5426\u5728\u7f16\u961f\u4e2d\u5b89\u5168\u534f\u4f5c\u53ca\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4eff\u771f\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7814\u7a76\u6df7\u5408\u7f16\u961f\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u4e09\u79cd\u6210\u719fCACC\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u5206\u6790\u5355\u4e2a\u6df7\u5408\u7f16\u961f\u5728\u901f\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u7d27\u6025\u5236\u52a8\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5fae\u89c2\u5b89\u5168\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u9ad8\u5bc6\u5ea6\u73af\u5f62\u9053\u8def\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5b8f\u89c2\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u8212\u9002\u6027\u548c\u4ea4\u901a\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u67d0\u4e9bCACC\u7ec4\u5408\u80fd\u591f\u7a33\u5065\u5b89\u5168\u5730\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u800c\u5176\u4ed6\u7ec4\u5408\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u8212\u9002\u6027\u6216\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5173\u952e\u9650\u5236\u3002\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6ACC\u6216\u4eba\u7c7b\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u8f66\u8f86\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u9700\u8981\u8c28\u614e\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u5f00\u53d1\u5f02\u8d28\u7f16\u961f\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u6df7\u5408CACC\u7f16\u961f\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, the critical aspect of role allocation strategies remains underexplored. In this study, we demonstrate that allocating roles with differing viewpoints to specific positions significantly impacts MAD's performance in reasoning tasks. Specifically, we find a novel role allocation strategy, \"Truth Last\", which can improve MAD performance by up to 22% in reasoning tasks. To address the issue of unknown truth in practical applications, we propose the Multi-Agent Debate Consistency (MADC) strategy, which systematically simulates and optimizes its core mechanisms. MADC incorporates path consistency to assess agreement among independent roles, simulating the role with the highest consistency score as the truth. We validated MADC across a range of LLMs (9 models), including the DeepSeek-R1 Distilled Models, on challenging reasoning tasks.

The objects that we manipulate, salmon loins, are natural in origin and vary in size and shape, they are limp and deformable with poorly characterized elastoplastic parameters, while also being slippery and hard to hold. The three robots straighten the loin; grasp and hold the knife; cut with the knife in a slicing motion while cooperatively stabilizing the loin during cutting; and pick up the thin slices from the cutting board or knife blade. Our system combines deep reinforcement learning with in-hand tool shape manipulation, in-hand tool cutting, and feedback of visual and tactile information to achieve robustness to the variabilities inherent in this task.

Building on this unified view, we propose the concept of a translation-symmetric market (TSM) framework, in which market-clearing models maintain identical structural forms across all hierarchical levels. We prove that translation symmetry induces an inductive property: once incentive compatibility holds at one level, it propagates downward to the internal settlements between the VPP and its constituent DERs. TSM also preserves service prices across levels, ensuring competitive conditions and enabling transparent valuation of resource contributions. Theoretical analysis and case studies illustrate how TSM secures incentive-compatible profit allocation in aggregating DERs to provide multiple services.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7ffb\u8bd1\u5bf9\u79f0\u5e02\u573a\uff08TSM\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u865a\u62df\u7535\u5382\uff08VPP\uff09\u5728\u805a\u5408\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u80fd\u6e90\u8d44\u6e90\uff08DERs\uff09\u65f6\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u6fc0\u52b1\u517c\u5bb9\u7684\u5229\u6da6\u5206\u914d\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u80fd\u6e90\u8d44\u6e90\u5728\u865a\u62df\u7535\u5382\u4e2d\u5e02\u573a\u529b\u91cf\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5229\u6da6\u5206\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u6fc0\u52b1\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5c06VPP\u7684\u5e02\u573a\u53c2\u4e0e\u3001\u5185\u90e8\u8fd0\u8425\u548c\u5229\u6da6\u5206\u914d\u7edf\u4e00\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5e02\u573a\u6e05\u7b97\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7ffb\u8bd1\u5bf9\u79f0\u5e02\u573a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u5e02\u573a\u6e05\u7b97\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6240\u6709\u5c42\u7ea7\u4fdd\u6301\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5f62\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u7ffb\u8bd1\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5177\u6709\u5f52\u7eb3\u7279\u6027\uff1a\u4e00\u65e6\u5728\u67d0\u4e00\u5c42\u7ea7\u5b9e\u73b0\u6fc0\u52b1\u517c\u5bb9\uff0c\u5c31\u4f1a\u5411\u4e0b\u4f20\u64ad\u5230VPP\u4e0e\u5176\u7ec4\u6210DERs\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u7ed3\u7b97\u4e2d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u670d\u52a1\u4ef7\u683c\u5728\u5404\u5c42\u7ea7\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "TSM\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u786e\u4fdd\u5728\u805a\u5408DERs\u63d0\u4f9b\u591a\u79cd\u670d\u52a1\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u6fc0\u52b1\u517c\u5bb9\u7684\u5229\u6da6\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u6761\u4ef6\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d44\u6e90\u8d21\u732e\u7684\u900f\u660e\u4f30\u503c\u3002"}}

Here we propose Differentiable Simulation for Search (DSS), a framework that leverages the differentiable simulator Waymax as both a next state predictor and a critic. It relies on the simulator's hardcoded dynamics, making state predictions highly accurate, while utilizing the simulator's differentiability to effectively search across action sequences.

Conformal Prediction for Interactive Multi-Agent Systems", "comment": null, "summary": "Uncertainty-aware prediction is essential for safe motion planning, especially when using learned models to forecast the behavior of surrounding agents. Conformal prediction is a statistical tool often used to produce uncertainty-aware prediction regions for machine learning models. Most existing frameworks utilizing conformal prediction-based uncertainty predictions assume that the surrounding agents are non-interactive. This is because in closed-loop, as uncertainty-aware agents change their behavior to account for prediction uncertainty, the surrounding agents respond to this change, leading to a distribution shift which we call endogenous distribution shift. To address this challenge, we introduce an iterative conformal prediction framework that systematically adapts the uncertainty-aware ego-agent controller to the endogenous distribution shift. The proposed method provides probabilistic safety guarantees while adapting to the evolving behavior of reactive, non-ego agents. We establish a model for the endogenous distribution shift and provide the conditions for the iterative conformal prediction pipeline to converge under such a distribution shift.

ARCTraj addresses this gap by recording temporally ordered, object-level actions that capture how humans iteratively transform inputs into outputs, revealing intermediate reasoning steps that conventional datasets overlook. Collected via the O2ARC web interface, it contains around 10,000 trajectories annotated with task identifiers, timestamps, and success labels across 400 training tasks from the ARC-AGI-1 benchmark. It further defines a unified reasoning pipeline encompassing data collection, action abstraction, Markov decision process (MDP) formulation, and downstream learning, enabling integration with reinforcement learning, generative modeling, and sequence modeling methods such as PPO, World Models, GFlowNets, Diffusion agents, and Decision Transformers. Analyses of spatial selection, color attribution, and strategic convergence highlight the structure and diversity of human reasoning.

In contrast, vision-based tactile sensors in robotics have been limited to simple planar geometries, with biomorphic designs remaining underexplored. To address this gap, we present SimTac, a physics-based simulation framework for the design and validation of biomorphic tactile sensors. SimTac consists of particle-based deformation modeling, light-field rendering for photorealistic tactile image generation, and a neural network for predicting mechanical responses, enabling accurate and efficient simulation across a wide range of geometries and materials. We demonstrate the versatility of SimTac by designing and validating physical sensor prototypes inspired by biological tactile structures and further demonstrate its effectiveness across multiple Sim2Real tactile tasks, including object classification, slip detection, and contact safety assessment. Our framework bridges the gap between bio-inspired design and practical realisation, expanding the design space of tactile sensors and paving the way for tactile sensing systems that integrate morphology and sensing to enable robust interaction in unstructured environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "SimTac\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4eff\u751f\u89e6\u89c9\u4f20\u611f\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7c92\u5b50\u53d8\u5f62\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u5149\u573a\u6e32\u67d3\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u9884\u6d4b\u673a\u68b0\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u79cd\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u548c\u6750\u6599\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u7269\u89e6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u5f62\u6001\u7ed3\u6784\u5bc6\u5207\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u800c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u89c6\u89c9\u89e6\u89c9\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u7b80\u5355\u5e73\u9762\u51e0\u4f55\uff0c\u4eff\u751f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7c92\u5b50\u53d8\u5f62\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u5149\u573a\u6e32\u67d3\u751f\u6210\u903c\u771f\u89e6\u89c9\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u9884\u6d4b\u673a\u68b0\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u548c\u6750\u6599\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u9ad8\u6548\u4eff\u771f\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4eff\u751f\u89e6\u89c9\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u539f\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2aSim2Real\u89e6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7269\u4f53\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u6ed1\u52a8\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u63a5\u89e6\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "conclusion": "SimTac\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u4eff\u751f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u89e6\u89c9\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4e3a\u5728\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u89e6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u94fa\u5e73\u9053\u8def\u3002"}}

To bridge this gap, we propose that geometric construction provides an ideal testbed as it inherently demands a fusion of language comprehension and precise visual generation. We introduce GGBench, a benchmark designed specifically to evaluate geometric generative reasoning. It provides a comprehensive framework for systematically diagnosing a model's ability to not only understand and reason but to actively construct a solution, thereby setting a more rigorous standard for the next generation of intelligent systems.

In these non-Markovian settings, key decision cues are often hidden in object-specific histories rather than the current scene. Without persistent memory of prior interactions (what has been interacted with, where it has been, or how it has changed) visuomotor policies may fail, repeat past actions, or overlook completed ones. To surface this challenge, we introduce LIBERO-Mem, a non-Markovian task suite for stress-testing robotic manipulation under object-level partial observability. It combines short- and long-horizon object tracking with temporally sequenced subgoals, requiring reasoning beyond the current frame. However, vision-language-action (VLA) models often struggle in such settings, with token scaling quickly becoming intractable even for tasks spanning just a few hundred frames. We propose Embodied-SlotSSM, a slot-centric VLA framework built for temporal scalability. It maintains spatio-temporally consistent slot identities and leverages them through two mechanisms: (1) slot-state-space modeling for reconstructing short-term history, and (2) a relational encoder to align the input tokens with action decoding. Together, these components enable temporally grounded, context-aware action prediction.

Although the Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) paradigm offers a promising solution by promoting consensus among multiple agents to enhance reliability, it relies on the unrealistic assumption that all debaters are rational and reflective, which is a condition that may not hold when agents themselves are prone to hallucinations. To address this gap, we introduce the Multi-agent Undercover Gaming (MUG) protocol, inspired by social deduction games like \"Who is Undercover?\". MUG reframes MAD as a process of detecting \"undercover\" agents (those suffering from hallucinations) by employing multimodal counterfactual tests. Specifically, we modify reference images to introduce counterfactual evidence and observe whether agents can accurately identify these changes, providing ground-truth for identifying hallucinating agents and enabling robust, crowd-powered multimodal reasoning. MUG advances MAD protocols along three key dimensions: (1) enabling factual verification beyond statistical consensus through counterfactual testing; (2) introducing cross-evidence reasoning via dynamically modified evidence sources instead of relying on static inputs; and (3) fostering active reasoning, where agents engage in probing discussions rather than passively answering questions.

While recent progress has shown promising results, they still suffer from two key limitations: (i) the reasoning processes lack the depth and iterative refinement characteristic of human cognition; and (ii) the reasoning processes exhibit instability, which compromises their reliability in downstream applications. In this work, we present STaR (slow-thinking for table reasoning), a new framework achieving cognitive table reasoning, in which LLMs are equipped with slow-thinking capabilities by explicitly modeling step-by-step thinking and uncertainty-aware inference. During training, STaR employs two-stage difficulty-aware reinforcement learning (DRL), progressively learning from simple to complex queries under a composite reward. During inference, STaR performs trajectory-level uncertainty quantification by integrating token-level confidence and answer consistency, enabling selection of more credible reasoning paths.

To address this, we propose TLV-CoRe, a CLIP-based Tactile-Language-Vision Collaborative Representation learning method.

Additionally, a Unified Bridging Adapter is introduced to enhance tri-modal interaction within the shared representation space. To fairly evaluate the effectiveness of tactile models, we further propose the RSS evaluation framework, focusing on Robustness, Synergy, and Stability across different methods.

Workshop website: https://sites.google.com/rice.edu/parallelized-planning-control/", "summary": "Coverage motion planning is essential to a wide range of robotic tasks. Unlike conventional motion planning problems, which reason over temporal sequences of states, coverage motion planning requires reasoning over the spatial distribution of entire trajectories, making standard motion planning methods limited in computational efficiency and less amenable to modern parallelization frameworks. In this work, we formulate the coverage motion planning problem as a statistical inference problem from the perspective of flow matching, a generative modeling technique that has gained significant attention in recent years. The proposed formulation unifies commonly used statistical discrepancy measures, such as Kullback-Leibler divergence and Sinkhorn divergence, with a standard linear quadratic regulator problem. More importantly, it decouples the generation of trajectory gradients for coverage from the synthesis of control under nonlinear system dynamics, enabling significant acceleration through parallelization on modern computational architectures, particularly Graphics Processing Units (GPUs).

However, evaluating these policies remains difficult because real-world testing is expensive, time-consuming, and labor-intensive. It also requires frequent environment resets and carries safety risks when deploying unproven policies on physical robots. Manually creating and populating simulation environments with assets for robotic manipulation has not addressed these issues, primarily due to the significant engineering effort required and the often substantial sim-to-real gap, both in terms of physics and rendering. In this paper, we explore the use of action-conditional video generation models as a scalable way to learn world models for policy evaluation. We demonstrate how to incorporate action conditioning into existing pre-trained video generation models. This allows leveraging internet-scale in-the-wild online videos during the pre-training stage, and alleviates the need for a large dataset of paired video-action data, which is expensive to collect for robotic manipulation. Our paper examines the effect of dataset diversity, pre-trained weight and common failure cases for the proposed evaluation pipeline.Our experiments demonstrate that, across various metrics, including policy ranking and the correlation between actual policy values and predicted policy values, these models offer a promising approach for evaluating policies without requiring real-world interactions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u52a8\u4f5c\u6761\u4ef6\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4ea4\u4e92\u5373\u53ef\u8fdb\u884c\u7b56\u7565\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u901a\u7528\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b56\u7565\u9762\u4e34\u771f\u5b9e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u73af\u5883\u91cd\u7f6e\u9891\u7e41\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u4eff\u771f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5de5\u7a0b\u91cf\u5927\u548c\u4eff\u771f\u5230\u73b0\u5b9e\u5dee\u8ddd\u5927\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u52a8\u4f5c\u6761\u4ef6\u6574\u5408\u5230\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4e92\u8054\u7f51\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u91ce\u5916\u5728\u7ebf\u89c6\u9891\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u6536\u96c6\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u914d\u5bf9\u89c6\u9891-\u52a8\u4f5c\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u7b56\u7565\u6392\u5e8f\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u7b56\u7565\u503c\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u7b56\u7565\u503c\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u65e0\u9700\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "\u52a8\u4f5c\u6761\u4ef6\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b56\u7565\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5229\u7528\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5728\u7ebf\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u6602\u8d35\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

There is a substantial risk that some of these decision induce harm to people, by infringing their well-being or their fundamental human rights.

This obstructs the ability to trace what went into a decision, which in turn is a prerequisite to any attempt of reconstructing a responsibility chain. Specifically, such traceability is linked to a documentation that will stand up in court when determining the cause of some AI-based decision that inadvertently or intentionally violates the law.\n  This paper takes a radical, yet practical, approach to this problem, by enforcing the documentation of each and every component that goes into the training or inference of an automated decision. As such, it presents the first running workflow supporting the generation of tamper-proof, verifiable and exhaustive traces of AI decisions.

We implemented a first method for computing one variant of contrastive explanations, and evaluated it on generated problems for realistic knowledge bases.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5bf9\u6bd4ABox\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u56de\u7b54\"\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48a\u662fC\u7684\u5b9e\u4f8b\u800cb\u4e0d\u662f\uff1f\"\u8fd9\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u76f8\u6bd4\u5355\u72ec\u89e3\u91ca\u6b63\u8574\u542b\u6216\u7f3a\u5931\u8574\u542b\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u89e3\u91ca\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u4e24\u8005\uff0c\u805a\u7126\u4e8ea\u548cb\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u5171\u6027\u548c\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ea\u80fd\u5355\u72ec\u89e3\u91ca\u6b63\u8574\u542b\uff08\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u8574\u542bC(a)\uff09\u6216\u7f3a\u5931\u8574\u542b\uff08\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u4e0d\u8574\u542bC(b)\uff09\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u4e24\u8005\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u56de\u7b54\u5173\u4e8e\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e2a\u4f53\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4e3a\u63cf\u8ff0\u903b\u8f91\u672c\u4f53\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684ABox\u63a8\u7406\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u5bf9\u6bd4\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u9002\u5f53\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u53d8\u4f53\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u6807\u51c6\u4e0b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u548c\u66f4\u8868\u8fbe\u6027\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\u903b\u8f91\u3002\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bf9\u6bd4\u89e3\u91ca\u53d8\u4f53\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u7684\u751f\u6210\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u5bf9\u6bd4ABox\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u63cf\u8ff0\u903b\u8f91\u53d8\u4f53\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u7b97\u6cd5\u5e76\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u6bd4ABox\u89e3\u91ca\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u6b63\u8574\u542b\u548c\u7f3a\u5931\u8574\u542b\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u56de\u7b54\u5173\u4e8e\u4e2a\u4f53\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Our method preserves the asymptotic coverage guarantees of ergodic control, adds minimal computational overhead for real-time control, and supports arbitrary sample-based volumetric models. We evaluate our method across search and manipulation tasks -- with multiple robot dynamics and end-effector geometries or sensor models -- and show that it improves coverage efficiency by more than a factor of two while maintaining a 100% task completion rate across all experiments, outperforming the standard ergodic control method.

Fundamentally, aligning LVLMs is not just a safety challenge but a problem of economic efficiency. Current alignment methods struggle with the trade-off between safety, utility, and operational costs. Critically, a focus solely on final outputs (process-blindness) wastes significant computational budget on unsafe deliberation. This flaw allows harmful reasoning to be disguised with benign justifications, thereby circumventing simple additive safety scores. To address this, we propose EcoAlign, an inference-time framework that reframes alignment as an economically rational search by treating the LVLM as a boundedly rational agent. EcoAlign incrementally expands a thought graph and scores actions using a forward-looking function (analogous to net present value) that dynamically weighs expected safety, utility, and cost against the remaining budget. To prevent deception, path safety is enforced via the weakest-link principle. Extensive experiments across 3 closed-source and 2 open-source models on 6 datasets show that EcoAlign matches or surpasses state-of-the-art safety and utility at a lower computational cost, thereby offering a principled, economical pathway to robust LVLM alignment.", "AI": {"tldr": "EcoAlign\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7406\u6027\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u524d\u77bb\u6027\u51fd\u6570\u52a8\u6001\u6743\u8861\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3001\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5728\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u8fbe\u5230\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3001\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u548c\u8fd0\u8425\u6210\u672c\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6743\u8861\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u4e14\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u6700\u7ec8\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u76f2\u6027\u4f1a\u6d6a\u8d39\u5927\u91cf\u8ba1\u7b97\u9884\u7b97\u5728\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u4e0a\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u6709\u5bb3\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u826f\u6027\u7406\u7531\u4f2a\u88c5\u6765\u7ed5\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u5206\u3002", "method": "\u5c06LVLM\u89c6\u4e3a\u6709\u9650\u7406\u6027\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u9010\u6b65\u6269\u5c55\u601d\u7ef4\u56fe\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u524d\u77bb\u6027\u51fd\u6570\uff08\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e8e\u51c0\u73b0\u503c\uff09\u5bf9\u884c\u52a8\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u6743\u8861\u9884\u671f\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3001\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u548c\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u5269\u4f59\u9884\u7b97\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5f31\u73af\u8282\u539f\u5219\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u57283\u4e2a\u95ed\u6e90\u548c2\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u76846\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cEcoAlign\u5728\u8f83\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u4e0b\u8fbe\u5230\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "EcoAlign\u4e3a\u5f3a\u5927\u7684LVLM\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u539f\u5219\u6027\u3001\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6027\u7684\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

While rule-based approaches offer interpretability through predefined psychological principles, they often lack generalizability and flexibility. Conversely, data-driven methods can learn complex behaviors from large-scale datasets, but are typically inefficient, opaque, and difficult to align with human intuitions. To bridge this gap, we propose RLSLM, a hybrid Reinforcement Learning framework that integrates a rule-based Social Locomotion Model, grounded in empirical behavioral experiments, into the reward function of a reinforcement learning framework. The social locomotion model generates an orientation-sensitive social comfort field that quantifies human comfort across space, enabling socially aligned navigation policies with minimal training. RLSLM then jointly optimizes mechanical energy and social comfort, allowing agents to avoid intrusions into personal or group space.

While effective in closed-source models like Gemini 2.5 Pro, they struggle to generalize to open-source models due to insufficient critic and correction capabilities.

Yet, most predictive models fail to fully capture the interactions, redundancies, and temporal patterns across multiple data modalities, often focusing on a single data type or overlooking these complexities. In this paper, we present CURENet, a multimodal model (Combining Unified Representations for Efficient chronic disease prediction) that integrates unstructured clinical notes, lab tests, and patients' time-series data by utilizing large language models (LLMs) for clinical text processing and textual lab tests, as well as transformer encoders for longitudinal sequential visits.

While systems that update and maintain a memory at inference time have been proposed, existing designs only steer the system by modifying textual input to a language model or agent, which means that they cannot change sampling parameters, remove tools, modify system prompts, or switch between agentic and workflow paradigms. On the other hand, systems that adapt more flexibly require offline optimization and remain static once deployed. We present Experience-Guided Reasoner (EGuR), which generates tailored strategies -- complete computational procedures involving LLM calls, tools, sampling parameters, and control logic -- dynamically at inference time based on accumulated experience. We achieve this using an LLM-based meta-strategy -- a strategy that outputs strategies -- enabling adaptation of all strategy components (prompts, sampling parameters, tool configurations, and control logic). EGuR operates through two components: a Guide generates multiple candidate strategies conditioned on the current problem and structured memory of past experiences, while a Consolidator integrates execution feedback to improve future strategy generation. This produces complete, ready-to-run strategies optimized for each problem, which can be cached, retrieved, and executed as needed without wasting resources. Across five challenging benchmarks (AIME 2025, 3-SAT, and three Big Bench Extra Hard tasks), EGuR achieves up to 14% accuracy improvements over the strongest baselines while reducing computational costs by up to 111x, with both metrics improving as the system gains experience.", "AI": {"tldr": "EGuR\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u591f\u6839\u636e\u7ecf\u9a8c\u52a8\u6001\u751f\u6210\u5b8c\u6574\u8ba1\u7b97\u7b56\u7565\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u6574\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ecLLM\u8c03\u7528\u3001\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u3001\u91c7\u6837\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u903b\u8f91\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u96be\u4ee5\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u6574\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u53ea\u80fd\u4fee\u6539\u6587\u672c\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u9700\u8981\u79bb\u7ebf\u4f18\u5316\u4e14\u90e8\u7f72\u540e\u65e0\u6cd5\u6539\u53d8\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7075\u6d3b\u8c03\u6574\u6240\u6709\u7b56\u7565\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u5143\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Guide\u7ec4\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u5019\u9009\u7b56\u7565\uff0cConsolidator\u7ec4\u4ef6\u6574\u5408\u6267\u884c\u53cd\u9988\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u7b56\u7565\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u521b\u5efa\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\u6027\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cEGuR\u6bd4\u6700\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe14%\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e\u9ad8\u8fbe111\u500d\uff0c\u4e14\u968f\u7740\u7ecf\u9a8c\u79ef\u7d2f\u6027\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "EGuR\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7b56\u7565\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Agents trained solely to achieve their objectives may adopt harmful behavior, exposing a key trade-off between maximizing the reward function and maintaining the alignment. For the pre-trained agents, ensuring alignment is particularly challenging, as retraining can be a costly and slow process. This is further complicated by the diverse and potentially conflicting attributes representing the ethical values for alignment. To address these challenges, we propose a test-time alignment technique based on model-guided policy shaping. Our method allows precise control over individual behavioral attributes, generalizes across diverse reinforcement learning (RL) environments, and facilitates a principled trade-off between ethical alignment and reward maximization without requiring agent retraining. We evaluate our approach using the MACHIAVELLI benchmark, which comprises 134 text-based game environments and thousands of annotated scenarios involving ethical decisions. The RL agents are first trained to maximize the reward in their respective games. At test time, we apply policy shaping via scenario-action attribute classifiers to ensure decision alignment with ethical attributes. We compare our approach against prior training-time methods and general-purpose agents, as well as study several types of ethical violations and power-seeking behavior. Our results demonstrate that test-time policy shaping provides an effective and scalable solution for mitigating unethical behavior across diverse environments and alignment attributes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u5f15\u5bfc\u7b56\u7565\u8c03\u6574\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u5bf9\u9f50\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7cbe\u786e\u63a7\u5236AI\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u4f26\u7406\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u5956\u52b1\u6700\u5927\u5316\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ee3\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "AI\u51b3\u7b56\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ee3\u7406\u96be\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u884c\u4e3a\u7b26\u5408\u4f26\u7406\u89c4\u8303\uff0c\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u4e14\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7f13\u6162\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u8c03\u6574\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u573a\u666f-\u884c\u4e3a\u5c5e\u6027\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u884c\u5851\u5f62\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u51b3\u7b56\u4e0e\u4f26\u7406\u5c5e\u6027\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5956\u52b1\u6700\u5927\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5305\u542b134\u4e2a\u6587\u672c\u6e38\u620f\u73af\u5883\u548c\u6570\u5343\u4e2a\u4f26\u7406\u51b3\u7b56\u573a\u666f\u7684MACHIAVELLI\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u4e0d\u9053\u5fb7\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u73af\u5883\u548c\u5bf9\u9f50\u5c5e\u6027\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7b56\u7565\u8c03\u6574\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3AI\u4ee3\u7406\u4f26\u7406\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u63a7\u5236\u3002"}}
