A generalized gamma scale mixture draws the variances from a generalized gamma distribution. Generalized gamma scale mixtures of normals have been proposed as an attractive class of parametric priors for Bayesian inference in inverse imaging problems. Generalized gamma scale mixtures have two shape parameters, one that controls the behavior of the distribution about its mode, and the other that controls its tail decay. In this paper, we provide the first demonstration that the prior model is realistic for multiple large imaging data sets. We draw data from remote sensing, medical imaging, and image classification applications. We study the realism of the prior when applied to Fourier and wavelet (Haar and Gabor) transformations of the images, as well as to the coefficients produced by convolving the images against the filters used in the first layer of AlexNet, a popular convolutional neural network trained for image classification. We discuss data augmentation procedures that improve the fit of the model, procedures for identifying approximately exchangeable coefficients, and characterize the parameter regions that best describe the observed data sets. These regions are significantly broader than the region of primary focus in computational work. We show that this prior family provides a substantially better fit to each data set than any of the standard priors it contains. These include Gaussian, Laplace, $\\ell_p$, and Student's $t$ priors. Finally, we identify cases where the prior is unrealistic and highlight characteristic features of images that suggest the model will fit poorly."}

Our approach combines multilevel regression with municipal and departmental spatial random effects, and it incorporates Ridge and Lasso regularization priors to compare the contribution of sociodemographic covariates. Inference is implemented in a fully open source workflow using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, and model behavior is assessed through synthetic data that mirror key features of the observed data. Simulation results indicate that Ridge provides the most balanced performance in parameter recovery, predictive accuracy, and sampling efficiency, while Lasso shows weaker fit and posterior stability, with gains in predictive accuracy under stronger multicollinearity. In the application, posterior rankings show a strong centralization of performance, with higher scores in central departments and lower scores in peripheral territories, and the strongest correlates of scores are student level living conditions, maternal education, access to educational resources, gender, and ethnic background, while spatial random effects capture residual regional disparities. A hybrid Bayesian segmentation based on K means propagates posterior uncertainty into clustering at departmental, municipal, and spatial scales, revealing multiscale territorial patterns consistent with structural inequalities and informing territorial targeting in education policy."}

We conduct a rigorous empirical comparison of price forecasting performance between the proposed curve-based model, i.e., derived from predicted merit-order curves, and state-of-the-art price-based models that directly forecast the clearing price, using data from the Italian day-ahead market over the 2023-2024 period. Our results show that the proposed curve-based approach significantly improves both point and probabilistic price forecasting accuracy relative to price-based approaches, with average gains of approximately 5%, and improvements of up to 10% during mid-day hours, when prices occasionally drop due to high renewable generation and low demand."}

It promised new ways to interact with people in three-dimensional digital spaces. This cross-sectional study investigates the attitudes, perceptions, and predictors of the willingness to engage with the Metaverse among 381 Turkish university students surveyed in December 2021. The study employs Fisher's Exact Tests and binary logistic regression to assess the influence of demographic characteristics, prior digital experience, and perception-based factors. The results demonstrate that demographic factors, such as gender, educational attainment, faculty association, social media engagement, and previous virtual reality exposure, do not significantly forecast the propensity to participate in the Metaverse. Instead, the main things that affect people's intentions to adopt are how they see things. Belief in the Metaverse's capacity to revolutionize societal frameworks, especially human rights, surfaced as the most significant positive predictor of willingness. Conversely, apprehensions regarding psychological harm, framed as a possible 'cyber syndrome' represented a significant obstacle to participation. Perceptions of technical compatibility and ethical considerations showed complex effects, showing that optimism, uncertainty, and indifference affect willingness in different ways. In general, the results show that early adoption of the Metaverse is based on how people see it, not on their demographics. The research establishes a historically informed benchmark of user skepticism and prudent assessment during the advent of Web 3.0, underscoring the necessity of addressing collective psychological, ethical, and normative issues to promote future engagement."}

Ising machines implemented using dynamical, digital and compute-in-memory (CiM) approaches offer a promising alternative, but often suffer from poor initialization and a fundamental trade-off between algorithmic performance and hardware efficiency. Hardware-friendly schemes such as simulated annealing converge slowly, whereas faster algorithms, including simulated bifurcation, are difficult to implement efficiently in CiM hardware, limiting both convergence speed and solution quality. To address these limitations, here we present a ferroelectric field-effect transistor (FeFET)-based CiM Ising framework that tightly co-designs algorithms and hardware to efficiently solve large-scale combinatorial optimization problems. The proposed approach employs a two-step algorithmic flow: an attention-inspired initialization that exploits global spin topology and reduces the required iterations by up to 80%, followed by a lightweight simulated bifurcation algorithm specifically tailored for CiM implementation. To natively accelerate the core vector-matrix and vector-matrix-vector operations in both steps, we fabricate a 32x256 FeFET CiM chip using ferroelectric capacitors integrated at the back end of line of a 180-nm CMOS platform. Across Max-Cut instances with up to 100,000 nodes, the proposed hardware-software co-designed solver achieves up to a 175.9x speedup over a GPU-based simulated bifurcation implementation while consistently delivering superior solution quality."}

This study addresses the challenge of distinguishing stable influencers from transient ones among users who are influential at a given point in time. We particularly focus on two distinct types of influencers: source spreaders, who widely disseminate their own content, and brokers, who play a key role in propagating information originating from others. Using six months of retweet data from approximately 19,000 Twitter users, we analyze the characteristics of stable influencers. Our findings reveal that users who have maintained influence in the past are more likely to continue doing so in the future. Furthermore, we develop classification models to predict stable influencers among temporarily influential users, achieving an AUC of approximately 0.89 for source spreaders and 0.81 for brokers. Our experimental results highlight that current influence is a critical factor in classifying influencers, while past influence also significantly contributes, particularly for source spreaders."}

While DI has traditionally served as the foundation of fair lending law, recent regulatory efforts have invoked UDAP, a doctrine rooted in consumer protection, as an alternative means to address algorithmic discrimination harms. We formalize and operationalize both doctrines in a simulated lending setting to assess how they evaluate algorithmic disparities. While some regulatory interpretations treat UDAP as operating similarly to DI, we argue it is an independent and analytically distinct framework. In particular, UDAP's \"unfairness\" prong introduces elements such as avoidability of harm and proportionality balancing, while its \"deceptive\" and \"abusive\" standards may capture forms of algorithmic harm that elude DI analysis. At the same time, translating UDAP into algorithmic settings exposes unresolved ambiguities, underscoring the need for further regulatory guidance if it is to serve as a workable standard."}

The depth and context from traditionally qualitative methods such as participant observation, in-depth interviews, and historical documents are increasingly employed alongside scalable data management, computational text analysis, and open-science practices. Machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP), provide resources to aggregate and systematically index large volumes of qualitative data, identify patterns, and maintain clear links to in-depth accounts. Drawing on case studies of projects that examine later life--including examples with original data from the DISCERN study (a team-based ethnography of life with dementia) and secondary analyses of the American Voices Project (nationally representative interview)--the chapter highlights both uses and challenges of bringing CSS tools into more meaningful dialogue with qualitative aging research. The chapter argues such work has potential for (1) streamlining and augmenting existing workflows, (2) scaling up samples and projects, and (3) generating multi-method approaches to address important questions in new ways, before turning to practices useful for individuals and teams seeking to understand current possibilities or refine their workflow processes. The chapter concludes that current developments are not without peril, but offer potential for new insights into aging and the life course by broadening--rather than replacing--the methodological foundations of qualitative research."}

I review some of the classic work on linear models with constant coefficients, and then describe some approaches that allow for coefficient heterogeneity in models with feedback.

Aggregated records, such as origin-destination (OD) matrices, offer partial insights but fail to capture the key behavioral properties of daily human movement, limiting realistic city-scale analyses.\n  This study presents a privacy-preserving synthetic mobility dataset that reconstructs daily trajectories from aggregated inputs. The proposed method integrates OD flows with two complementary behavioral constraints: (1) dwell-travel time quantiles that are available only as coarse summary statistics and (2) the universal law for the daily distribution of the number of visited locations. Embedding these elements in a multi-objective optimization framework enables the reproduction of realistic distributions of human mobility while ensuring that no personal identifiers are required.\n  The proposed framework is validated in two contrasting regions of Japan: (1) the 23 special wards of Tokyo, representing a dense metropolitan environment; and (2) Fukuoka Prefecture, where urban and suburban mobility patterns coexist. The resulting synthetic mobility data reproduce dwell-travel time and visit frequency distributions with high fidelity, while deviations in OD consistency remain within the natural range of daily fluctuations.\n  The results of this study establish a practical synthesis pathway under real-world constraints, providing governments, urban planners, and industries with scalable access to high-resolution mobility data for reliable analytics without the need for sensitive personal records, and supporting practical deployments in policy and commercial domains."}

These incidents not only raise technical issues but also carry complex moral implications, rendering conventional, technologically driven, and reactive management methods inadequate to address the underlying causes of the problem, including intent, morality, and potential intangible social impacts. Based on these issues, this study aims to formulate a comprehensive Islamic ethical framework that can serve as a more comprehensive preventative tool to mitigate the risks of misuse of deepfakes. The study employed a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) guided by PRISMA, selecting ten primary sources published between 2018 and 2025 to identify ethical deficiencies, regulatory needs, and appropriate normative solutions. The analysis shows that the integration of the principles of (Maqasid al-Shariah) particularly (hifz al-ird) protecting honor and (hifz al-nafs) protecting the self, provides a strong normative basis for regulating the responsible use of technology. This study yields three strategic recommendations: regulatory changes that recognize the intangible and psychological harm caused by reputational damage; improved technology management through moral scrutiny that upholds the values of justice (adl), trust, and openness; and increased public digital literacy based on the principle of (tabayyun) examination and caution. Overall, this study concludes that the application of Islamic ethics offers a shift in thinking from punitive mechanisms to preventative approaches that focus on protecting human dignity, preventing harm, and strengthening the common good in the digital age."}

The analysis is conducted based on four main aspects: media characteristics, da'wah communication strategies, audience engagement effectiveness, and user behavioral responses. The research employs a descriptive quantitative approach through observations of the popular da'wah account @hananattakistory during the period of October to November 2025. The findings indicate that TikTok excels in the effectiveness of disseminating da'wah messages through high interaction rates, achieving an engagement rate of 1.42%. In contrast, Instagram records a higher total interaction with an engagement rate of 5.47%, reflecting deeper and more reflective audience involvement. Qualitative analysis shows that TikTok is more effective in the initial stage of capturing audience attention (awareness), while Instagram is stronger in building loyalty and fostering a digital da'wah community. Thus, combining the use of both platforms can serve as a complementary digital da'wah strategy, expanding reach while deepening the understanding of Islamic values in the era of social media. The main contribution of this study lies in its comparative, empirically grounded approach that integrates both qualitative and quantitative analyses to map the effectiveness of da'wah across platforms, providing a strategic foundation for developing adaptive and contextual digital da'wah for young Muslim audiences."}

Based on real-world evidence from democratic innovations in participatory budgeting, in Switzerland and beyond, I highlight a trilogy of key research results: Fair voting methods achieve to be (i) legitimacy incubator, (ii) novel impact accelerator and (iii) safeguard for risks of artificial intelligence (AI). Compared to majoritarian voting methods, combining expressive ballot formats (e.g. cumulative voting) with ballot aggregation methods that promote proportional representation (e.g. equal shares) results in more winners and higher (geographical) representation of citizens. Such fair voting methods are preferred and found fairer even by voters who do not win, while promoting stronger democratic values for citizens such as altruism and compromise. They also result in new resourceful ideas to put for voting, which are cost-effective and win, especially in areas of welfare, education and culture. Strikingly, fair voting methods are also more resilient to biases and inconsistencies of generative AI in emerging scenarios of AI voting assistance or AI representation of voters who would be likely to abstain. I also review the relevance of such upgrades for democracies in crisis, such as the one of Greece featured in the recent study of `Unmute Democracy'. Greek democracy can build stronger resilience via higher representation of citizens in democratic processes as well as democratic innovations in participation. Fair voting methods can be a catalyst for both endeavors."}

The range of concerns is wide, spanning current day risks to future existential risks, and a range of loss of control pathways from rapid AI self-exfiltration scenarios to more gradual disempowerment scenarios. In this work we set out to firstly, provide a more structured framework for discussing and characterizing loss of control and secondly, to use this framework to assist those responsible for the safe operation of AI-containing socio-technical systems to identify causal factors leading to loss of control. We explore how these two needs can be better met by making use of a methodology developed within the safety-critical systems community known as STAMP and its associated hazard analysis technique of STPA. We select the STAMP methodology primarily because it is based around a world-view that socio-technical systems can be functionally modeled as control structures, and that safety issues arise when there is a loss of control in these structures."}

While DI has traditionally served as the foundation of fair lending law, recent regulatory efforts have invoked UDAP, a doctrine rooted in consumer protection, as an alternative means to address algorithmic discrimination harms. We formalize and operationalize both doctrines in a simulated lending setting to assess how they evaluate algorithmic disparities. While some regulatory interpretations treat UDAP as operating similarly to DI, we argue it is an independent and analytically distinct framework. In particular, UDAP's \"unfairness\" prong introduces elements such as avoidability of harm and proportionality balancing, while its \"deceptive\" and \"abusive\" standards may capture forms of algorithmic harm that elude DI analysis. At the same time, translating UDAP into algorithmic settings exposes unresolved ambiguities, underscoring the need for further regulatory guidance if it is to serve as a workable standard."}

Our analysis reveals a significant transformation in the city's sonic environment during the festive period: overall sound pressure levels increase significantly, soundscape patterns change, and the acoustic landscape becomes dominated by sounds associated with human activity. These findings highlight the potential of distributed smart acoustic monitoring systems to characterize the temporal dynamics of urban soundscapes and underscore how the large-scale event of San Fermin drastically reshapes the overall acoustic dynamics of the city of Pamplona.

It promised new ways to interact with people in three-dimensional digital spaces. This cross-sectional study investigates the attitudes, perceptions, and predictors of the willingness to engage with the Metaverse among 381 Turkish university students surveyed in December 2021. The study employs Fisher's Exact Tests and binary logistic regression to assess the influence of demographic characteristics, prior digital experience, and perception-based factors. The results demonstrate that demographic factors, such as gender, educational attainment, faculty association, social media engagement, and previous virtual reality exposure, do not significantly forecast the propensity to participate in the Metaverse. Instead, the main things that affect people's intentions to adopt are how they see things. Belief in the Metaverse's capacity to revolutionize societal frameworks, especially human rights, surfaced as the most significant positive predictor of willingness. Conversely, apprehensions regarding psychological harm, framed as a possible 'cyber syndrome' represented a significant obstacle to participation. Perceptions of technical compatibility and ethical considerations showed complex effects, showing that optimism, uncertainty, and indifference affect willingness in different ways. In general, the results show that early adoption of the Metaverse is based on how people see it, not on their demographics. The research establishes a historically informed benchmark of user skepticism and prudent assessment during the advent of Web 3.0, underscoring the necessity of addressing collective psychological, ethical, and normative issues to promote future engagement."}

In the context of the 2024 European Parliament and French legislative elections, this study investigates how political actors and news media used YouTube to shape public discourse. We analyze over 100,000 video transcripts and metadata from 74 French YouTube channels operated by national news outlets, local media, and political figures. To identify the key themes emphasized during the campaign period, we applied a semi-automated method that combined large language models with clustering and manual review. The results reveal distinct thematic patterns across the political spectrum and media types, with right-leaning news outlets focusing on topics like immigration, while left-leaning emphasized protest and media freedom. Themes generating the most audience engagement, measured by comment-to-view ratios, were most often the most polarizing ones. In contrast, less polarizing themes such as video games and nature showed higher approval, reflected in like-to-view ratios. We also observed a general tendency across all media types to portray political figures in neutral or critical terms rather than favorable ones."}

The depth and context from traditionally qualitative methods such as participant observation, in-depth interviews, and historical documents are increasingly employed alongside scalable data management, computational text analysis, and open-science practices. Machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP), provide resources to aggregate and systematically index large volumes of qualitative data, identify patterns, and maintain clear links to in-depth accounts. Drawing on case studies of projects that examine later life--including examples with original data from the DISCERN study (a team-based ethnography of life with dementia) and secondary analyses of the American Voices Project (nationally representative interview)--the chapter highlights both uses and challenges of bringing CSS tools into more meaningful dialogue with qualitative aging research. The chapter argues such work has potential for (1) streamlining and augmenting existing workflows, (2) scaling up samples and projects, and (3) generating multi-method approaches to address important questions in new ways, before turning to practices useful for individuals and teams seeking to understand current possibilities or refine their workflow processes. The chapter concludes that current developments are not without peril, but offer potential for new insights into aging and the life course by broadening--rather than replacing--the methodological foundations of qualitative research."}

One promising approach is implementing skill libraries that allow agents to learn, validate, and apply new skills. However, current skill library approaches rely primarily on LLM prompting, making consistent skill library implementation challenging. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based approach to enhance agents' self-improvement capabilities with a skill library. Specifically, we introduce Skill Augmented GRPO for self-Evolution (SAGE), a novel RL framework that systematically incorporates skills into learning. The framework's key component, Sequential Rollout, iteratively deploys agents across a chain of similar tasks for each rollout. As agents navigate through the task chain, skills generated from previous tasks accumulate in the library and become available for subsequent tasks. Additionally, the framework enhances skill generation and utilization through a Skill-integrated Reward that complements the original outcome-based rewards. Experimental results on AppWorld demonstrate that SAGE, when applied to supervised-finetuned model with expert experience, achieves 8.9% higher Scenario Goal Completion while requiring 26% fewer interaction steps and generating 59% fewer tokens, substantially outperforming existing approaches in both accuracy and efficiency."}

Aggregated records, such as origin-destination (OD) matrices, offer partial insights but fail to capture the key behavioral properties of daily human movement, limiting realistic city-scale analyses.\n  This study presents a privacy-preserving synthetic mobility dataset that reconstructs daily trajectories from aggregated inputs. The proposed method integrates OD flows with two complementary behavioral constraints: (1) dwell-travel time quantiles that are available only as coarse summary statistics and (2) the universal law for the daily distribution of the number of visited locations. Embedding these elements in a multi-objective optimization framework enables the reproduction of realistic distributions of human mobility while ensuring that no personal identifiers are required.\n  The proposed framework is validated in two contrasting regions of Japan: (1) the 23 special wards of Tokyo, representing a dense metropolitan environment; and (2) Fukuoka Prefecture, where urban and suburban mobility patterns coexist. The resulting synthetic mobility data reproduce dwell-travel time and visit frequency distributions with high fidelity, while deviations in OD consistency remain within the natural range of daily fluctuations.\n  The results of this study establish a practical synthesis pathway under real-world constraints, providing governments, urban planners, and industries with scalable access to high-resolution mobility data for reliable analytics without the need for sensitive personal records, and supporting practical deployments in policy and commercial domains."}

One promising approach is implementing skill libraries that allow agents to learn, validate, and apply new skills. However, current skill library approaches rely primarily on LLM prompting, making consistent skill library implementation challenging. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based approach to enhance agents' self-improvement capabilities with a skill library. Specifically, we introduce Skill Augmented GRPO for self-Evolution (SAGE), a novel RL framework that systematically incorporates skills into learning. The framework's key component, Sequential Rollout, iteratively deploys agents across a chain of similar tasks for each rollout. As agents navigate through the task chain, skills generated from previous tasks accumulate in the library and become available for subsequent tasks. Additionally, the framework enhances skill generation and utilization through a Skill-integrated Reward that complements the original outcome-based rewards. Experimental results on AppWorld demonstrate that SAGE, when applied to supervised-finetuned model with expert experience, achieves 8.9% higher Scenario Goal Completion while requiring 26% fewer interaction steps and generating 59% fewer tokens, substantially outperforming existing approaches in both accuracy and efficiency."}

Ising machines implemented using dynamical, digital and compute-in-memory (CiM) approaches offer a promising alternative, but often suffer from poor initialization and a fundamental trade-off between algorithmic performance and hardware efficiency. Hardware-friendly schemes such as simulated annealing converge slowly, whereas faster algorithms, including simulated bifurcation, are difficult to implement efficiently in CiM hardware, limiting both convergence speed and solution quality. To address these limitations, here we present a ferroelectric field-effect transistor (FeFET)-based CiM Ising framework that tightly co-designs algorithms and hardware to efficiently solve large-scale combinatorial optimization problems. The proposed approach employs a two-step algorithmic flow: an attention-inspired initialization that exploits global spin topology and reduces the required iterations by up to 80%, followed by a lightweight simulated bifurcation algorithm specifically tailored for CiM implementation. To natively accelerate the core vector-matrix and vector-matrix-vector operations in both steps, we fabricate a 32x256 FeFET CiM chip using ferroelectric capacitors integrated at the back end of line of a 180-nm CMOS platform.

At each step, a pretrained world model and latent-space MPC planner generate a short-horizon action queue together with predicted latent rollouts, allowing the agent to execute multiple planned actions without immediate replanning.

This study addresses the challenge of distinguishing stable influencers from transient ones among users who are influential at a given point in time. We particularly focus on two distinct types of influencers: source spreaders, who widely disseminate their own content, and brokers, who play a key role in propagating information originating from others. Using six months of retweet data from approximately 19,000 Twitter users, we analyze the characteristics of stable influencers. Our findings reveal that users who have maintained influence in the past are more likely to continue doing so in the future. Furthermore, we develop classification models to predict stable influencers among temporarily influential users, achieving an AUC of approximately 0.89 for source spreaders and 0.81 for brokers.

Evaluated on five seasons of Premier League event data, EventGPT outperforms existing sequence-based baselines in next-event prediction accuracy and spatial precision.

Pokémon battles demand reasoning about type matchups, statistical trade-offs, and risk assessment, skills that mirror human strategic thinking. This work examines whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can serve as competent battle agents, capable of both making tactically sound decisions and generating novel, balanced game content. We developed a turn-based Pokémon battle system where LLMs select moves based on battle state rather than pre-programmed logic. The framework captures essential Pokémon mechanics: type effectiveness multipliers, stat-based damage calculations, and multi-Pokémon team management. Through systematic evaluation across multiple model architectures we measured win rates, decision latency, type-alignment accuracy, and token efficiency. These results suggest LLMs can function as dynamic game opponents without domain-specific training, offering a practical alternative to reinforcement learning for turn-based strategic games. The dual capability of tactical reasoning and content creation, positions LLMs as both players and designers, with implications for procedural generation and adaptive difficulty systems in interactive entertainment."}

One challenge is that human concepts themselves are fluid: conceptual boundaries can shift, split, and merge as inquiry progresses (e.g., Pluto is no longer considered a planet). To make progress, we need a definition of \"concept\" that is not merely a dictionary label, but a structure that can be revised, compared, and aligned across agents. We propose an algorithmic-information viewpoint that treats a concept as an information object defined only through its structural relation to an agent's total experience. The core constraint is determination: a set of parts forms a reversible consistency relation if any missing part is recoverable from the others (up to the standard logarithmic slack in Kolmogorov-style identities). This reversibility prevents \"concepts\" from floating free of experience and turns concept existence into a checkable structural claim. To judge whether a decomposition is natural, we define excess information, measuring the redundancy overhead introduced by splitting experience into multiple separately described parts. On top of these definitions, we formulate dialectics as an optimization dynamics: as new patches of information appear (or become contested), competing concepts bid to explain them via shorter conditional descriptions, driving systematic expansion, contraction, splitting, and merging. Finally, we formalize low-cost concept transmission and multi-agent alignment using small grounds/seeds that allow another agent to reconstruct the same concept under a shared protocol, making communication a concrete compute-bits trade-off."}

Based on these issues, this study aims to formulate a comprehensive Islamic ethical framework that can serve as a more comprehensive preventative tool to mitigate the risks of misuse of deepfakes. The study employed a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) guided by PRISMA, selecting ten primary sources published between 2018 and 2025 to identify ethical deficiencies, regulatory needs, and appropriate normative solutions. The analysis shows that the integration of the principles of (Maqasid al-Shariah) particularly (hifz al-ird) protecting honor and (hifz al-nafs) protecting the self, provides a strong normative basis for regulating the responsible use of technology. This study yields three strategic recommendations: regulatory changes that recognize the intangible and psychological harm caused by reputational damage; improved technology management through moral scrutiny that upholds the values of justice (adl), trust, and openness; and increased public digital literacy based on the principle of (tabayyun) examination and caution.

This effect has been studied extensively in classification tasks, but not in sequential decision-making, where an agent learns a policy to achieve an objective by taking actions in an environment. In this paper, we translate the Rashomon effect to sequential decision-making. We define it as multiple policies that exhibit identical behavior, visiting the same states and selecting the same actions, while differing in their internal structure, such as feature attributions. Verifying identical behavior in sequential decision-making differs from classification. In classification, predictions can be directly compared to ground-truth labels. In sequential decision-making with stochastic transitions, the same policy may succeed or fail on any single trajectory due to randomness. We address this using formal verification methods that construct and compare the complete probabilistic behavior of each policy in the environment. Our experiments demonstrate that the Rashomon effect exists in sequential decision-making. We further show that ensembles constructed from the Rashomon set exhibit greater robustness to distribution shifts than individual policies. Additionally, permissive policies derived from the Rashomon set reduce computational requirements for verification while maintaining optimal performance."}

In this paper, we propose timed reward machines (TRMs), which are an extension of reward machines that incorporate timing constraints into the reward structure. TRMs enable more expressive specifications with tunable reward logic, for example, imposing costs for delays and granting rewards for timely actions. We study model-free RL frameworks (i.e., tabular Q-learning) for learning optimal policies with TRMs under digital and real-time semantics. Our algorithms integrate the TRM into learning via abstractions of timed automata, and employ counterfactual-imagining heuristics that exploit the structure of the TRM to improve the search.

To address this gap, we introduce EventGPT, a player-conditioned, value-aware next-event prediction model built on a GPT-style autoregressive transformer. Our model treats match play as a sequence of discrete tokens, jointly learning to predict the next on-ball action's type, location, timing, and its estimated residual On-Ball Value (rOBV) based on the preceding context and player identity. A key contribution of this framework is the ability to perform counterfactual simulations. By substituting learned player embeddings into new event sequences, we can simulate how a player's behavioral distribution and value profile would change when placed in a different team or tactical structure. Evaluated on five seasons of Premier League event data, EventGPT outperforms existing sequence-based baselines in next-event prediction accuracy and spatial precision. Furthermore, we demonstrate the model's practical utility for transfer analysis through case studies-such as comparing striker performance across different systems and identifying stylistic replacements for specific roles-showing that our approach provides a principled method for evaluating transfer fit."}

This shift has triggered urgent debate regarding Anthropomorphism, the attribution of human characteristics to synthetic agents, and its potential to induce misplaced trust or emotional dependency. However, the causal link between more humanlike AI design and subsequent effects on engagement and trust has not been tested in realistic human-AI interactions with a global user pool. Prevailing safety frameworks continue to rely on theoretical assumptions derived from Western populations, overlooking the global diversity of AI users. Here, we address these gaps through two large-scale cross-national experiments (N=3,500) across 10 diverse nations, involving real-time and open-ended interactions with an AI system. We find that when evaluating an AI's human-likeness, users focus less on the kind of theoretical aspects often cited in policy (e.g., sentience or consciousness), but rather applied, interactional cues like conversation flow or understanding the user's perspective. We also experimentally demonstrate that humanlike design levers can causally increase anthropomorphism among users; however, we do not find that humanlike design universally increases behavioral measures for user engagement and trust, as previous theoretical work suggests. Instead, part of the connection between human-likeness and behavioral outcomes is fractured by culture: specific design choices that foster self-reported trust in AI-systems in some populations (e.g., Brazil) may trigger the opposite result in others (e.g., Japan). Our findings challenge prevailing narratives of inherent risk in humanlike AI design. Instead, we identify a nuanced, culturally mediated landscape of human-AI interaction, which demands that we move beyond a one-size-fits-all approach in AI governance."}

Pokémon battles demand reasoning about type matchups, statistical trade-offs, and risk assessment, skills that mirror human strategic thinking. This work examines whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can serve as competent battle agents, capable of both making tactically sound decisions and generating novel, balanced game content. We developed a turn-based Pokémon battle system where LLMs select moves based on battle state rather than pre-programmed logic. The framework captures essential Pokémon mechanics: type effectiveness multipliers, stat-based damage calculations, and multi-Pokémon team management. Through systematic evaluation across multiple model architectures we measured win rates, decision latency, type-alignment accuracy, and token efficiency. These results suggest LLMs can function as dynamic game opponents without domain-specific training, offering a practical alternative to reinforcement learning for turn-based strategic games. The dual capability of tactical reasoning and content creation, positions LLMs as both players and designers, with implications for procedural generation and adaptive difficulty systems in interactive entertainment."}

To theoretically formalize the desired reasoning behaviors, this paper presents the Laws of Reasoning (LoRe), a unified framework that characterizes intrinsic reasoning patterns in LRMs. We first propose compute law with the hypothesis that the reasoning compute should scale linearly with question complexity. Beyond compute, we extend LoRe with a supplementary accuracy law. Since the question complexity is difficult to quantify in practice, we examine these hypotheses by two properties of the laws, monotonicity and compositionality. We therefore introduce LoRe-Bench, a benchmark that systematically measures these two tractable properties for large reasoning models. Evaluation shows that most reasoning models exhibit reasonable monotonicity but lack compositionality. In response, we develop an effective finetuning approach that enforces compute-law compositionality. Extensive empirical studies demonstrate that better compliance with compute laws yields consistently improved reasoning performance on multiple benchmarks, and uncovers synergistic effects across properties and laws.

One challenge is that human concepts themselves are fluid: conceptual boundaries can shift, split, and merge as inquiry progresses (e.g., Pluto is no longer considered a planet). To make progress, we need a definition of \"concept\" that is not merely a dictionary label, but a structure that can be revised, compared, and aligned across agents. We propose an algorithmic-information viewpoint that treats a concept as an information object defined only through its structural relation to an agent's total experience. The core constraint is determination: a set of parts forms a reversible consistency relation if any missing part is recoverable from the others (up to the standard logarithmic slack in Kolmogorov-style identities). This reversibility prevents \"concepts\" from floating free of experience and turns concept existence into a checkable structural claim. To judge whether a decomposition is natural, we define excess information, measuring the redundancy overhead introduced by splitting experience into multiple separately described parts. On top of these definitions, we formulate dialectics as an optimization dynamics: as new patches of information appear (or become contested), competing concepts bid to explain them via shorter conditional descriptions, driving systematic expansion, contraction, splitting, and merging. Finally, we formalize low-cost concept transmission and multi-agent alignment using small grounds/seeds that allow another agent to reconstruct the same concept under a shared protocol, making communication a concrete compute-bits trade-off."}

These incidents not only raise technical issues but also carry complex moral implications, rendering conventional, technologically driven, and reactive management methods inadequate to address the underlying causes of the problem, including intent, morality, and potential intangible social impacts. Based on these issues, this study aims to formulate a comprehensive Islamic ethical framework that can serve as a more comprehensive preventative tool to mitigate the risks of misuse of deepfakes. The study employed a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) guided by PRISMA, selecting ten primary sources published between 2018 and 2025 to identify ethical deficiencies, regulatory needs, and appropriate normative solutions. The analysis shows that the integration of the principles of (Maqasid al-Shariah) particularly (hifz al-ird) protecting honor and (hifz al-nafs) protecting the self, provides a strong normative basis for regulating the responsible use of technology. This study yields three strategic recommendations: regulatory changes that recognize the intangible and psychological harm caused by reputational damage; improved technology management through moral scrutiny that upholds the values of justice (adl), trust, and openness; and increased public digital literacy based on the principle of (tabayyun) examination and caution. Overall, this study concludes that the application of Islamic ethics offers a shift in thinking from punitive mechanisms to preventative approaches that focus on protecting human dignity, preventing harm, and strengthening the common good in the digital age."}

The proposed method integrates OD flows with two complementary behavioral constraints: (1) dwell-travel time quantiles that are available only as coarse summary statistics and (2) the universal law for the daily distribution of the number of visited locations. Embedding these elements in a multi-objective optimization framework enables the reproduction of realistic distributions of human mobility while ensuring that no personal identifiers are required.\n  The proposed framework is validated in two contrasting regions of Japan: (1) the 23 special wards of Tokyo, representing a dense metropolitan environment; and (2) Fukuoka Prefecture, where urban and suburban mobility patterns coexist. The resulting synthetic mobility data reproduce dwell-travel time and visit frequency distributions with high fidelity, while deviations in OD consistency remain within the natural range of daily fluctuations.\n  The results of this study establish a practical synthesis pathway under real-world constraints, providing governments, urban planners, and industries with scalable access to high-resolution mobility data for reliable analytics without the need for sensitive personal records, and supporting practical deployments in policy and commercial domains."}

This effect has been studied extensively in classification tasks, but not in sequential decision-making, where an agent learns a policy to achieve an objective by taking actions in an environment. In this paper, we translate the Rashomon effect to sequential decision-making. We define it as multiple policies that exhibit identical behavior, visiting the same states and selecting the same actions, while differing in their internal structure, such as feature attributions. Verifying identical behavior in sequential decision-making differs from classification. In classification, predictions can be directly compared to ground-truth labels. In sequential decision-making with stochastic transitions, the same policy may succeed or fail on any single trajectory due to randomness. We address this using formal verification methods that construct and compare the complete probabilistic behavior of each policy in the environment. Our experiments demonstrate that the Rashomon effect exists in sequential decision-making. We further show that ensembles constructed from the Rashomon set exhibit greater robustness to distribution shifts than individual policies. Additionally, permissive policies derived from the Rashomon set reduce computational requirements for verification while maintaining optimal performance."}

When tested against traditional machine learning models like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, and KNN, the LLM-based system delivered impressive results, achieving an accuracy of 90% and Top-3 accuracy of 100%.

In this work we set out to firstly, provide a more structured framework for discussing and characterizing loss of control and secondly, to use this framework to assist those responsible for the safe operation of AI-containing socio-technical systems to identify causal factors leading to loss of control. We explore how these two needs can be better met by making use of a methodology developed within the safety-critical systems community known as STAMP and its associated hazard analysis technique of STPA. We select the STAMP methodology primarily because it is based around a world-view that socio-technical systems can be functionally modeled as control structures, and that safety issues arise when there is a loss of control in these structures."}

To express non-Markovian rewards, formalisms such as reward machines have been introduced to capture dependencies on histories. However, traditional reward machines lack the ability to model precise timing constraints, limiting their use in time-sensitive applications. In this paper, we propose timed reward machines (TRMs), which are an extension of reward machines that incorporate timing constraints into the reward structure. TRMs enable more expressive specifications with tunable reward logic, for example, imposing costs for delays and granting rewards for timely actions. We study model-free RL frameworks (i.e., tabular Q-learning) for learning optimal policies with TRMs under digital and real-time semantics. Our algorithms integrate the TRM into learning via abstractions of timed automata, and employ counterfactual-imagining heuristics that exploit the structure of the TRM to improve the search. Experimentally, we demonstrate that our algorithm learns policies that achieve high rewards while satisfying the timing constraints specified by the TRM on popular RL benchmarks. Moreover, we conduct comparative studies of performance under different TRM semantics, along with ablations that highlight the benefits of counterfactual-imagining."}

The research employs a descriptive quantitative approach through observations of the popular da'wah account @hananattakistory during the period of October to November 2025. The findings indicate that TikTok excels in the effectiveness of disseminating da'wah messages through high interaction rates, achieving an engagement rate of 1.42%. In contrast, Instagram records a higher total interaction with an engagement rate of 5.47%, reflecting deeper and more reflective audience involvement. Qualitative analysis shows that TikTok is more effective in the initial stage of capturing audience attention (awareness), while Instagram is stronger in building loyalty and fostering a digital da'wah community. Thus, combining the use of both platforms can serve as a complementary digital da'wah strategy, expanding reach while deepening the understanding of Islamic values in the era of social media. The main contribution of this study lies in its comparative, empirically grounded approach that integrates both qualitative and quantitative analyses to map the effectiveness of da'wah across platforms, providing a strategic foundation for developing adaptive and contextual digital da'wah for young Muslim audiences."}

The study employs Fisher's Exact Tests and binary logistic regression to assess the influence of demographic characteristics, prior digital experience, and perception-based factors. The results demonstrate that demographic factors, such as gender, educational attainment, faculty association, social media engagement, and previous virtual reality exposure, do not significantly forecast the propensity to participate in the Metaverse. Instead, the main things that affect people's intentions to adopt are how they see things. Belief in the Metaverse's capacity to revolutionize societal frameworks, especially human rights, surfaced as the most significant positive predictor of willingness. Conversely, apprehensions regarding psychological harm, framed as a possible 'cyber syndrome' represented a significant obstacle to participation. Perceptions of technical compatibility and ethical considerations showed complex effects, showing that optimism, uncertainty, and indifference affect willingness in different ways. In general, the results show that early adoption of the Metaverse is based on how people see it, not on their demographics. The research establishes a historically informed benchmark of user skepticism and prudent assessment during the advent of Web 3.0, underscoring the necessity of addressing collective psychological, ethical, and normative issues to promote future engagement."}

This shift has triggered urgent debate regarding Anthropomorphism, the attribution of human characteristics to synthetic agents, and its potential to induce misplaced trust or emotional dependency. However, the causal link between more humanlike AI design and subsequent effects on engagement and trust has not been tested in realistic human-AI interactions with a global user pool. Prevailing safety frameworks continue to rely on theoretical assumptions derived from Western populations, overlooking the global diversity of AI users. Here, we address these gaps through two large-scale cross-national experiments (N=3,500) across 10 diverse nations, involving real-time and open-ended interactions with an AI system. We find that when evaluating an AI's human-likeness, users focus less on the kind of theoretical aspects often cited in policy (e.g., sentience or consciousness), but rather applied, interactional cues like conversation flow or understanding the user's perspective. We also experimentally demonstrate that humanlike design levers can causally increase anthropomorphism among users; however, we do not find that humanlike design universally increases behavioral measures for user engagement and trust, as previous theoretical work suggests. Instead, part of the connection between human-likeness and behavioral outcomes is fractured by culture: specific design choices that foster self-reported trust in AI-systems in some populations (e.g., Brazil) may trigger the opposite result in others (e.g., Japan). Our findings challenge prevailing narratives of inherent risk in humanlike AI design. Instead, we identify a nuanced, culturally mediated landscape of human-AI interaction, which demands that we move beyond a one-size-fits-all approach in AI governance."}

To theoretically formalize the desired reasoning behaviors, this paper presents the Laws of Reasoning (LoRe), a unified framework that characterizes intrinsic reasoning patterns in LRMs. We first propose compute law with the hypothesis that the reasoning compute should scale linearly with question complexity. Beyond compute, we extend LoRe with a supplementary accuracy law. Since the question complexity is difficult to quantify in practice, we examine these hypotheses by two properties of the laws, monotonicity and compositionality. We therefore introduce LoRe-Bench, a benchmark that systematically measures these two tractable properties for large reasoning models. Evaluation shows that most reasoning models exhibit reasonable monotonicity but lack compositionality. In response, we develop an effective finetuning approach that enforces compute-law compositionality. Extensive empirical studies demonstrate that better compliance with compute laws yields consistently improved reasoning performance on multiple benchmarks, and uncovers synergistic effects across properties and laws.
