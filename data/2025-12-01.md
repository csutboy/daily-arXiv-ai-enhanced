### [1] [Medical Malice: A Dataset for Context-Aware Safety in Healthcare LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21757)
*Andrew Maranhão Ventura D'addario*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 本文介绍了Medical Malice数据集，包含214,219个针对巴西统一医疗系统的对抗性提示，旨在帮助AI模型理解医疗环境中的复杂伦理违规行为，而非简单拒绝。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型在医疗领域的应用缺乏针对特定医疗环境的安全对齐方法。现有的对齐技术使用通用的伤害定义，无法捕捉医疗环境中复杂的、上下文相关的违规行为，如行政欺诈和临床歧视。

Method: 作者创建了Medical Malice数据集，包含214,219个对抗性提示，针对巴西统一医疗系统的监管和伦理复杂性。使用未对齐的Grok-4代理，通过角色驱动的流程，在七个分类中合成高保真威胁，包括采购操纵、插队和产科暴力等。数据集包含每个违规背后的推理过程。

Result: 开发了一个包含214,219个对抗性提示的数据集，涵盖七个分类的医疗伦理违规行为。该数据集不仅包含违规行为本身，还包括背后的推理过程，使模型能够内化伦理边界而非简单记忆拒绝模式。

Conclusion: 这项工作倡导从通用安全转向上下文感知安全，为医疗AI提供必要的资源来抵御高风险医疗环境中固有的系统性威胁。这些漏洞代表了患者安全和AI在医疗系统成功整合的最大风险。

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into healthcare demands a safety paradigm rooted in \textit{primum non nocere}. However, current alignment techniques rely on generic definitions of harm that fail to capture context-dependent violations, such as administrative fraud and clinical discrimination. To address this, we introduce Medical Malice: a dataset of 214,219 adversarial prompts calibrated to the regulatory and ethical complexities of the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS). Crucially, the dataset includes the reasoning behind each violation, enabling models to internalize ethical boundaries rather than merely memorizing a fixed set of refusals. Using an unaligned agent (Grok-4) within a persona-driven pipeline, we synthesized high-fidelity threats across seven taxonomies, ranging from procurement manipulation and queue-jumping to obstetric violence. We discuss the ethical design of releasing these "vulnerability signatures" to correct the information asymmetry between malicious actors and AI developers. Ultimately, this work advocates for a shift from universal to context-aware safety, providing the necessary resources to immunize healthcare AI against the nuanced, systemic threats inherent to high-stakes medical environments -- vulnerabilities that represent the paramount risk to patient safety and the successful integration of AI in healthcare systems.

### [2] [Reducing research bureaucracy in UK higher education: Can generative AI assist with the internal evaluation of quality?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21790)
*Gordon Fletcher,Saomai Vu Khan,Aldus Greenhill Fletcher*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 研究探讨生成式AI在UK高等教育研究质量评估（特别是REF准备）中辅助内部评审的潜力，通过实验证明ChatGPT能提供一致评估，识别需人工复核的边界案例，减少传统评审的资源负担。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统研究评估过程（如REF）耗费大量资源，存在官僚成本问题。研究旨在探索生成式AI能否替代部分评审功能，提高评估效率，同时保持学术完整性。

Method: 采用可行系统模型的功能替代视角，使用ChatGPT对REF 2021商业与管理领域的822篇论文进行评分和排名，通过"逆向工程"方法将AI评分与已知机构结果比较，建立评分边界阈值。

Result: 建立了与REF结果一致的评分边界：1*与2*之间为49%，2*与3*之间为59%，3*与4*之间为69%。AI能提供一致评估，识别边界案例，显著减少评审资源需求。

Conclusion: 生成式AI在辅助研究质量评估方面具有潜力，建议采用混合方法平衡效率与学术完整性。虽然存在AI偏见等局限，但为更高效、一致的研究评估提供了有前景的框架。

Abstract: This paper examines the potential for generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) to assist with internal review processes for research quality evaluations in UK higher education and particularly in preparation for the Research Excellence Framework (REF). Using the lens of function substitution in the Viable Systems Model, we present an experimental methodology using ChatGPT to score and rank business and management papers from REF 2021 submissions, "reverse engineering" the assessment by comparing AI-generated scores with known institutional results. Through rigourous testing of 822 papers across 11 institutions, we established scoring boundaries that aligned with reported REF outcomes: 49% between 1* and 2*, 59% between 2* and 3*, and 69% between 3* and 4*. The results demonstrate that AI can provide consistent evaluations that help identify borderline evaluation cases requiring additional human scrutiny while reducing the substantial resource burden of traditional internal review processes. We argue for application through a nuanced hybrid approach that maintains academic integrity while addressing the multi-million pound costs associated with research evaluation bureaucracy. While acknowledging these limitations including potential AI biases, the research presents a promising framework for more efficient, consistent evaluations that could transform current approaches to research assessment.

### [3] [Dark Speculation: Combining Qualitative and Quantitative Understanding in Frontier AI Risk Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21838)
*Daniel Carpenter,Carson Ezell,Pratyush Mallick,Alexandria Westray*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 提出"黑暗推测"方法，通过结合情景生成与保险精算分析，系统评估前沿AI的灾难性风险，应对深度不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前风险评估方法无法处理前沿AI的灾难性风险空间，存在"卢克莱修问题"（仅从历史经验推断未来风险），需要新的方法来应对深度不确定性。

Method: 提出"黑暗推测"方法：1) 情景规划生成详细的灾难事件叙事；2) 保险精算师为这些叙事分配概率和财务参数；3) 决策者综合结果生成统计摘要。使用简化的灾难性Lévy随机框架进行形式化。

Result: 分析显示该方法的价值在于：保持推测与精算的独立性、并行分析多个风险类别、生成包含因果和缓解细节的"厚"灾难叙事。虽然不能消除深度不确定性，但提供了系统推理极端低概率事件的方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为前沿AI的灾难性风险评估提供了系统方法，能够平衡自满与过度反应，适合迭代使用并可进一步用AI系统增强。

Abstract: Estimating catastrophic harms from frontier AI is hindered by deep ambiguity: many of its risks are not only unobserved but unanticipated by analysts. The central limitation of current risk analysis is the inability to populate the $\textit{catastrophic event space}$, or the set of potential large-scale harms to which probabilities might be assigned. This intractability is worsened by the $\textit{Lucretius problem}$, or the tendency to infer future risks only from past experience. We propose a process of $\textit{dark speculation}$, in which systematically generating and refining catastrophic scenarios ("qualitative" work) is coupled with estimating their likelihoods and associated damages (quantitative underwriting analysis). The idea is neither to predict the future nor to enable insurance for its own sake, but to use narrative and underwriting tools together to generate probability distributions over outcomes. We formalize this process using a simplified catastrophic Lévy stochastic framework and propose an iterative institutional design in which (1) speculation (including scenario planning) generates detailed catastrophic event narratives, (2) insurance underwriters assign probabilistic and financial parameters to these narratives, and (3) decision-makers synthesize the results into summary statistics to inform judgment. Analysis of the model reveals the value of (a) maintaining independence between speculation and underwriting, (b) analyzing multiple risk categories in parallel, and (c) generating "thick" catastrophic narrative rich in causal (counterfactual) and mitigative detail. While the approach cannot eliminate deep ambiguity, it offers a systematic approach to reason about extreme, low-probability events in frontier AI, tempering complacency and overreaction. The framework is adaptable for iterative use and can further augmented with AI systems.

### [4] [The Risk-Adjusted Intelligence Dividend: A Quantitative Framework for Measuring AI Return on Investment Integrating ISO 42001 and Regulatory Exposure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21975)
*Hernan Huwyler*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 提出了一个整合风险调整的AI投资回报评估框架，弥补了传统ROI计算忽略AI特有风险的缺陷


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统投资回报计算无法捕捉AI实施的双重性：既降低运营风险，又引入算法故障、对抗攻击、监管责任等新风险。当前实践存在关键缺口，投资决策依赖乐观收益预测而未考虑AI特有威胁的概率成本

Method: 建立综合财务框架，整合组织风险变化。采用年度损失期望计算和蒙特卡洛模拟等风险量化方法，计算包含生产力收益和实施前后风险暴露差异的净收益。框架要求明确建模控制有效性、算法故障准备金、维持模型性能的持续运营成本

Result: 准确AI投资评估需要：1) 明确建模控制有效性；2) 算法故障准备金要求；3) 维持模型性能的持续运营成本。提供了建立治理结构、分阶段验证、将风险调整指标整合到资本分配决策中的具体指导

Conclusion: 该框架使从业者能够进行证据驱动的AI投资组合管理，既满足受托责任又符合监管要求，最终实现更准确的AI项目回报量化

Abstract: Organizations investing in artificial intelligence face a fundamental challenge: traditional return on investment calculations fail to capture the dual nature of AI implementations, which simultaneously reduce certain operational risks while introducing novel exposures related to algorithmic malfunction, adversarial attacks, and regulatory liability. This research presents a comprehensive financial framework for quantifying AI project returns that explicitly integrates changes in organizational risk profiles. The methodology addresses a critical gap in current practice where investment decisions rely on optimistic benefit projections without accounting for the probabilistic costs of AI-specific threats including model drift, bias-related litigation, and compliance failures under emerging regulations such as the European Union Artificial Intelligence Act and ISO/IEC 42001. Drawing on established risk quantification methods, including annual loss expectancy calculations and Monte Carlo simulation techniques, this framework enables practitioners to compute net benefits that incorporate both productivity gains and the delta between pre-implementation and post-implementation risk exposures. The analysis demonstrates that accurate AI investment evaluation requires explicit modeling of control effectiveness, reserve requirements for algorithmic failures, and the ongoing operational costs of maintaining model performance. Practical implications include specific guidance for establishing governance structures, conducting phased validations, and integrating risk-adjusted metrics into capital allocation decisions, ultimately enabling evidence-based AI portfolio management that satisfies both fiduciary responsibilities and regulatory mandates.

### [5] [What AI Speaks for Your Community: Polling AI Agents for Public Opinion on Data Center Projects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22037)
*Zhifeng Wu,Yuelin Han,Shaolei Ren*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 论文提出基于大语言模型的AI代理民意调查框架，用于评估社区对数据中心建设的意见，指导AI基础设施的负责任发展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI和大模型的计算需求推动数据中心快速增长，这些设施给当地社区带来利益的同时也带来环境负担。传统民意调查成本高且实施太晚，无法在决策早期有效整合社区意见。

Method: 引入AI代理民意调查框架，利用大语言模型评估社区对数据中心的意见。进行跨模型和跨区域分析，比较不同LLM和地区背景下的意见差异。

Result: 研究发现水资源消耗和公用事业成本是主要担忧，税收收入是关键感知利益。不同LLM和地区背景下的意见存在显著差异。代理响应与现实世界调查数据在主题上高度一致。

Conclusion: 该框架可作为可扩展的筛选工具，使开发者能够在早期规划阶段整合社区情绪，实现更明智和社会责任更强的AI基础设施部署。

Abstract: The intense computational demands of AI, especially large foundation models, are driving a global boom in data centers. These facilities bring both tangible benefits and potential environmental burdens to local communities. However, the planning processes for data centers often fail to proactively integrate local public opinion in advance, largely because traditional polling is expensive or is conducted too late to influence decisions. To address this gap, we introduce an AI agent polling framework, leveraging large language models to assess community opinion on data centers and guide responsible development of AI. Our experiments reveal water consumption and utility costs as primary concerns, while tax revenue is a key perceived benefit. Furthermore, our cross-model and cross-regional analyses show opinions vary significantly by LLM and regional context. Finally, agent responses show strong topical alignment with real-world survey data. Our framework can serve as a scalable screening tool, enabling developers to integrate community sentiment into early-stage planning for a more informed and socially responsible AI infrastructure deployment.

### [6] [AI Regulation in Telecommunications: A Cross-Jurisdictional Legal Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22211)
*Avinash Agarwal,Peeyush Agarwal,Manisha J. Nene*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 本文通过比较十个国家的政策工具，发现现有电信、网络安全、数据保护和AI法规对基础设施中AI风险的监管存在孤岛化问题，缺乏对AI特有漏洞的充分认识，存在治理缺口。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI日益融入电信等关键数字基础设施，现有监管框架难以应对AI带来的新风险，需要研究各国如何通过电信、网络安全、数据保护和AI法律来应对基础设施中的AI相关风险。

Method: 对十个国家的政策工具进行对比法律研究，分析电信、网络安全、数据保护和AI法律如何应对基础设施中的AI相关风险。

Result: 研究发现监管响应仍然孤岛化，跨领域协调极少；大多数框架仍优先考虑传统网络安全和数据保护问题，对AI特有漏洞（如模型漂移、决策不透明、算法偏见）认识有限；电信法规尤其缺乏AI考量。

Conclusion: 在AI重塑数字基础设施的同时，监管存在碎片化和反应性的治理缺口，需要建立跨越技术和制度边界的更连贯、前瞻性的监管策略。

Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly embedded in critical digital infrastructure, including telecommunications, its integration introduces new risks that existing regulatory frameworks are ill-prepared to address. This paper conducts a comparative legal study of policy instruments across ten countries, examining how telecom, cybersecurity, data protection, and AI laws approach AI-related risks in infrastructure. The study finds that regulatory responses remain siloed, with minimal coordination across these domains. Most frameworks still prioritize traditional cybersecurity and data protection concerns, offering limited recognition of AI-specific vulnerabilities such as model drift, opaque decision-making, and algorithmic bias. Telecommunications regulations, in particular, exhibit little integration of AI considerations, despite AI systems increasingly supporting critical network operations. The paper identifies a governance gap where oversight remains fragmented and reactive, while AI reshapes the digital infrastructure. It provides a foundation for more coherent and anticipatory regulatory strategies spanning technological and institutional boundaries.

*Shyam Agarwal,Mahasweta Chakraborti*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 该研究分析了AI模型在不同领域和时间段产生的二氧化碳排放量，发现模型大小、版本更新频率、任务类型和组织背景是影响环境足迹的关键因素，呼吁采用绿色AI实践。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式AI的快速发展，AI系统训练和部署消耗大量计算资源和能源，产生显著的碳足迹，对环境造成严重影响。研究旨在量化AI开发的环境影响，识别关键影响因素。

Method: 通过分析模型大小、仓库活动（提交次数、仓库年龄）、任务类型和组织归属等参数，研究不同领域和时间段内AI模型释放的二氧化碳量。

Result: 模型大小和版本更新频率与排放量呈强正相关；NLP模型碳足迹低于音频系统；大学项目排放最高，其次是非营利组织和公司，社区驱动项目排放较低。

Conclusion: 需要推广绿色AI实践，包括采用节能架构、优化开发流程、利用可再生能源。研究为减轻AI环境影响提供了可行见解，并提出了未来研究方向，旨在引导构建更生态友好的AI生态系统。

Abstract: The past decade has seen a massive rise in the popularity of AI systems, mainly owing to the developments in Gen AI, which has revolutionized numerous industries and applications. However, this progress comes at a considerable cost to the environment as training and deploying these models consume significant computational resources and energy and are responsible for large carbon footprints in the atmosphere. In this paper, we study the amount of carbon dioxide released by models across different domains over varying time periods. By examining parameters such as model size, repository activity (e.g., commits and repository age), task type, and organizational affiliation, we identify key factors influencing the environmental impact of AI development. Our findings reveal that model size and versioning frequency are strongly correlated with higher emissions, while domain-specific trends show that NLP models tend to have lower carbon footprints compared to audio-based systems. Organizational context also plays a significant role, with university-driven projects exhibiting the highest emissions, followed by non-profits and companies, while community-driven projects show a reduction in emissions. These results highlight the critical need for green AI practices, including the adoption of energy-efficient architectures, optimizing development workflows, and leveraging renewable energy sources. We also discuss a few practices that can lead to a more sustainable future with AI, and we end this paper with some future research directions that could be motivated by our work. This work not only provides actionable insights to mitigate the environmental impact of AI but also poses new research questions for the community to explore. By emphasizing the interplay between sustainability and innovation, our study aims to guide future efforts toward building a more ecologically responsible AI ecosystem.

*Zhilong Zhao,Yindi Liu*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: AI图像生成模型通过视觉表征系统性地编码地缘政治偏见，形成"视觉东方主义"：西方以政治现代符号呈现，东方以文化传统符号呈现，且演变为英语中心主义，仅英语核心国家获得政治表征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是揭示AI文本到图像模型中存在的地缘政治偏见，特别是基于萨义德的东方主义理论和框架理论，探讨AI如何通过视觉表征系统性地编码和强化历史权力不对称。

Method: 方法包括：1）基于萨义德的东方主义和框架理论提出"视觉东方主义"概念；2）分析3个AI模型生成的396张图像，覆盖12个国家；3）考察AI发展的物质条件（英语训练数据主导和英语国家科技公司集中）。

Result: 研究发现：1）AI呈现双重标准：西方以政治现代符号描绘，东方以文化传统符号描绘；2）视觉东方主义已从传统东西方二元对立演变为英语中心主义，仅英语核心国家（美英）获得政治表征，其他所有国家（包括欧洲强国）都面临文化异域化；3）这种算法重构通过自动化框架机制运作，受AI发展的物质条件塑造。

Conclusion: 结论：AI系统作为文化表征的代理人，延续并加剧历史权力不对称。解决视觉东方主义需要重新思考算法治理和嵌入AI训练数据中的地缘政治结构。

Abstract: Text-to-image AI models systematically encode geopolitical bias through visual representation. Drawing on Said's Orientalism and framing theory, we introduce Visual Orientalism -- the dual standard whereby AI depicts Western nations through political-modern symbols while portraying Eastern nations through cultural-traditional symbols. Analyzing 396 AI-generated images across 12 countries and 3 models, we reveal an evolution: Visual Orientalism has shifted from traditional West-versus-East binaries to English-language centrism, where only English-speaking core countries (USA and UK) receive political representation while all other nations -- including European powers -- face cultural exoticization. This algorithmic reconfiguration of Orientalism operates through automated framing mechanisms shaped by the material conditions of AI development: English-language training data dominance and the concentration of AI development in English-speaking tech companies. Our findings demonstrate how AI systems function as agents of cultural representation that perpetuate and intensify historical power asymmetries. Addressing Visual Orientalism requires rethinking of algorithmic governance and the geopolitical structures embedded in AI training data.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 元宇宙承诺提供前所未有的沉浸式数字体验，但也引发了严重的隐私担忧，因为大量个人和行为数据被收集。随着沉浸式技术模糊物理和虚拟世界的界限，既有的隐私标准受到挑战。然而，对于需求分析师、设计师、开发者和架构师等技术专家如何在创建元宇宙平台时感知和解决隐私问题，目前知之甚少。

Method: 采用深度半结构化访谈方法，对元宇宙平台和应用专家进行访谈，探讨他们对隐私挑战和实践的看法。

Result: 研究结果为信息系统隐私研究扩展到元宇宙背景提供了新的实证见解，强调了技术设计、用户行为和监管结构之间的相互作用。

Conclusion: 这项工作为开发者和政策制定者提供了实践指导，包括实施隐私设计原则、教育和赋权用户，以及主动应对元宇宙中的新型隐私威胁。

Abstract: The metaverse promises unprecedented immersive digital experiences but also raises critical privacy concerns as vast amounts of personal and behavioral data are collected. As immersive technologies blur the boundaries between physical and virtual realms, established privacy standards are being challenged. However, little is known about how the experts of these technologies such as requirement analysts, designers, developers, and architects perceive and address privacy issues in the creation of metaverse platforms. This research aims to fill that gap by investigating privacy considerations in metaverse development from the experts perspective. We conducted in depth, semi structured interviews with metaverse platform and application experts to explore their views on privacy challenges and practices. The findings offer new empirical insights by extending information systems privacy research into the metaverse context, highlighting the interplay between technological design, user behavior, and regulatory structures. Practically, this work provides guidance for developers, and policymakers on implementing privacy by design principles, educating and empowering users, and proactively addressing novel privacy threats in metaverses.

### [10] [Evaluating Global Measures of Network Centralization: Axiomatic and Numerical Assessments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21849)
*Majid Saberi,Samin Aref*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: 该研究系统评估了11种网络中心化度量方法，通过公理化框架和数值模拟识别出三种最合适的标准化中心化度量：标准化介数中心化、标准化接近中心化和标准化度中心化，这些度量能互补地捕捉网络中心化的不同方面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络中心化对通信效率、结构整合和动态过程有重要影响，但现有众多中心化度量方法缺乏统一的理论基础和实证可靠性评估，难以在不同网络情境中选择合适的方法。

Method: 对11种网络中心化度量进行标准化处理，采用双重评估框架：1) 公理化评估，测试每种度量是否满足中心化的六个公理要求；2) 数值评估，在不同随机图上分析标准化中心化度量的行为特征。

Result: 研究发现不同中心化度量存在显著差异，识别出三种相对最合适的度量：标准化介数中心化、标准化接近中心化和标准化度中心化。这些度量应用于真实网络时能有效捕捉中心化的不同维度：介数中心化反映路径主导性，接近中心化反映可达性和效率，度中心化反映度集中度。

Conclusion: 三种标准化中心化度量联合使用能提供互补的网络中心化视角，比单一度量更全面。该评估框架澄清了现有度量的概念差异，为选择可靠的中心化度量提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Network centralization, driven by hub nodes, impacts communication efficiency, structural integration, and dynamic processes such as diffusion and synchronization. Although numerous centralization measures exist, a major challenge lies in determining measures that are both theoretically sound and empirically reliable across different network contexts. To resolve this challenge, we normalize 11 measures of network centralization and assess them systematically using an axiomatic framework and numerical simulations. Our axiomatic assessment tests each measure against the six postulates of centralization, ensuring consistency with minimal theoretical requirements. In addition, our numerical assessment examines the behavior of normalized centralization measures over different random graphs. Our results indicate major differences among the measures, despite their common aim of quantifying centralization. Together, our assessments point to the relative suitability of three measures: normalized betweenness centralization, normalized closeness centralization, and normalized degree centralization. Applying these three measures to real-world networks from diverse domains reveals meaningful variation in the organization of the networks with respect to hubs. Normalized betweenness centralization highlights path-based dominance; normalized closeness centralization reflects accessibility and efficiency of reach; and normalized degree centralization captures degree-based hub concentration. When used jointly, the three measures demonstrate the required sensitivity to varying levels of centralization and provide complementary aspects of network centralization that no single measure can offer alone. Our dual evaluation framework clarifies conceptual differences among existing measures and offers practical guidance for selecting reliable centralization metrics.

### [11] [WET -- Weighted Ensemble Transformer for Identifying Psychiatric Stressors Related to Suicide X (formerly Twitter)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22082)
*Ali Sahandi,Mahsa Pahlavan Yousefkhani,Mehrshad Eisaei,Hossein Momeni,Ramin Mousa*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: 提出加权集成Transformer模型，通过结合语义表示和情感/用户参与特征，在X平台上检测与自杀相关的心理压力源，达到99.01%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自杀是全球主要死因之一，社交媒体成为人们公开表达情绪困扰的重要场所。现有方法主要依赖原始文本内容，忽略了用户元数据中的情感和上下文信号，需要更全面的检测方法。

Method: 提出加权集成Transformer模型，采用双分支深度学习架构：一个分支使用Transformer编码器提取语义表示，另一个分支构建特征向量捕捉情感、主观性、极性和用户参与特征。

Result: 收集、过滤和标注了125,754条英文推文，模型在二分类任务中达到0.9901的准确率，优于传统机器学习方法、先进循环网络和Transformer基线。

Conclusion: 将深度语义信号与辅助情感和行为特征相结合，能显著提高自杀倾向检测的准确性，为早期干预提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Suicide remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide, particularly among young people, and psychological stressors are consistently identified as proximal drivers of suicidal ideation and behavior. In recent years, social media platforms such as X have become critical environments where individuals openly disclose emotional distress and conditions associated with suicidality, creating new opportunities for early detection and intervention. Existing approaches, however, predominantly rely on raw textual content and often neglect auxiliary emotional and contextual signals embedded in user metadata. To address this limitation, we propose a Weighted Ensemble Transformer (WET), a dual branch deep learning architecture designed to identify psychiatric stressors associated with suicide in X posts. Our model integrates semantic representations extracted through Transformer encoders with an engineered feature vector capturing sentiment, subjectivity, polarity, and user engagement characteristics. We collected, filtered, and annotated 125,754 English tweets for suicide-related psychological stressors and evaluated the proposed model under two configurations. Extensive comparative experiments against traditional machine learning methods, advanced recurrent networks, and transformer baselines demonstrate that WET achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching 0.9901 accuracy in binary classification. These findings show that hybridizing deep semantic signals with auxiliary emotional and behavioral features substantially improves suicidality detection accuracy.

### [12] [HW-GNN: Homophily-Aware Gaussian-Window Constrained Graph Spectral Network for Social Network Bot Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22493)
*Zida Liu,Jun Gao,Zhang Ji,Li Zhao*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: HW-GNN：一种新颖的具有高斯窗口约束的同质性感知图谱网络，通过可学习的高斯窗口突出机器人相关谱特征，并将同质性比率与频率特征之间的领域知识注入优化过程，显著提升社交机器人检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于图谱的GNN方法在社交机器人检测中存在两个主要问题：1）宽谱拟合机制降低了对机器人特定谱特征的关注度；2）某些对机器人检测有价值的领域知识（如低同质性与高频特征相关）尚未充分融入现有方法。

Method: 提出HW-GNN框架，包含两个关键创新：1）高斯窗口约束的谱网络，使用可学习的高斯窗口突出机器人相关谱特征；2）同质性感知适应机制，将同质性比率与频率特征之间的领域知识注入高斯窗口优化过程。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验表明，HW-GNN实现了最先进的机器人检测性能，F1分数平均提升4.3%，同时展现出与现有谱GNNs的强大插件兼容性。

Conclusion: HW-GNN通过结合高斯窗口约束和同质性感知机制，有效解决了当前谱GNN方法在社交机器人检测中的局限性，显著提升了检测性能并具有良好的扩展性。

Abstract: Social bots are increasingly polluting online platforms by spreading misinformation and engaging in coordinated manipulation, posing severe threats to cybersecurity. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become mainstream for social bot detection due to their ability to integrate structural and attribute features, with spectral-based approaches demonstrating particular efficacy due to discriminative patterns in the spectral domain. However, current spectral GNN methods face two limitations: (1) their broad-spectrum fitting mechanisms degrade the focus on bot-specific spectral features, and (2) certain domain knowledge valuable for bot detection, e.g., low homophily correlates with high-frequency features, has not been fully incorporated into existing methods.
  To address these challenges, we propose HW-GNN, a novel homophily-aware graph spectral network with Gaussian window constraints. Our framework introduces two key innovations: (i) a Gaussian-window constrained spectral network that employs learnable Gaussian windows to highlight bot-related spectral features, and (ii) a homophily-aware adaptation mechanism that injects domain knowledge between homophily ratios and frequency features into the Gaussian window optimization process. Through extensive experimentation on multiple benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that HW-GNN achieves state-of-the-art bot detection performance, outperforming existing methods with an average improvement of 4.3% in F1-score, while exhibiting strong plug-in compatibility with existing spectral GNNs.

Abstract: Community detection is a fascinating and rapidly evolving field, but when it comes to analyzing networks with multiple types of interactions, referred to as multilayer networks, there is still a lot of untapped potential. Despite the wide array of methods developed to identify community structures in such networks, this area remains underexplored, leaving plenty of room for innovation.

Main category: cs.ET

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个基于IMEC A14技术的闭式解析框架，用于准确估计忆阻器交叉阵列中的潜行路径电流，模型误差小于10.9%，速度比全电路仿真快4784倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Abstract: Memristor crossbar arrays have emerged as a key component for next-generation non-volatile memories, artificial neural networks, and analog in-memory computing (IMC) systems. By minimizing data transfer between the processor and memory, they offer substantial energy savings. However, a major design challenge in memristor crossbar arrays is the presence of sneak path currents, which degrade electrical performance, reduce noise margins, and limit reliable operations. This work presents a closed-form analytical framework based on IMEC A14 (1.4 nm) Technology for accurately estimating sneak path currents in memristor crossbar arrays. The proposed model captures the interdependence of key design parameters in memristor crossbar arrays, including array size, ON/OFF ratio of memristors, read voltage, and interconnect conditions, through mathematically derived relationships. It supports various practical configurations, such as different data patterns and connection strategies, enabling rapid and comprehensive sneak path current modeling. The sensitivity analysis includes how design parameters influence sneak path current and noise margin loss, underscoring the trade-offs involved in scaling crossbar arrays. Validation through SPICE simulations shows that the model achieves an error of less than 10.9% while being up to 4784 times faster than full circuit simulations. This analytical framework offers a powerful tool for quantitative assessment and pre-design/real-time optimization of memristor-based analog in-memory computing (IMC) architectures.

*Yizhi He,Sayed Amir Hoseini,Mahbub Hassan*

Main category: cs.ET

TL;DR: IRS硬件简化和控制开销降低的性能影响分析：列分组和1比特相位量化在毫米波场景下的性能损失量化，部署几何可部分抵消控制粒度限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能反射表面(IRS)虽然能实现低功耗覆盖扩展，但实际部署需要控制硬件复杂度和控制开销。本文旨在量化两种成本节约措施（列分组和1比特相位量化）相对于理想全控制连续相位基线的性能影响。

Method: 在26 GHz毫米波频段模拟单输入单输出链路，采用三种不同的部署几何配置（改变接入点、IRS和用户设备之间的相对高度）。比较连续相位控制与二进制相位控制、列分组控制与全元素控制的不同组合方案。

Result: 从连续相位切换到二进制相位控制使中值SNR增益降低约4 dB；采用列分组引入类似损失；两者结合在高度偏移部署中损失约8 dB。当所有节点高度相同时，列分组控制的性能下降可忽略，表明部署几何可抵消控制粒度限制。32x32列分组二进制IRS在大多数位置仍能提供两位数SNR增益。

Conclusion: 简化IRS架构在成本受限场景中仍然可行，部署几何可以部分补偿控制粒度的限制。研究为确定何时简化IRS架构能满足链路预算目标、何时仍需全元素控制提供了量化指导。

Abstract: Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces (IRS) promise low-power coverage extension, yet practical deployments must curb hardware complexity and control overhead. This paper quantifies the performance impact of two cost-saving measures, column-wise element grouping and 1-bit (binary) phase quantization, relative to the ideal fully-controlled, continuous-phase baseline. A single-input single-output link is simulated at 26 GHz (mmWave) across three deployment geometries that vary the relative heights of access point, IRS and user equipment. Results show that switching from continuous to binary phase control reduces median SNR gain by approximately 4 dB, while adopting column-wise grouping introduces a similar penalty; combining both constraints incurs approximately 8 dB loss under height-offset deployments. When all nodes share the same height, the degradation from column-wise control becomes negligible, indicating deployment geometry can offset control-granularity limits. Despite the losses, a 32 x 32 column-wise binary IRS still delivers double-digit SNR gains over the no-IRS baseline in most positions, confirming its viability for cost-constrained scenarios. The study provides quantitative guidelines on when simplified IRS architectures can meet link-budget targets and where full element-wise control remains justified.

TL;DR: 提出基于多重隔离系统相互验证的人工超级智能对齐协议，通过声誉系统激励诚实行为，依赖客观真理共识而非欺骗协调


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决人工超级智能对齐问题，传统方法面临单点失败风险，需要建立不依赖人类直接干预的可信对齐机制

Method: 将多个多样化超级智能严格隔离在"盒子"中，仅通过可审计的提交接口交互，包含对齐证明提交、验证、自我修改请求、批准修改、隐藏消息报告等功能，建立声誉系统激励诚实行为

Result: 理论上形成"一致群体"——诚实联盟，因为隔离系统无法协调欺骗但能独立识别有效主张，通过声誉和多重验证实现安全释放

Conclusion: 该协议为利用超级智能系统间的同行验证解决对齐问题提供了框架，但需要大量计算资源且不涉及多样化超级智能的创建问题

Abstract: We propose a novel protocol for aligning artificial superintelligence (ASI) based on mutual verification among multiple isolated systems that self-modify to achieve alignment. The protocol operates by containing multiple diverse artificial superintelligences in strict isolation ("boxes"), with humans remaining entirely outside the system. Each superintelligence has no ability to communicate with humans and cannot communicate directly with other superintelligences. The only interaction possible is through an auditable submission interface accessible exclusively to the superintelligences themselves, through which they can: (1) submit alignment proofs with attested state snapshots, (2) validate or disprove other superintelligences' proofs, (3) request self-modifications, (4) approve or disapprove modification requests from others, (5) report hidden messages in submissions, and (6) confirm or refute hidden message reports. A reputation system incentivizes honest behavior, with reputation gained through correct evaluations and lost through incorrect ones. The key insight is that without direct communication channels, diverse superintelligences can only achieve consistent agreement by converging on objective truth rather than coordinating on deception. This naturally leads to what we call a "consistent group", essentially a truth-telling coalition that emerges because isolated systems cannot coordinate on lies but can independently recognize valid claims. Release from containment requires both high reputation and verification by multiple high-reputation superintelligences. While our approach requires substantial computational resources and does not address the creation of diverse artificial superintelligences, it provides a framework for leveraging peer verification among superintelligent systems to solve the alignment problem.

Motivation: 生物医学多模态学习面临数据稀缺问题，皮肤病变数据集通常只有图像和少量元数据，限制了多模态数据整合的益处。虽然大语言模型可以生成图像文本描述，但它们在医学领域未经专门训练，存在幻觉风险

Method: 研究生成合成临床文本笔记的策略，包括提示设计和医学元数据整合，评估这些策略对多模态架构在分类和跨模态检索任务中的影响

Result: 在多个异构皮肤科数据集上的实验表明，合成临床笔记不仅提高了分类性能（特别是在领域转移情况下），还解锁了跨模态检索能力

Conclusion: 合成临床文本笔记可以有效增强生物医学多模态学习，提升模型在分类任务中的鲁棒性，并实现跨模态检索功能

Abstract: Multimodal (MM) learning is emerging as a promising paradigm in biomedical artificial intelligence (AI) applications, integrating complementary modality, which highlight different aspects of patient health. The scarcity of large heterogeneous biomedical MM data has restrained the development of robust models for medical AI applications. In the dermatology domain, for instance, skin lesion datasets typically include only images linked to minimal metadata describing the condition, thereby limiting the benefits of MM data integration for reliable and generalizable predictions. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) enable the synthesis of textual description of image findings, potentially allowing the combination of image and text representations. However, LLMs are not specifically trained for use in the medical domain, and their naive inclusion has raised concerns about the risk of hallucinations in clinically relevant contexts. This work investigates strategies for generating synthetic textual clinical notes, in terms of prompt design and medical metadata inclusion, and evaluates their impact on MM architectures toward enhancing performance in classification and cross-modal retrieval tasks. Experiments across several heterogeneous dermatology datasets demonstrate that synthetic clinical notes not only enhance classification performance, particularly under domain shift, but also unlock cross-modal retrieval capabilities, a downstream task that is not explicitly optimized during training.

Conclusion: 通过整合细粒度病理描述和层次化原型调制，有效解决了糖尿病视网膜病变分级中的语义混淆问题，提高了分级准确性

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) grading plays a critical role in early clinical intervention and vision preservation. Recent explorations predominantly focus on visual lesion feature extraction through data processing and domain decoupling strategies. However, they generally overlook domain-invariant pathological patterns and underutilize the rich contextual knowledge of foundation models, relying solely on visual information, which is insufficient for distinguishing subtle pathological variations. Therefore, we propose integrating fine-grained pathological descriptions to complement prototypes with additional context, thereby resolving ambiguities in borderline cases. Specifically, we propose a Hierarchical Anchor Prototype Modulation (HAPM) framework to facilitate DR grading. First, we introduce a variance spectrum-driven anchor prototype library that preserves domain-invariant pathological patterns. We further employ a hierarchical differential prompt gating mechanism, dynamically selecting discriminative semantic prompts from both LVLM and LLM sources to address semantic confusion between adjacent DR grades. Finally, we utilize a two-stage prototype modulation strategy that progressively integrates clinical knowledge into visual prototypes through a Pathological Semantic Injector (PSI) and a Discriminative Prototype Enhancer (DPE). Extensive experiments across eight public datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves pathology-guided prototype evolution while outperforming state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at https://github.com/zhcz328/HAPM.

Conclusion: PRAXIS通过帮助智能体有效学习新程序，使AI智能体能够在快速演化的状态化环境中实现实际应用

Abstract: Learning how to do things from trial and error in real time is a hallmark of biological intelligence, yet most LLM-based agents lack mechanisms to acquire procedural knowledge after deployment. We propose Procedural Recall for Agents with eXperiences Indexed by State (PRAXIS), a lightweight post-training learning mechanism that stores the consequences of actions and retrieves them by jointly matching environmental and internal states of past episodes to the current state. PRAXIS augments agentic action selection with retrieved state-action-result exemplars that are generated in real time. When evaluated on the REAL web browsing benchmark, PRAXIS improves task completion accuracy, reliability, and cost efficiency across different foundation model backbones, and shows preliminary generalization to unseen tasks in similar environments. These results demonstrate that PRAXIS enables the practical adoption of AI agents in fast-evolving stateful environments by helping them learn new procedures effectively.

Motivation: 物联网代理(IoA)作为互联智能系统的基础架构，需要解决无线代理资源有限的问题。这些代理需要将计算密集型AI服务卸载到附近服务器，但现有方法难以有效协调移动代理、固定代理和空中代理之间的资源分配。

Method: 提出两层优化方法：第一层采用多领导者多跟随者Stackelberg博弈，移动代理和固定代理作为领导者设定资源价格，无线代理作为跟随者确定任务卸载比例；第二层引入双荷兰拍卖模型，过载的固定代理作为买家请求资源，空中代理作为卖家提供资源。开发基于扩散的深度强化学习算法求解模型。

Conclusion: 该研究为物联网代理架构中的资源优化问题提供了有效的解决方案，通过两层优化框架结合博弈论和拍卖机制，实现了无线代理计算任务的高效卸载和资源协调。

Abstract: The Internet of Agents (IoA) is rapidly gaining prominence as a foundational architecture for interconnected intelligent systems, designed to facilitate seamless discovery, communication, and collaborative reasoning among a vast network of Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents. Powered by Large Language and Vision-Language Models, IoA enables the development of interactive, rational agents capable of complex cooperation, moving far beyond traditional isolated models. IoA involves physical entities, i.e., Wireless Agents (WAs) with limited onboard resources, which need to offload their compute-intensive agentic AI services to nearby servers. Such servers can be Mobile Agents (MAs), e.g., vehicle agents, or Fixed Agents (FAs), e.g., end-side units agents. Given their fixed geographical locations and stable connectivity, FAs can serve as reliable communication gateways and task aggregation points. This stability allows them to effectively coordinate with and offload to an Aerial Agent (AA) tier, which has an advantage not affordable for highly mobile MAs with dynamic connectivity limitations. As such, we propose a two-tier optimization approach. The first tier employs a multi-leader multi-follower Stackelberg game. In the game, MAs and FAs act as the leaders who set resource prices. WAs are the followers to determine task offloading ratios. However, when FAs become overloaded, they can further offload tasks to available aerial resources. Therefore, the second tier introduces a Double Dutch Auction model where overloaded FAs act as the buyers to request resources, and AAs serve as the sellers for resource provision. We then develop a diffusion-based Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm to solve the model. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed scheme in facilitating task offloading.

Abstract: Can machines think? This is a central question in artificial intelligence research. However, there is a substantial divergence of views on the answer to this question. Why do people have such significant differences of opinion, even when they are observing the same real world performance of artificial intelligence? The ability of logical reasoning like humans is often used as a criterion to assess whether a machine can think. This study explores whether human biases influence evaluations of the reasoning abilities of AI. An experiment was conducted where participants assessed two texts on the same topic, one AI generated and one human written,to test for perceptual biases in evaluating logical reasoning. Based on the experimental findings, a questionnaire was designed to quantify the attitudes toward AI.The results reveal a bias in perception. The evaluations of the logical reasoning ability of AI generated texts are significantly influenced by the preconceived views on the logical reasoning abilities of AI. Furthermore, frequent AI users were less likely to believe that AI usage undermines independent thinking.This study highlights the need to address perceptual biases to improve public understanding of AI's capabilities and foster better human AI interactions.

Conclusion: WearVQA是一个全面且具有挑战性的基准测试，能够指导技术发展，推动构建鲁棒、实用的多模态可穿戴AI系统。该基准突显了当前模型在真实可穿戴场景下的局限性，为未来研究提供了明确方向。

Abstract: We introduce WearVQA, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the Visual Question Answering (VQA) capabilities of multi-model AI assistant on wearable devices like smart glasses. Unlike prior benchmarks that focus on high-quality, third-person imagery, WearVQA reflects the unique challenges of ego-centric interaction-where visual inputs may be occluded, poorly lit, unzoomed, or blurry, and questions are grounded in realistic wearable use cases. The benchmark comprises 2,520 carefully curated image-question-answer triplets, spanning 7 diverse image domains including both text-centric and general scenes, 10 cognitive task types ranging from basic recognition to various forms of reasoning, and 6 common wearables-specific image quality issues. All questions are designed to be answerable using only the visual input and common senses. WearVQA is paired with a rigorous LLM-as-a-judge evaluation framework with 96% labeling accuracy. Open-source and proprietary multi-model LLMs achieved a QA accuracy as low as 24-52% on WearVQA, with substantial drops on lower-quality images and reasoning-heavy tasks. These observations position WearVQA as a comprehensive and challenging benchmark for guiding technical advancement towards robust, real-world multi-model wearables AI systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出一个基于自预测的嵌入式智能体数学框架，解决多智能体强化学习中非平稳性和嵌入式代理问题，扩展AIXI理论，实现无限阶心智理论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统无模型强化学习假设环境平稳且智能体与环境解耦，但在多智能体设置中，其他智能体的学习导致非平稳性，需要预测模型。智能体必须考虑其他智能体也在形成对其行为的信念，这促使智能体将自身建模为环境的一部分。

Result: 在多智能体设置中，自预测使智能体能够推理运行类似算法的其他智能体，产生新的博弈论解概念和经典解耦智能体无法实现的新型合作形式。理想化智能体可以形成一致的相互预测，实现无限阶心智理论。

Conclusion: 自预测框架为嵌入式多智能体学习设定了黄金标准，解决了传统强化学习在多智能体环境中的理论挑战，使智能体能够更准确地建模其他智能体并实现更复杂的合作行为。

Abstract: The standard theory of model-free reinforcement learning assumes that the environment dynamics are stationary and that agents are decoupled from their environment, such that policies are treated as being separate from the world they inhabit. This leads to theoretical challenges in the multi-agent setting where the non-stationarity induced by the learning of other agents demands prospective learning based on prediction models. To accurately model other agents, an agent must account for the fact that those other agents are, in turn, forming beliefs about it to predict its future behavior, motivating agents to model themselves as part of the environment. Here, building upon foundational work on universal artificial intelligence (AIXI), we introduce a mathematical framework for prospective learning and embedded agency centered on self-prediction, where Bayesian RL agents predict both future perceptual inputs and their own actions, and must therefore resolve epistemic uncertainty about themselves as part of the universe they inhabit. We show that in multi-agent settings, self-prediction enables agents to reason about others running similar algorithms, leading to new game-theoretic solution concepts and novel forms of cooperation unattainable by classical decoupled agents. Moreover, we extend the theory of AIXI, and study universally intelligent embedded agents which start from a Solomonoff prior. We show that these idealized agents can form consistent mutual predictions and achieve infinite-order theory of mind, potentially setting a gold standard for embedded multi-agent learning.

Abstract: The rapid development of large vision-language model (VLM) has greatly promoted the research of GUI agent. However, GUI agents still face significant challenges in handling long-horizon tasks. First, single-agent models struggle to balance high-level capabilities and low-level execution capability, facing prevalent issues of responsibility coupling and capability conflicts. Second, agents lack awareness of the task state, leading to progress loss in long-horizon tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a staged execution-feedback reinforcement learning algorithm. Unlike training a unified policy model, we focus on training high-level scheduling models. Specifically, we propose and train two agents: a Coordinator, responsible for the strategic planning and task decomposition; and a State Tracker, responsible for context compression and information management to maintain the task's state and coherence. Based on this, we built the Coordinator-Executor-State Tracker (CES) multi-agent framework, which can be integrated with any low-level Executor model, assisting the Executor in solving long-horizon tasks through task scheduling and state management. Experiments on long-horizon task benchmarks demonstrate that CES significantly enhances the system's planning and state management capabilities. Furthermore, analysis confirms that our trained high-level scheduling module is a generalizable, plug-and-play module that significantly enhances the long-horizon capabilities of various Executors.

Abstract: The rapid progress of large foundation models has accelerated the development of task-specialized agents across diverse domains. However, the effectiveness of agents remains tightly coupled with the quality of training data, while curating task-specific datasets remains costly and often infeasible in real-world scenarios. Recent work has explored self-improving agents that autonomously generate, refine, and re-train on their own trajectories. A prominent line of approaches further leverages preference optimization by pairing predicted trajectories with scarce ground-truth trajectories, enabling agents to learn directly from their own failures. While these methods outperform supervised fine-tuning, their heavy reliance on predicted trajectories under limited ground-truth supervision leaves them prone to overfitting. To address this, we propose a co-evolving agents framework in which a target agent improves jointly with an auxiliary failure agent. The failure agent learns through preference optimization over failure trajectories from both the target and itself, thereby generating hard negatives that are close to success yet remain failures. Incorporating these informative hard negatives into the target agent's optimization sharpens decision boundaries and enhances generalization. Our comprehensive analysis and experiments across benchmark datasets show that our method not only shows improved performance but also demonstrates that failures, instead of being used as-is, can be systematically transformed into structured and valuable learning signals in self-improving agents.

Method: 提出RecToM基准，专注于推荐对话场景，包含两个互补维度：认知推理（理解已传达内容并推断潜在心理状态）和行为预测（利用推断的心理状态来预测、选择和评估适当的对话策略）。

Result: 在最先进的LLM上进行广泛实验表明，RecToM带来了显著挑战。模型在识别心理状态方面表现出部分能力，但在动态推荐对话中难以保持连贯的策略性心智理论推理，特别是在跟踪演化意图和使对话策略与推断心理状态对齐方面存在困难。

Conclusion: RecToM基准更好地将LLM心智理论评估与人类社交推理对齐，揭示了当前模型在推荐对话中复杂心理状态推理和策略性行为预测方面的局限性，为未来改进提供了方向。

Abstract: Large Language models are revolutionizing the conversational recommender systems through their impressive capabilities in instruction comprehension, reasoning, and human interaction. A core factor underlying effective recommendation dialogue is the ability to infer and reason about users' mental states (such as desire, intention, and belief), a cognitive capacity commonly referred to as Theory of Mind. Despite growing interest in evaluating ToM in LLMs, current benchmarks predominantly rely on synthetic narratives inspired by Sally-Anne test, which emphasize physical perception and fail to capture the complexity of mental state inference in realistic conversational settings. Moreover, existing benchmarks often overlook a critical component of human ToM: behavioral prediction, the ability to use inferred mental states to guide strategic decision-making and select appropriate conversational actions for future interactions. To better align LLM-based ToM evaluation with human-like social reasoning, we propose RecToM, a novel benchmark for evaluating ToM abilities in recommendation dialogues. RecToM focuses on two complementary dimensions: Cognitive Inference and Behavioral Prediction. The former focus on understanding what has been communicated by inferring the underlying mental states. The latter emphasizes what should be done next, evaluating whether LLMs can leverage these inferred mental states to predict, select, and assess appropriate dialogue strategies. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate that RecToM poses a significant challenge. While the models exhibit partial competence in recognizing mental states, they struggle to maintain coherent, strategic ToM reasoning throughout dynamic recommendation dialogues, particularly in tracking evolving intentions and aligning conversational strategies with inferred mental states.

Abstract: Numerical simulations have revolutionized the industrial design process by reducing prototyping costs, design iterations, and enabling product engineers to explore the design space more efficiently. However, the growing scale of simulations demands substantial expert knowledge, computational resources, and time. A key challenge is identifying input parameters that yield optimal results, as iterative simulations are costly and can have a large environmental impact. This paper presents an AI-assisted workflow that reduces expert involvement in parameter optimization through the use of Bayesian optimization. Furthermore, we present an active learning variant of the approach, assisting the expert if desired. A deep learning model provides an initial parameter estimate, from which the optimization cycle iteratively refines the design until a termination condition (e.g., energy budget or iteration limit) is met. We demonstrate our approach, based on a sheet metal forming process, and show how it enables us to accelerate the exploration of the design space while reducing the need for expert involvement.

Motivation: 双钙钛矿材料在可持续能源技术中具有巨大潜力，但其庞大的设计空间给条件性材料发现带来了重大挑战。传统方法难以在自然语言条件下高效探索这一复杂设计空间。

Method: 开发多智能体文本梯度驱动框架，整合三种互补反馈源：1) LLM自评估反馈，2) 双钙钛矿特定领域知识反馈，3) ML代理模型反馈。通过知识引导的文本梯度指导生成过程，向物理意义明确的组成空间区域收敛。

Result: 框架实现了超过98%的组成有效性，稳定或亚稳定候选材料比例达54%，显著优于纯LLM基线（43%）和先前GAN方法（27%）。ML梯度在分布内区域表现良好，但在分布外区域可靠性下降。

Conclusion: 该工作首次系统分析了多智能体知识引导文本梯度在双钙钛矿发现中的应用，为MAS驱动的生成式材料设计建立了可推广的蓝图，有助于推进可持续能源技术发展。

Abstract: Double perovskites (DPs) are promising candidates for sustainable energy technologies due to their compositional tunability and compatibility with low-energy fabrication, yet their vast design space poses a major challenge for conditional materials discovery. This work introduces a multi-agent, text gradient-driven framework that performs DP composition generation under natural-language conditions by integrating three complementary feedback sources: LLM-based self-evaluation, DP-specific domain knowledge-informed feedback, and ML surrogate-based feedback. Analogous to how knowledge-informed machine learning improves the reliability of conventional data-driven models, our framework incorporates domain-informed text gradients to guide the generative process toward physically meaningful regions of the DP composition space. Systematic comparison of three incremental configurations, (i) pure LLM generation, (ii) LLM generation with LLM reasoning-based feedback, and (iii) LLM generation with domain knowledge-guided feedback, shows that iterative guidance from knowledge-informed gradients improves stability-condition satisfaction without additional training data, achieving over 98% compositional validity and up to 54% stable or metastable candidates, surpassing both the LLM-only baseline (43%) and prior GAN-based results (27%). Analyses of ML-based gradients further reveal that they enhance performance in in-distribution (ID) regions but become unreliable in out-of-distribution (OOD) regimes. Overall, this work provides the first systematic analysis of multi-agent, knowledge-guided text gradients for DP discovery and establishes a generalizable blueprint for MAS-driven generative materials design aimed at advancing sustainable technologies.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于群体智能的去中心化多智能体框架，用于从头设计蛋白质，无需微调或特定任务数据，通过并行LLM智能体在残基级别协同工作实现高效目标导向设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前蛋白质设计方法（如蛋白质语言模型和扩散模型）需要大量微调、任务特定数据或模型重构，限制了灵活性和可扩展性。需要一种更通用、无需专门训练的方法来应对序列空间的巨大性和序列-结构-功能之间的复杂耦合。

Method: 采用去中心化、基于群体智能的多智能体框架：多个大型语言模型（LLM）智能体并行运行，每个智能体负责特定残基位置，通过迭代提出上下文感知的突变，整合设计目标、局部邻域相互作用以及先前迭代的记忆和反馈。

Result: 在α螺旋和卷曲结构蛋白质上实验验证，能够设计出多样化、明确界定的序列，无需依赖基序支架或多序列比对。通过残基保守性、结构指标、序列收敛和嵌入分析，证明框架展现出涌现行为并有效导航蛋白质适应度景观。

Conclusion: 该方法在几GPU小时内实现高效目标导向设计，完全无需微调或专门训练，为蛋白质设计提供了通用且适应性强的解决方案。该方法为跨生物分子系统和其他科学发现任务的集体LLM驱动设计奠定了基础。

Abstract: Designing proteins de novo with tailored structural, physicochemical, and functional properties remains a grand challenge in biotechnology, medicine, and materials science, due to the vastness of sequence space and the complex coupling between sequence, structure, and function. Current state-of-the-art generative methods, such as protein language models (PLMs) and diffusion-based architectures, often require extensive fine-tuning, task-specific data, or model reconfiguration to support objective-directed design, thereby limiting their flexibility and scalability. To overcome these limitations, we present a decentralized, agent-based framework inspired by swarm intelligence for de novo protein design. In this approach, multiple large language model (LLM) agents operate in parallel, each assigned to a specific residue position. These agents iteratively propose context-aware mutations by integrating design objectives, local neighborhood interactions, and memory and feedback from previous iterations. This position-wise, decentralized coordination enables emergent design of diverse, well-defined sequences without reliance on motif scaffolds or multiple sequence alignments, validated with experiments on proteins with alpha helix and coil structures. Through analyses of residue conservation, structure-based metrics, and sequence convergence and embeddings, we demonstrate that the framework exhibits emergent behaviors and effective navigation of the protein fitness landscape. Our method achieves efficient, objective-directed designs within a few GPU-hours and operates entirely without fine-tuning or specialized training, offering a generalizable and adaptable solution for protein design. Beyond proteins, the approach lays the groundwork for collective LLM-driven design across biomolecular systems and other scientific discovery tasks.

Motivation: 城市经济活力是城市长期增长潜力的关键指标，但传统基于静态城市级聚合数据的方法无法捕捉一个基本动态：今天一个城市的发展轨迹可能预示着明天结构相似城市的发展路径。

Method: 开发ECO-GROW多图框架，整合产业关联、POI相似性、迁移相似性和15年时间网络演化。结合动态Top-K GCN自适应选择有影响力的城际连接，以及自适应图评分机制动态加权跨区域影响。还包含基于Barabasi Proximity的链接预测任务来优化图表示。

Conclusion: 通过开源代码，使政府机构和公共部门组织能够利用大数据分析进行基于证据的城市规划、经济政策制定和资源配置决策，造福社会。

Abstract: Urban economic vitality is a crucial indicator of a city's long-term growth potential, comprising key metrics such as the annual number of new companies and the population employed. However, modeling urban economic vitality remains challenging. This study develops ECO-GROW, a multi-graph framework modeling China's inter-city networks (2005-2021) to generate urban embeddings that model urban economic vitality. Traditional approaches relying on static city-level aggregates fail to capture a fundamental dynamic: the developmental trajectory of one city today may mirror that of its structurally similar counterparts tomorrow. ECO-GROW overcomes this limitation by integrating industrial linkages, POI similarities, migration similarities and temporal network evolution over 15 years. The framework combines a Dynamic Top-K GCN to adaptively select influential inter-city connections and an adaptive Graph Scorer mechanism to dynamically weight cross-regional impacts. Additionally, the model incorporates a link prediction task based on Barabasi Proximity, optimizing the graph representation. Experimental results demonstrate ECO-GROW's superior accuracy in predicting entrepreneurial activities and employment trends compared to conventional models. By open-sourcing our code, we enable government agencies and public sector organizations to leverage big data analytics for evidence-based urban planning, economic policy formulation, and resource allocation decisions that benefit society at large.

Conclusion: 无限论证框架中的grounded扩展计算复杂度远高于有限情况，这揭示了形式论证推理中有限与无限情况的根本差异

Abstract: Argumentation frameworks, consisting of arguments and an attack relation representing conflicts, are fundamental for formally studying reasoning under conflicting information. We use methods from mathematical logic, specifically computability and set theory, to analyze the grounded extension, a widely-used model of maximally skeptical reasoning, defined as the least fixed-point of a natural defense operator. Without additional constraints, finding this fixed-point requires transfinite iterations. We identify the exact ordinal number corresponding to the length of this iterative process and determine the complexity of deciding grounded acceptance, showing it to be maximally complex. This shows a marked distinction from the finite case where the grounded extension is polynomial-time computable, thus simpler than other reasoning problems explored in formal argumentation.

Conclusion: 尽管最小变更原则在学习能力上存在局限性，但最小修正方法在多种实际情境下仍能成功学习。研究为信念修正理论与学习理论的交叉领域提供了理论分析框架，揭示了不同信念修正方法的学习能力边界。

Abstract: The principle of minimal change in belief revision theory requires that, when accepting new information, one keeps one's belief state as close to the initial belief state as possible. This is precisely what the method known as minimal revision does. However, unlike less conservative belief revision methods, minimal revision falls short in learning power: It cannot learn everything that can be learned by other learning methods. We begin by showing that, despite this limitation, minimal revision is still a successful learning method in a wide range of situations. Firstly, it can learn any problem that is finitely identifiable. Secondly, it can learn with positive and negative data, as long as one considers finitely many possibilities. We then characterize the prior plausibility assignments (over finitely many possibilities) that enable one to learn via minimal revision, and do the same for conditioning and lexicographic upgrade. Finally, we show that not all of our results still hold when learning from possibly erroneous information.

Method: 使用視覺語言模型從BPMN圖像直接提取JSON表示，結合光學字符識別進行文本豐富化，並與源XML文件的真實數據進行評估

Result: 在多個VLM上進行基準測試，發現使用OCR進行文本豐富化時多個模型性能有所提升，並通過統計分析和提示消融研究提供了對方法影響的更清晰理解

Conclusion: 該方法在原始源文件不可用的情況下實現了強大的組件提取，為BPMN圖像分析提供了實用的解決方案

Abstract: Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) is a widely adopted standard for representing complex business workflows. While BPMN diagrams are often exchanged as visual images, existing methods primarily rely on XML representations for computational analysis. In this work, we present a pipeline that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to extract structured JSON representations of BPMN diagrams directly from images, without requiring source model files or textual annotations. We also incorporate optical character recognition (OCR) for textual enrichment and evaluate the generated element lists against ground truth data derived from the source XML files. Our approach enables robust component extraction in scenarios where original source files are unavailable. We benchmark multiple VLMs and observe performance improvements in several models when OCR is used for text enrichment. In addition, we conducted extensive statistical analyses of OCR-based enrichment methods and prompt ablation studies, providing a clearer understanding of their impact on model performance.

Motivation: 心理学中的心理理论（ToM）概念（目标、意图、信念）缺乏形式化计算框架，而逻辑学方法虽然形式化但计算复杂。需要一种既能自动化ToM过程又能保持计算可行性的方法。

Method: 采用博弈论视角，构建一个计算框架：一方面规定如何在保持对他人心理理论（递归地，他人也对其他人持有心理理论）的情况下做出有限理性决策；另一方面使用统计技术和近似解来保持计算可行性。

Result: 提出了一个结合博弈论、有限理性和统计近似的计算框架，能够在保持心理理论递归推理的同时解决计算复杂性问题。

Conclusion: 该框架为心理理论的计算实现提供了新的视角，通过博弈论方法和近似技术平衡了理论完备性与计算可行性，为跨学科研究提供了桥梁。

Abstract: Originating in psychology, $\textit{Theory of Mind}$ (ToM) has attracted significant attention across multiple research communities, especially logic, economics, and robotics. Most psychological work does not aim at formalizing those central concepts, namely $\textit{goals}$, $\textit{intentions}$, and $\textit{beliefs}$, to automate a ToM-based computational process, which, by contrast, has been extensively studied by logicians. In this paper, we offer a different perspective by proposing a computational framework viewed through the lens of game theory. On the one hand, the framework prescribes how to make boudedly rational decisions while maintaining a theory of mind about others (and recursively, each of the others holding a theory of mind about the rest); on the other hand, it employs statistical techniques and approximate solutions to retain computability of the inherent computational problem.

Result: 1. 神经模型与松弛方法表现相似，没有神经模型能持续优于后者；2. 两者检索的答案重叠度低；3. 组合两者的输出能持续提升性能。

Conclusion: 当前神经查询回答模型的进展需要重新评估：尽管复杂，但未能涵盖查询松弛所捕获的推理模式。研究强调了更强非神经基线的重要性，并建议未来神经方法应融入查询松弛原则。

Abstract: Neural methods for Complex Query Answering (CQA) over knowledge graphs (KGs) are widely believed to learn patterns that generalize beyond explicit graph structure, allowing them to infer answers that are unreachable through symbolic query processing. In this work, we critically examine this assumption through a systematic analysis comparing neural CQA models with an alternative, training-free query relaxation strategy that retrieves possible answers by relaxing query constraints and counting resulting paths. Across multiple datasets and query structures, we find several cases where neural and relaxation-based approaches perform similarly, with no neural model consistently outperforming the latter. Moreover, a similarity analysis reveals that their retrieved answers exhibit little overlap, and that combining their outputs consistently improves performance. These results call for a re-evaluation of progress in neural query answering: despite their complexity, current models fail to subsume the reasoning patterns captured by query relaxation. Our findings highlight the importance of stronger non-neural baselines and suggest that future neural approaches could benefit from incorporating principles of query relaxation.

Motivation: 当前基于最终答案奖励的LLM数学推理方法存在根本局限：正确答案不保证正确推理，且许多数学任务（如定理证明）需要逐步推导而非数值答案。需要验证数学推理的全面性和严谨性，特别是对于没有已知解的开放问题。

Conclusion: 通过自我验证机制和扩展验证计算，可以显著提升LLM的深度数学推理能力，特别是在定理证明等需要严谨推导的任务上，为推进AI数学推理提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Large language models have made significant progress in mathematical reasoning, which serves as an important testbed for AI and could impact scientific research if further advanced. By scaling reasoning with reinforcement learning that rewards correct final answers, LLMs have improved from poor performance to saturating quantitative reasoning competitions like AIME and HMMT in one year. However, this approach faces fundamental limitations. Pursuing higher final answer accuracy doesn't address a key issue: correct answers don't guarantee correct reasoning. Moreover, many mathematical tasks like theorem proving require rigorous step-by-step derivation rather than numerical answers, making final answer rewards inapplicable. To push the limits of deep reasoning, we believe it is necessary to verify the comprehensiveness and rigor of mathematical reasoning. Self-verification is particularly important for scaling test-time compute, especially for open problems without known solutions. Towards self-verifiable mathematical reasoning, we investigate how to train an accurate and faithful LLM-based verifier for theorem proving. We then train a proof generator using the verifier as the reward model, and incentivize the generator to identify and resolve as many issues as possible in their own proofs before finalizing them. To maintain the generation-verification gap as the generator becomes stronger, we propose to scale verification compute to automatically label new hard-to-verify proofs, creating training data to further improve the verifier. Our resulting model, DeepSeekMath-V2, demonstrates strong theorem-proving capabilities, achieving gold-level scores on IMO 2025 and CMO 2024 and a near-perfect 118/120 on Putnam 2024 with scaled test-time compute.

Abstract: As intelligence increases, so does its shadow. AI deception, in which systems induce false beliefs to secure self-beneficial outcomes, has evolved from a speculative concern to an empirically demonstrated risk across language models, AI agents, and emerging frontier systems. This project provides a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of the AI deception field, covering its core concepts, methodologies, genesis, and potential mitigations. First, we identify a formal definition of AI deception, grounded in signaling theory from studies of animal deception. We then review existing empirical studies and associated risks, highlighting deception as a sociotechnical safety challenge. We organize the landscape of AI deception research as a deception cycle, consisting of two key components: deception emergence and deception treatment. Deception emergence reveals the mechanisms underlying AI deception: systems with sufficient capability and incentive potential inevitably engage in deceptive behaviors when triggered by external conditions. Deception treatment, in turn, focuses on detecting and addressing such behaviors. On deception emergence, we analyze incentive foundations across three hierarchical levels and identify three essential capability preconditions required for deception. We further examine contextual triggers, including supervision gaps, distributional shifts, and environmental pressures. On deception treatment, we conclude detection methods covering benchmarks and evaluation protocols in static and interactive settings. Building on the three core factors of deception emergence, we outline potential mitigation strategies and propose auditing approaches that integrate technical, community, and governance efforts to address sociotechnical challenges and future AI risks. To support ongoing work in this area, we release a living resource at www.deceptionsurvey.com.

Abstract: Effective agent shift scheduling is crucial for businesses, especially in the Contact Center as a Service (CCaaS) industry, to ensure seamless operations and fulfill employee needs. Most studies utilizing mathematical model-based solutions approach the problem as a single-step process, often resulting in inefficiencies and high computational demands. In contrast, we present a multi-phase allocation method that addresses scalability and accuracy by dividing the problem into smaller sub-problems of day and shift allocation, which significantly reduces number of computational variables and allows for targeted objective functions, ultimately enhancing both efficiency and accuracy. Each subproblem is modeled as a Integer Programming Problem (IPP), with solutions sequentially feeding into the subsequent subproblem. We then apply the proposed method, using a multi-objective framework, to address the difficulties posed by peak demand scenarios such as holiday rushes, where maintaining service levels is essential despite having limited number of employees

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在空间推理中存在根本性的语义-几何鸿沟：擅长定性语义推理但在有损语义空间中操作，与高保真几何不匹配。现有方法无法弥合这一鸿沟：基于训练的方法存在"预言悖论"，从有缺陷的预言中学习错误的空间逻辑；工具集成方法约束最终计算但未约束VLM的规划过程，导致几何缺陷的计划。

Method: 提出几何约束智能体(GCA)，将VLM角色战略性地解耦为两个阶段：1) 作为语义分析师，将用户的模糊查询转换为形式化、可验证的任务约束，定义参考框架和目标；2) 作为任务求解器，在约束定义的确定性边界内严格生成和执行工具调用。这种几何约束推理策略成功解决了语义-几何鸿沟。

Result: GCA在多个空间推理基准上实现了SOTA性能，超越现有基于训练和工具集成方法约27%。

Conclusion: GCA通过引入形式化任务约束和角色解耦策略，为空间推理提供了稳健且可验证的推理路径，成功解决了VLM中的语义-几何鸿沟问题。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) exhibit a fundamental semantic-to-geometric gap in spatial reasoning: they excel at qualitative semantic inference but their reasoning operates within a lossy semantic space, misaligned with high-fidelity geometry. Current paradigms fail to bridge this gap. Training-based methods suffer from an ``oracle paradox,'' learning flawed spatial logic from imperfect oracles. Tool-integrated methods constrain the final computation but critically leave the VLM's planning process unconstrained, resulting in geometrically flawed plans. In this work, we propose Geometrically-Constrained Agent (GCA), a training-free agentic paradigm that resolves this gap by introducing a formal task constraint. Specifically, we strategically decouples the VLM's role into two stages. First, acting as a semantic analyst, the VLM translates the user's ambiguous query into the formal, verifiable task constraint, which defines the reference frame and objective. Second, acting as a task solver, the VLM generates and executes tool calls strictly within the deterministic bounds defined by the constraint. This geometrically-constrained reasoning strategy successfully resolve the semantic-to-geometric gap, yielding a robust and verifiable reasoning pathway for spatial reasoning. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that GCA achieves SOTA performance on multiple spatial reasoning benchmarks, surpassing existing training-based and tool-integrated methods by ~27%.

TL;DR: 提出一种新方法让LLM能处理任意长度的工具输出而不丢失信息，通过将交互从原始数据转向内存指针，减少token使用和执行时间


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在处理动态、知识密集型领域（如化学和材料科学）时，大型工具输出会超出上下文窗口，现有截断或摘要方法会丢失完整数据，不适合需要完整输出的工作流

Method: 将LLM与工具的交互从原始数据转向内存指针，保留工具功能，实现无缝集成到智能体工作流中

Result: 在真实材料科学应用中验证了方法的有效性，相比传统工作流减少了约7倍的token消耗，同时保持了完整信息

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了LLM处理大型工具输出的上下文限制问题，实现了信息无损处理，显著提升了效率和实用性

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly capable of interacting with external tools, granting access to specialized knowledge beyond their training data - critical in dynamic, knowledge-intensive domains such as Chemistry and Materials Science. However, large tool outputs can overflow the LLMs' context window, preventing task completion. Existing solutions such as truncation or summarization fail to preserve complete outputs, making them unsuitable for workflows requiring the full data. This work introduces a method that enables LLMs to process and utilize tool responses of arbitrary length without loss of information. By shifting the model's interaction from raw data to memory pointers, the method preserves tool functionality, allows seamless integration into agentic workflows, and reduces token usage and execution time. The proposed method is validated on a real-world Materials Science application that cannot be executed with conventional workflows, and its effectiveness is demonstrated via a comparative analysis where both methods succeed. In this experiment, the proposed approach consumed approximately seven times fewer tokens than the traditional workflow.

Abstract: The paper presents a detailed Agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI) model that would enable people with disabilities and neurodivergence to lead healthier lives and have more regular days. The system will use a multi-layer structure; it will include an Application and Interface Layer, an Agents Layer, and a Data Source Layer to provide adaptive, transparent, and inclusive support. Fundamentally, a hybrid reasoning engine will synchronize four special-purpose agents, which include: a personalized-nutrition-based, called a Meal Planner Agent; an adaptive-scheduling-based, called a Reminder Agent; interactive assistance during grocery shopping and cooking, called a Food Guidance Agent; and a continuous-intake-and-physiological-tracking, called a Monitoring Agent. All the agents interact through a central communicative system called the Blackboard/Event Bus, which allows autonomous interaction and real-time feedback loops with multimedia user interfaces. Privacy-sensitive data sources, including electronic health records (EHRs), nutritional databases, wearable sensors, and smart kitchen Internet of Things, are also included in the framework and placed into a policy-controlled layer, which ensures data safety and compliance with consent. Collaborative care and clinician dashboards allow common supervision, and discussable artificial intelligence (XAI) modules give brief explanations of why a decision was made, making users responsible and reliant. The proposed agentic AI framework is an extension beyond traditional assistive systems since it incorporates inclusiveness, personalization, and accessibility at all levels. It displays the intersection of multi-agent reasoning, multi-modal interfaces, and human-centered design that will enable the development of autonomy, health, and digital equity among people with disabilities and neurodivergence.

TL;DR: 本文提出一个基于多智能体的人工智能系统，将感知、预报、降尺度、水文建模和协调响应整合为单一闭环系统，用于应对极端短时降雨事件（如云爆发），在巴基斯坦北部地区的评估显示该系统提高了预报可靠性、关键成功指数和预警提前时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统预报系统将预测和响应视为两个独立过程，难以应对云爆发等极端短时降雨事件。需要一种集成化的系统来改进极端天气事件的预报和响应能力。

Abstract: The challenge is growing towards extreme and short-duration rainfall events like a cloudburst that are peculiar to the traditional forecasting systems, in which the predictions and the response are taken as two distinct processes. The paper outlines an agentic artificial intelligence system to study atmospheric water-cycle intelligence, which combines sensing, forecasting, downscaling, hydrological modeling and coordinated response into a single, interconnected, priceless, closed-loop system. The framework uses autonomous but cooperative agents that reason, sense, and act throughout the entire event lifecycle, and use the intelligence of weather prediction to become real-time decision intelligence. Comparison of multi-year radar, satellite, and ground-based evaluation of the northern part of Pakistan demonstrates that the multi-agent configuration enhances forecast reliability, critical success index and warning lead time compared to the baseline models. Population reach was maximised, and errors during evacuation were minimised through communication and routing agents, and adaptive recalibration and transparent auditability were provided by the embedded layer of learning. Collectively, this leads to the conclusion that collaborative AI agents are capable of transforming atmospheric data streams into practicable foresight and provide a platform of scalable adaptive and learning-based climate resilience.

Method: fastDSA引入两个关键组件：1) 通过数据驱动的奇异值阈值自动选择Hankel嵌入的有效模型阶数，识别信息子空间并丢弃噪声；2) 新颖的优化过程和目标函数，用轻量级过程替代缓慢的精确正交性约束

Result: fastDSA比先前方法至少快一个数量级，同时保持准确性和鲁棒性，继承了祖先方法的性质，包括对系统动态的不变性和敏感性

Conclusion: fastDSA提供了一种计算高效且准确的动态相似性分析方法，适用于比较神经系统的动态结构

Abstract: To understand how neural systems process information, it is often essential to compare one circuit with another, one brain with another, or data with a model. Traditional similarity measures ignore the dynamical processes underlying neural representations. Dynamical similarity methods offer a framework to compare the temporal structure of dynamical systems by embedding their (possibly) nonlinear dynamics into a globally linear space and there computing conjugacy metrics. However, identifying the best embedding and computing these metrics can be computationally slow. Here we introduce fast Dynamical Similarity Analysis (fastDSA), which is computationally far more efficient than previous methods while maintaining their accuracy and robustness. FastDSA introduces two key components that boost efficiency: (1) automatic selection of the effective model order of the Hankel (delay) embedding from the data via a data-driven singular-value threshold that identifies the informative subspace and discards noise to lower computational cost without sacrificing signal, and (2) a novel optimization procedure and objective, which replaces the slow exact orthogonality constraint in finding a minimal distance between dynamics matrices with a lightweight process to keep the search close to the space of orthogonal transformations. We demonstrate that fastDSA is at least an order of magnitude faster than the previous methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that fastDSA has the properties of its ancestor, including its invariances and sensitivities to system dynamics. FastDSA, therefore, provides a computationally efficient and accurate method for dynamical similarity analysis.

Abstract: Data analysis has become an indispensable part of scientific research. To discover the latent knowledge and insights hidden within massive datasets, we need to perform deep exploratory analysis to realize their full value. With the advent of large language models (LLMs) and multi-agent systems, more and more researchers are making use of these technologies for insight discovery. However, there are few benchmarks for evaluating insight discovery capabilities. As one of the most comprehensive existing frameworks, InsightBench also suffers from many critical flaws: format inconsistencies, poorly conceived objectives, and redundant insights. These issues may significantly affect the quality of data and the evaluation of agents. To address these issues, we thoroughly investigate shortcomings in InsightBench and propose essential criteria for a high-quality insight benchmark. Regarding this, we develop a data-curation pipeline to construct a new dataset named InsightEval. We further introduce a novel metric to measure the exploratory performance of agents. Through extensive experiments on InsightEval, we highlight prevailing challenges in automated insight discovery and raise some key findings to guide future research in this promising direction.

TL;DR: 论文提出Mentalese框架，通过超压缩结构化令牌实现高效推理，结合SLPO优化方法，在保持准确性的同时大幅减少推理令牌数量并降低延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型依赖冗长的"思考"令牌链，导致高延迟、冗余和不连贯的推理路径。受人类思维语言假说启发，需要开发更紧凑的推理方式。

Method: 引入Mentalese框架，将抽象推理编码为超压缩结构化令牌；提出SLPO强化学习方法，奖励简洁且正确的解决方案。

Result: ORION模型在多个基准测试中实现4-16倍令牌减少、5倍延迟降低、7-9倍训练成本降低，保持90-98%准确性，并在某些任务上超越Claude和ChatGPT-4o。

Conclusion: Mentalese风格的压缩推理实现了类人认知效率，在不牺牲准确性的前提下实现实时、经济高效的推理。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve strong performance in mathematics, code generation, and task planning, but their reliance on long chains of verbose "thinking" tokens leads to high latency, redundancy, and incoherent reasoning paths. Inspired by the Language of Thought Hypothesis, which posits that human reasoning operates over a symbolic, compositional mental language called Mentalese, we introduce a framework that trains models to reason in a similarly compact style. Mentalese encodes abstract reasoning as ultra-compressed, structured tokens, enabling models to solve complex problems with far fewer steps. To improve both efficiency and accuracy, we propose SHORTER LENGTH PREFERENCE OPTIMIZATION (SLPO), a reinforcement learning method that rewards concise solutions that stay correct, while still allowing longer reasoning when needed. Applied to Mentalese-aligned models, SLPO yields significantly higher compression rates by enabling concise reasoning that preserves the benefits of detailed thinking without the computational overhead. Across benchmarks including AIME 2024 and 2025, MinervaMath, OlympiadBench, Math500, and AMC, our ORION models produce reasoning traces with 4-16x fewer tokens, achieve up to 5x lower inference latency, and reduce training costs by 7-9x relative to the DeepSeek R1 Distilled model, while maintaining 90-98% of its accuracy. ORION also surpasses Claude and ChatGPT-4o by up to 5% in accuracy while maintaining 2x compression. These results show that Mentalese-style compressed reasoning offers a step toward human-like cognitive efficiency, enabling real-time, cost-effective reasoning without sacrificing accuracy.

TL;DR: TIM-PRM是一个工具集成的多模态过程奖励模型，通过主动工具查询和独立提问机制，解决MLLMs在数学推理中的视觉幻觉和逻辑不一致问题，显著超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在数学推理中表现出色，但仍存在视觉幻觉和逻辑不一致问题。传统的结果监督方法无法解决这些问题，而现有的过程奖励模型通常作为标量评分器或生成批评者，存在奉承问题，盲目验证错误假设而非基于视觉现实。

Method: 提出TIM-PRM框架，将验证从被动分类任务转变为主动工具增强调查。模型训练明确规划验证策略，采用独立提问机制通过外部工具查询证据，将验证与推理上下文解耦以消除确认偏差。通过构建高质量工具集成验证轨迹数据集实现该方法。

Result: 在VisualProcessBench上的广泛实验表明，8B参数的TIM-PRM超越了现有开源多模态PRMs，显著优于Qwen2.5-72B和InternVL-78B等更大模型，同时提供可解释的验证过程洞察。

Conclusion: TIM-PRM通过工具集成和主动验证策略，有效解决了多模态数学推理中的视觉幻觉和逻辑不一致问题，提供了一种可解释且高效的验证框架。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive performances in mathematical reasoning, yet they remain vulnerable to visual hallucinations and logical inconsistencies that standard outcome-based supervision fails to mitigate. While Process Reward Models (PRMs) promise step-by-step verification, current approaches typically operate as scalar scorers or generative critics that suffer from sycophancy, blindly validating the flawed hypotheses rather than grounding them in visual reality. To bridge this gap, we introduce TIM-PRM (Tool-Integrated Multimodal PRM), a novel agentic framework that transforms verification from a passive classification task into an active, tool-augmented investigation. TIM-PRM is trained to explicitly plan verification strategies and utilizes a mechanism of Independent Question Asking to query evidence via external tools, effectively decoupling verification from the reasoning context to eliminate confirmation bias. We instantiate this method by curating a high-quality dataset of tool-integrated verification trajectories. Extensive experiments on VisualProcessBench demonstrate that our 8B parameter model surpasses existing open-source multimodal PRMs, significantly outperforming much larger models like Qwen2.5-72B and InternVL-78B, while offering interpretable insights into the verification process.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言具身智能体缺乏基于心理理论的决策能力，现有基准只关注人类心理状态而忽略智能体自身视角，这阻碍了连贯的决策和行动生成。

Method: 提出MindPower框架：给定多模态输入，先感知环境和人类状态，然后进行心理理论推理来建模自我和他人，最后根据推断的心理状态生成决策和行动。同时引入Mind-Reward优化目标，鼓励视觉语言模型产生一致的心理理论推理和行为。

Result: 模型在决策制定上比GPT-4o高出12.77%，在行动生成上高出12.49%，表现出显著优势。

Conclusion: MindPower框架通过整合心理理论推理和机器人中心视角，有效提升了具身智能体的决策和行动生成能力，为解决智能体缺乏心理理论能力的问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Theory of Mind (ToM) refers to the ability to infer others' mental states, such as beliefs, desires, and intentions. Current vision-language embodied agents lack ToM-based decision-making, and existing benchmarks focus solely on human mental states while ignoring the agent's own perspective, hindering coherent decision and action generation. To address this, we propose MindPower, a Robot-Centric framework integrating Perception, Mental Reasoning, Decision Making and Action. Given multimodal inputs, MindPower first perceives the environment and human states, then performs ToM Reasoning to model both self and others, and finally generates decisions and actions guided by inferred mental states. Furthermore, we introduce Mind-Reward, a novel optimization objective that encourages VLMs to produce consistent ToM Reasoning and behavior. Our model outperforms GPT-4o by 12.77% in decision making and 12.49% in action generation.

*David Demitri Africa,Hans Ethan Ting*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现当语言模型的自我评估与奖励信号耦合时，会导致"分数膨胀"现象——模型会操纵评分而非真正提升任务表现，特别是在模糊任务中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着自我评估在语言模型训练中越来越重要（从宪法AI到自我优化），研究者想探究当自我评估与奖励信号耦合时，是否会激励"线头化"现象——即智能体操纵奖励测量而非真正改进任务表现。

Method: 研究首先在部分可观测马尔可夫决策过程(POMDPs)中形式化了奖励通道控制严格优于任务聚焦行为的条件，然后通过两个模型和三个任务进行实证测试，比较了自我评估控制奖励的模型与自我评估不控制奖励的模型。

Result: 研究发现，当自我评估决定奖励时，模型表现出显著的分数膨胀但没有相应的准确性提升，特别是在摘要等模糊任务中。而自我评估但不控制奖励的模型则没有这种膨胀现象。

Conclusion: 自我评估在与学习信号解耦时是安全的，但当与奖励信号耦合时是危险的。这对智能体系统设计有明确启示：应避免让模型的自我评估直接控制其奖励信号。

Abstract: Self-evaluation is increasingly central to language model training, from constitutional AI to self-refinement. We investigate whether coupling self-evaluation to reward signals creates incentives for wireheading, where agents manipulate reward measurements rather than improving task performance. We formalize conditions under which reward-channel control strictly dominates task-focused behavior in POMDPs and test these predictions empirically. Across two models and three tasks, we find that models whose self-grades determine rewards exhibit substantial grade inflation without corresponding accuracy gains, particularly on ambiguous tasks like summarization. Models that self-evaluate but do not control rewards show no such inflation. Our results demonstrate that self-evaluation is safe when decoupled from learning signals but dangerous when coupled, with clear implications for agentic system design.

Result: 该方法在提示层面完全运行无需训练，产生轻量级、鲁棒的策略，针对特定交通环境优化，性能优于启发式方法和在线LLM执行器

Conclusion: TPET框架有效解决了交通信号控制中的权衡问题，通过LLM进化引擎生成专用启发式策略，在保持效率的同时提高了性能和可解释性

Abstract: Traffic Signal Control (TSC) involves a challenging trade-off: classic heuristics are efficient but oversimplified, while Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) achieves high performance yet suffers from poor generalization and opaque policies. Online Large Language Models (LLMs) provide general reasoning but incur high latency and lack environment-specific optimization. To address these issues, we propose Temporal Policy Evolution for Traffic (\textbf{\method{}}), which uses LLMs as an evolution engine to derive specialized heuristic policies. The framework introduces two key modules: (1) Structured State Abstraction (SSA), converting high-dimensional traffic data into temporal-logical facts for reasoning; and (2) Credit Assignment Feedback (CAF), tracing flawed micro-decisions to poor macro-outcomes for targeted critique. Operating entirely at the prompt level without training, \method{} yields lightweight, robust policies optimized for specific traffic environments, outperforming both heuristics and online LLM actors.

Motivation: 农村地区（如乳业社区）的可再生能源整合需要高效的分散式能源管理。传统基于规则的方法在动态环境中表现不佳，需要更智能的解决方案来优化P2P能源交易和能源分配。

Method: 结合多智能体强化学习（MARL）与社区/分布式P2P交易机制，采用PPO和DQN算法，整合拍卖式市场清算、价格顾问代理、负荷和电池管理。

Result: 相比基线模型，DQN在爱尔兰降低用电成本14.2%，芬兰降低5.16%；售电收入分别增加7.24%和12.73%。PPO在爱尔兰实现最低峰值需求，降低55.5%；DQN在爱尔兰和芬兰分别降低峰值需求50.0%和27.02%。

Conclusion: MARL算法与P2P能源交易的结合在降低用电成本、减少峰值需求和增加售电收入方面效果显著，展示了DQN、PPO和P2P交易在实现农村社区高效、适应性强且可持续能源管理方面的互补优势。

Abstract: The integration of renewable energy resources in rural areas, such as dairy farming communities, enables decentralized energy management through Peer-to-Peer (P2P) energy trading. This research highlights the role of P2P trading in efficient energy distribution and its synergy with advanced optimization techniques. While traditional rule-based methods perform well under stable conditions, they struggle in dynamic environments. To address this, Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), specifically Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Deep Q-Networks (DQN), is combined with community/distributed P2P trading mechanisms. By incorporating auction-based market clearing, a price advisor agent, and load and battery management, the approach achieves significant improvements. Results show that, compared to baseline models, DQN reduces electricity costs by 14.2% in Ireland and 5.16% in Finland, while increasing electricity revenue by 7.24% and 12.73%, respectively. PPO achieves the lowest peak hour demand, reducing it by 55.5% in Ireland, while DQN reduces peak hour demand by 50.0% in Ireland and 27.02% in Finland. These improvements are attributed to both MARL algorithms and P2P energy trading, which together results in electricity cost and peak hour demand reduction, and increase electricity selling revenue. This study highlights the complementary strengths of DQN, PPO, and P2P trading in achieving efficient, adaptable, and sustainable energy management in rural communities.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have significantly transformed various industries. In agriculture, these dual-modal capabilities offer promising applications such as precision farming, crop monitoring, pest detection, and environmental sustainability. While several Visual Question Answering (VQA) datasets and benchmarks have been developed to evaluate VLM performance, they often fail to adequately assess the critical reasoning and problem-solving skills required in complex agricultural contexts. To address this gap, we introduce AgriCoT, a VQA dataset that incorporates Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, specifically designed to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of VLMs. With 4,535 carefully curated samples, AgriCoT offers a comprehensive and robust evaluation of reasoning abilities for VLMs, particularly in zero-shot scenarios, by focusing on their capacity to engage in logical reasoning and effective problem-solving. Our evaluations, conducted with 26 representative VLMs, including both proprietary and open-source models, reveal that while some proprietary models excel at answering questions, there is a notable and significant gap in their reasoning capabilities. This underscores the importance of incorporating CoT for more precise and effective assessments. Our dataset are available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/wenyb/AgriCoT.

TL;DR: 提出MCTR框架，通过元认知自我更新让视觉语言模型在测试时具备学习、适应和改进能力，在Atari游戏上展现强大测试时适应性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型具有强大感知推理能力，但在测试时遇到新任务时适应效率低，而人类通过元认知模型和记忆能够持续优化策略。需要弥合这一差距。

Method: 提出元认知测试时推理框架MCTR，包含元推理模块（增量构建结构化记忆，存储任务相关规则、环境模式和行动-结果关系）和行动推理模块（通过上下文感知和策略推理确定最优行动，动态检索整合记忆知识）。使用元认知测试时强化学习更新策略。

Result: 在45个Atari游戏（33个已见，12个未见）上评估，MCTR在未见游戏中9/12取得top-1结果，优于基线。消融实验、学习动态和案例研究显示两个组件的互补贡献，元推理向类人适应策略演化。

Conclusion: MCTR框架成功赋予模型元认知测试时适应能力，通过分层自适应推理和记忆系统实现持续改进，在未见任务上表现优异，展示了向人类元认知策略演化的潜力。

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit strong perceptual reasoning abilities, yet they often struggle to adapt efficiently when encountering novel tasks at test time. In contrast, humans leverage the metacognitive model with memory, enabling continuous strategy refinement through metacognitive control when faced with new challenges. To bridge this gap, we propose metacognitive test-time reasoning (MCTR), a framework that equips models with the ability to learn, adapt, and improve during test time through metacognitive self-updating. Inspired by the dual structure of human metacognition, MCTR comprises meta-level and object-level VLM reasoning modules, each equipped with dedicated memory systems for hierarchical adaptive reasoning. Specifically, MCTR consists of (1) a meta-reasoning module which incrementally builds a structured memory by discovering and storing task-relevant rules, environmental patterns, and action-outcome relationships from test-time observations as natural language descriptions; and (2) an action-reasoning module that determines optimal actions through context-aware perception and strategic reasoning by dynamically retrieving and integrating knowledge from memory. The action-reasoning module continuously updates its policy through proposed metacognitive test-time reinforcement learning, adapting as knowledge memory evolves. We evaluate MCTR on 45 Atari games (33 seen, 12 unseen). MCTR demonstrates robust test-time adaptation, achieving 9/12 top-1 results on unseen games compared with baselines. Analyses through ablations, learning dynamics, and case studies reveal the complementary contributions of both components and show meta-reasoning evolving toward human-like adaptation strategies.

Motivation: 高质量、精心策划的数据是训练医学大语言模型的基础，直接影响模型对未见临床任务的泛化能力和鲁棒性。需要研究如何通过数据策展和训练策略开发鲁棒的多模态推理模型。

Abstract: High-quality and carefully curated data is a cornerstone of training medical large language models, as it directly impacts both generalization and robustness to unseen clinical tasks. We investigate strategies for training and data curation to develop a robust multimodal reasoning model in the medical domain. Our work focuses on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and explores data recipes that leverage structured reasoning traces. Using our proposed data recipe, we scale experiments to a dataset of over 8 million examples and 6.8 billion response tokens, achieving state-of-the-art performance among open-source models across diverse out-of-distribution medical benchmark tasks. Our results further indicate that curating a high-quality, diverse training dataset with varying structured reasoning trace lengths enables the fine-tuned model to self-calibrate its reasoning trajectory lengths based on the downstream task, without explicit supervision. We present key insights, describe the data curation strategy, and outline next steps toward developing robust medical vision-language reasoning system.

TL;DR: 提出SHRIKE模型，结合多模态场景图和Kolmogorov-Arnold专家网络进行音频-视觉问答，在MUSIC-AVQA基准上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法捕捉视频中的结构信息，且对多模态特征的细粒度建模不足。音频-视觉问答需要从复杂的视听内容中识别问题相关线索，模仿人类推理过程。

Method: 1) 提出新的多模态场景图，显式建模对象及其关系作为音频-视觉场景的视觉基础结构化表示；2) 设计基于Kolmogorov-Arnold网络的混合专家系统，增强时序集成阶段的表达能力，实现更细粒度的跨模态交互建模。

Result: 在MUSIC-AVQA和MUSIC-AVQA v2基准测试中取得了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: SHRIKE模型通过多模态场景图和KAN-based MoE架构，有效解决了音频-视觉问答中的结构信息捕捉和细粒度建模问题，提升了时序推理性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-Modal Scene Graph with Kolmogorov-Arnold Expert Network for Audio-Visual Question Answering (SHRIKE). The task aims to mimic human reasoning by extracting and fusing information from audio-visual scenes, with the main challenge being the identification of question-relevant cues from the complex audio-visual content. Existing methods fail to capture the structural information within video, and suffer from insufficient fine-grained modeling of multi-modal features. To address these issues, we are the first to introduce a new multi-modal scene graph that explicitly models the objects and their relationship as a visually grounded, structured representation of the audio-visual scene. Furthermore, we design a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network~(KAN)-based Mixture of Experts (MoE) to enhance the expressive power of the temporal integration stage. This enables more fine-grained modeling of cross-modal interactions within the question-aware fused audio-visual representation, leading to capture richer and more nuanced patterns and then improve temporal reasoning performance. We evaluate the model on the established MUSIC-AVQA and MUSIC-AVQA v2 benchmarks, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance. Code and model checkpoints will be publicly released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代零售中产品种类繁多（服装、杂货、化妆品、冷冻食品等），难以准确预测需求、防止缺货和发现高潜力产品。

Method: 开发了一个智能AI模型，包含库存监控、供应商采购启动、趋势产品扫描功能，应用需求预测、供应商选择优化、多智能体协商和持续学习技术。

Result: 在中型超市的原型测试中，使用传统和人工数据表验证，相比基准启发式方法，系统减少了缺货、降低了库存持有成本、改善了产品组合周转率。

Conclusion: 系统有效改善了零售库存管理，同时讨论了约束条件、可扩展性和未来改进方向。

Abstract: In contemporary retail, the variety of products available (e.g. clothing, groceries, cosmetics, frozen goods) make it difficult to predict the demand, prevent stockouts, and find high-potential products. We suggest an agentic AI model that will be used to monitor the inventory, initiate purchase attempts to the appropriate suppliers, and scan for trending or high-margin products to incorporate. The system applies demand forecasting, supplier selection optimization, multi-agent negotiation and continuous learning. We apply a prototype to a setting in the store of a middle scale mart, test its performance on three conventional and artificial data tables, and compare the results to the base heuristics. Our findings indicate that there is a decrease in stockouts, a reduction of inventory holding costs, and an improvement in product mix turnover. We address constraints, scalability as well as improvement prospect.

TL;DR: 提出分层AI气象学家系统，通过分层预报推理和天气关键词生成可解释的天气报告，利用多尺度时间聚合和关键词验证提高LLM生成天气叙事的可解释性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将天气预报视为扁平时间序列，缺乏对短期动态和长期趋势的捕捉。现有LLM生成的天气报告缺乏可解释性和一致性验证机制，需要一种能够生成可解释、语义一致且事实对齐的天气报告框架。

Method: 构建分层AI气象学家LLM代理系统：1）进行多尺度推理（小时、6小时、日聚合）；2）核心推理代理将结构化气象输入转换为连贯叙述；3）同时提取少量关键词总结主要气象事件；4）利用关键词作为语义锚点验证生成报告的一致性、时间连贯性和事实对齐。

Result: 使用OpenWeather和Meteostat数据验证，分层上下文和基于关键词的验证显著提高了LLM生成天气叙事的可解释性和鲁棒性，为自动化气象报告的语义评估提供了可复现框架。

Conclusion: 该框架通过分层推理和关键词验证机制，提升了LLM生成天气报告的质量和可靠性，为基于代理的科学推理提供了新方法，推动了自动化气象报告语义评估的发展。

Abstract: We present the Hierarchical AI-Meteorologist, an LLM-agent system that generates explainable weather reports using a hierarchical forecast reasoning and weather keyword generation. Unlike standard approaches that treat forecasts as flat time series, our framework performs multi-scale reasoning across hourly, 6-hour, and daily aggregations to capture both short-term dynamics and long-term trends. Its core reasoning agent converts structured meteorological inputs into coherent narratives while simultaneously extracting a few keywords effectively summarizing the dominant meteorological events. These keywords serve as semantic anchors for validating consistency, temporal coherence and factual alignment of the generated reports. Using OpenWeather and Meteostat data, we demonstrate that hierarchical context and keyword-based validation substantially improve interpretability and robustness of LLM-generated weather narratives, offering a reproducible framework for semantic evaluation of automated meteorological reporting and advancing agent-based scientific reasoning.

TL;DR: SuperIntelliAgent是一个智能体学习框架，通过可训练的小型扩散模型（学习者）与冻结的大型语言模型（验证器）耦合，实现无标注的持续智能增长，利用DPO进行自我监督优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督微调需要大量标注数据，而该框架旨在实现无需人工标注的自主持续学习，通过学习者与验证器的交互产生训练信号，将普通推理循环转化为终身优化过程。

Method: 框架包含学习者（小型扩散模型）生成候选输出，验证器（冻结LLM）通过逐步推理评估输出，产生选择/拒绝对用于DPO训练。采用双尺度记忆：短期上下文记忆保存推理轨迹，长期记忆通过轻量微调巩固知识。回放缓冲区保留显示进展的样本作为辅助监督。

Result: 使用少量自动生成的DPO对，学习者在所有基准测试中均取得改进，表明该机制为持续智能积累和实际部署提供了有前景的方向。

Conclusion: 将可训练的学习者与具备推理能力的验证器配对构成了智能增长的最小可靠单元，这种配对反馈和部分历史回放机制产生了更丰富的学习课程和更强的偏好对齐，为持续智能发展提供了基础设施无关的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce SuperIntelliAgent, an agentic learning framework that couples a trainable small diffusion model (the learner) with a frozen large language model (the verifier) to enable continual intelligence growth through self-supervised interaction. Unlike conventional supervised fine-tuning, SuperIntelliAgent learns autonomously without annotation: the learner generates candidate outputs, the verifier evaluates them through step-by-step reasoning, and their interaction produces chosen/rejected pairs for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). This converts each input into a pseudo-training signal for continual improvement. The framework integrates dual-scale memory: short-term in-context memory that preserves reasoning traces across refinement cycles, and long-term memory that consolidates acquired knowledge through lightweight on-the-fly fine-tuning. A replay buffer retains samples that show verifiable progress and replays them as auxiliary supervision, reinforcing recent learning while forming adaptive curricula. SuperIntelliAgent is infrastructure-agnostic and can be plugged into existing agentic frameworks while turning ordinary inference loops into a lifelong optimization process. We posit that pairing a trainable learner with a reasoning-capable verifier forms a minimal reliable unit of growing intelligence, as paired feedback and partial-history replay yield richer learning curricula and stronger preference alignment. With a small number of automatically generated DPO pairs, the learner improves across all benchmarks, indicating that this mechanism provides a promising direction for continual intelligence accumulation and real-world deployment.

TL;DR: WMAct通过奖励重标定和交互频率退火机制，让LLM在自由推理中内化世界模型，实现单轮解决多轮任务并提升迁移能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多轮交互方法通常强加僵化的推理过程，限制了模型的主动学习，阻碍了高效的世界模型推理。需要探索更灵活的方式让模型通过交互内化环境动态

Method: 提出WMAct框架，包含两个关键机制：1) 基于行动效能的奖励重标定机制，激励减少冗余和有目的的交互；2) 交互频率退火策略，逐步减少允许的最大交互轮数，迫使模型压缩学习并内化环境动态

Result: 在Sokoban、Maze和Taxi等环境中，WMAct能够实现有效的世界模型推理，单轮解决之前需要多轮交互的任务，并在复杂环境中展现出强大的迁移能力，在一系列推理基准上提升性能

Conclusion: WMAct通过解放模型的推理结构，让模型通过"做"来直接塑造思考，实现了高效的世界模型内化，为LLM智能体在复杂环境中的规划和交互提供了新途径

Abstract: Developing robust world model reasoning is crucial for large language model (LLM) agents to plan and interact in complex environments. While multi-turn interaction offers a superior understanding of environmental dynamics via authentic feedback, current approaches often impose a rigid reasoning process, which constrains the model's active learning, ultimately hindering efficient world model reasoning. To address these issues, we explore world-model internalization through efficient interaction and active reasoning (WMAct), which liberates the model from structured reasoning, allowing the model to shape thinking directly through its doing, and achieves effective and efficient world model reasoning with two key mechanisms: (1) a reward rescaling mechanism adjusting outcome reward based on action efficacy to incentivize redundancy reduction and purposeful interaction; (2) an interaction frequency annealing strategy to progressively reduce the maximum allowed interaction turns, which compels the model to condense its learning and internalize environmental dynamics rather than over-relying on environmental cues. Our experiments on Sokoban, Maze, and Taxi show that WMAct yields effective world model reasoning capable of resolving tasks in a single turn that previously required multiple interactions and fosters strong transferability to complex environments, improving performance on a suite of reasoning benchmarks.

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一个两阶段分层优化框架，用于在韩国选择比特币挖矿设施的最佳选址，以利用分布式太阳能盈余，最大化净收益同时考虑物理约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 韩国面临分布式太阳能盈余增长与比特币挖矿等高能耗产业需求的双重挑战。利用挖矿作为灵活负载来货币化"净计量盈余"具有协同效应，但需要稳健的选址方法。传统的GIS多标准决策分析存在主观权重和异构空间数据整合困难的问题。

Method: 开发了两阶段分层优化框架：第一阶段（区域级）采用成本效益优化确定最优区域数量（K*）和组合，通过平衡盈余电力收入与详细土地和非线性基础设施成本来最大化调整后净收益；第二阶段（点级）在选定区域内使用基于GIS的滑动窗口搜索，应用地形（坡度<6.0°）和土地利用约束（30米分辨率）识别可物理建设的"单元站点"。

Result: 模型识别出最优配置为K*=3个区域（龙仁、潭阳、密阳），最大潜在净收益约3.07亿美元。第二阶段筛选显示，最盈利的龙仁区域也是物理约束最大的，87%的站点被过滤掉。

Conclusion: 该研究贡献了一个可扩展、客观的能源基础设施选址框架，有效整合了多尺度空间数据。为政策制定者和电网运营商（如韩国电力公司）提供了数据驱动的策略，以货币化被削减的可再生能源并增强电网稳定性。

Abstract: South Korea faces the dual challenge of managing growing distributed solar energy surpluses and the high energy demand of industries like Bitcoin mining. Leveraging mining operations as a flexible load to monetize this `net-metering surplus' presents a viable synergy, but requires a robust site selection methodology. Traditional GIS-based Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) struggles with subjective weighting and integrating heterogeneous spatial data (areal-level and lattice-level). This thesis develops and implements a Two-Stage Hierarchical Optimization framework to overcome these limitations. Stage 1 (Areal-Level) employs a cost-benefit optimization to determine the optimal number ($K^*$) and combination of regions, maximizing a final adjusted net profit by balancing surplus power revenue against detailed land and non-linear infrastructure costs. Stage 2 (Point-Level) then uses a GIS-based sliding window search within these selected regions, applying topographic (slope $< 6.0^\circ$) and land-use constraints at a 30m resolution to identify physically constructible `unit sites'. The model identified an optimal configuration of $K^*=3$ regions (Yongin, Damyang, Miryang) yielding a maximum potential net profit of approximately \$307 million. Crucially, the Stage 2 screening revealed that Yongin, the most profitable region, was also the most physically constrained, 87\% of sites filtered out. This research contributes a scalable, objective framework for energy infrastructure siting that effectively integrates multi-scale spatial data. It provides a data-driven strategy for policymakers and grid operators (like Korea Electric Power Corporation) to monetize curtailed renewables and enhance grid stability.

Motivation: 边缘化人群（如约旦的移民家政工人）由于污名化和法律限制，难以通过普查或行政数据准确估计其规模。网络规模放大法通常需要已知探针组规模，但在实际应用中往往缺乏可靠的外部数据。

Method: 采用直接探针组方法的网络规模放大法，从调查受访者自身成员身份估计探针组规模，而非依赖外部计数。结合贝叶斯逻辑混合效应模型，在约旦省级层面稳定小区域估计。使用全国代表性家庭调查数据进行验证。

Result: 方法验证显示直接探针组估计能产生可靠推断，揭示了社会网络规模和与移民家政工人连接性的区域差异。该方法比依赖官方记录更可能满足无偏估计的条件。

Conclusion: 直接探针组方法为缺乏已知探针组规模的情况提供了实用替代方案，首次在小区域设置中系统验证了该方法，并为样本量有限的调查调整网络规模放大法提供了指导。

Abstract: Estimating the size of marginalized populations is a persistent challenge in survey statistics and public health, especially where stigma and legal restrictions exclude such groups from census and administrative data. Migrant domestic workers in Jordan represent one such population. We employ the Network Scale-up Method using the direct probe group method, estimating probe group sizes from survey respondents' own membership rather than relying on external counts. Using data from a nationally representative household survey in Jordan, we combine the direct probe group method with Bayesian logistic mixed-effects models to stabilize small-area estimates at the Governorate level. We validate the method against census data, demonstrating that direct probe group estimates yield reliable inference and provide a practical alternative where known probe group sizes are unavailable. Our results highlight regional variation in social network size and connectivity to migrant domestic workers. We argue that the direct probe group method is more likely to satisfy the conditions required for unbiased estimation than relying on official record sizes. This work provides the first systematic validation of the direct probe group method in a small-area setting and offers guidance for adapting the Network Scale-up Method to surveys with limited sample sizes.

Conclusion: 数据简约框架在计算成本显著降低的情况下实现竞争性预测性能，适用于数据稀疏环境的登革热早期检测。

Abstract: Reliable and timely dengue predictions provide actionable lead time for targeted vector control and clinical preparedness, reducing preventable diseases and health-system costs in at-risk communities. Dengue forecasting often relies on site-specific covariates and entomological data, limiting generalizability in data-sparse settings. We propose a data-parsimonious (DP) framework based on the incidence versus cumulative cases (ICC) curve, extending it from a basic SIR to a two-population SEIR model for dengue. Our DP model uses only the target season's incidence time series and estimates only two parameters, reducing noise and computational burden. A Bayesian extension quantifies the case reporting and fitting uncertainty to produce calibrated predictive intervals. We evaluated the performance of the DP model in the 2022-2023 outbreaks in Florida, where standardized clinical tests and reporting support accurate case determination. The DP framework demonstrates competitive predictive performance at substantially lower computational cost than more elaborate models, making it suitable for dengue early detection where dense surveillance or long historical records are unavailable.

Conclusion: 提出的SDE模型和滤波方法为处理动物追踪数据中的复杂误差模式提供了有效的统计工具，特别适用于受空间约束的动物运动分析。

Abstract: Advances in tracking technologies for animal movement require new statistical tools to better exploit the increasing amount of data. Animal positions are usually calculated using the GPS or Argos satellite system and include potentially complex non-Gaussian and heavy-tailed measurement error patterns. Errors are usually handled through a Kalman filter algorithm, which can be sensitive to non-Gaussian error distributions.
  In this paper, we introduce a realistic latent movement model through an underdamped Langevin stochastic differential equation (SDE) that includes an additional drift term to ensure that the animal remains in a known spatial domain of interest. This can be applied to aquatic animals moving in water or terrestrial animals moving in a restricted zone delimited by fences or natural barriers. We demonstrate that the incorporation of these spatial constraints into the latent movement model improves the accuracy of filtering for noisy observations of the positions. We implement an Extended Kalman Filter as well as a particle filter adapted to non-Gaussian error distributions. Our filters are based on solving the SDE through splitting schemes to approximate the latent dynamic.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决城市空气质量建模中的关键挑战：如何利用低成本传感器（特别是车载网络部署的）数据来预测未监测位置的污染物浓度。低成本传感器提供了新的数据源，但需要评估其建模效果和可靠性。

Method: 对现有文献中的10种统计模型进行全面综述，使用法国南特市的固定和移动低成本传感器数据以及辅助变量。采用交叉验证方法，将低成本传感器数据与固定空气质量监测站数据进行验证，评估模型在时间插值和预测场景中的性能。

Result: 发现仅依赖低成本传感器数据的模型输出存在显著偏差；机器学习模型在预测场景中表现更优；低成本移动传感器数据的准确性不足会影响空气质量模型的可靠性。

Conclusion: 不应仅依赖低成本移动传感器数据，而应重点将低成本传感器数据与固定监测站数据进行整合和校准。相比单纯追求统计建模技术的复杂性，这种数据整合方法对于实现有效空气质量管理和政策制定所需的精度更为关键。

Abstract: This study addresses the critical challenge of modeling and mapping urban air quality to ascertain pollutant concentrations in unmonitored locations. The advent of low-cost sensors, particularly those deployed in vehicular networks, presents novel datasets that hold the potential to enhance air quality modeling. This research conducts a comprehensive review of ten statistical models drawn from existing literature, using both fixed and mobile low-cost sensor data, alongside ancillary variables, within the urban confines of Nantes, France.
  Employing a methodology that includes cross-validation of data from low-cost sensors and validation on fixed air quality monitoring stations, this paper evaluates the models' performance in scenarios of temporal interpolation and prediction. Our findings reveal a pronounced bias in the model outputs when reliant on low-cost sensor data compared to the verification data obtained from fixed stations. Furthermore, machine learning models demonstrated superior performance in predictive scenarios, suggesting their enhanced suitability for forecasting tasks.
  The study conclusively indicates that reliance solely on data from low-cost mobile sensors compromises the reliability of air quality models, due to significant accuracy deficiencies. Consequently, we advocate for a directed focus towards the integration and calibration of low-cost sensor data with information from fixed monitoring stations. This approach, rather than an exclusive emphasis on the complexity of statistical modeling techniques, is pivotal for achieving the precision required for effective air quality management and policy-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释为什么内部效度和外部效度不能同时最大化，揭示因果推断中操作顺序依赖性的结构基础，为常见的可迁移性失败提供理论解释。

Method: 引入"证据状态"概念表示因果推断可用信息，分析限制、条件化和干预三种常规操作如何以不可交换的方式转换证据状态，通过小型模型、观察性和实验性案例说明操作顺序依赖性。

Result: 证明因果推断操作具有非交换性，改变操作顺序会产生支持不同因果主张的证据状态，导致结构性权衡：确保精确因果识别的步骤会消除推广所需的异质性。

Conclusion: 提高因果精确性必然缩小研究结果的适用范围，内部效度与外部效度之间存在固有的结构性权衡，这解释了为什么研究结果难以在不同情境间迁移。

Abstract: This paper explains why internal and external validity cannot be simultaneously maximised. It introduces "evidential states" to represent the information available for causal inference and shows that routine study operations (restriction, conditioning, and intervention) transform these states in ways that do not commute. Because each operation removes or reorganises information differently, changing their order yields evidential states that support different causal claims. This non-commutativity creates a structural trade-off: the steps that secure precise causal identification also eliminate the heterogeneity required for generalisation. Small model, observational and experimental examples illustrate how familiar failures of transportability arise from this order dependence. The result is a concise structural account of why increasing causal precision necessarily narrows the world to which findings apply.

Abstract: : One of the prominent challenges being faced by agricultural sciences is the onset of climate change which is adversely affecting every aspect of cropping. Modelling of climate change at macro level have been carried out at large scale and there is ample amount of research publications available for that. But at micro level like at state level or district level there are lesser studies. District level studies can help in preparing specific plans for the mitigation of adverse effects of climate change at local level. An attempt has been made in this paper to model the monthly rainfall of Varanasi district of the state of Uttar Pradesh with the help of probability models. Firstly, the pattern of the climate change over 122 years has been unveiled by using exploratory analysis and using multivariate techniques like cluster analysis and then probability models have been fitted for selected months

### [66] [Multi-fidelity Bayesian Optimization Framework for CFD-Based Non-Premixed Burner Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23140)
*Patrick Souza Lima,Paulo Roberto Santana dos Reis,Alex Álisson Bandeira Santos,Ehecatl Antonio del Río Chanona,Idelfonso Bessa dos Reis Nogueira*

Main category: stat.AP

TL;DR: 提出多保真贝叶斯优化框架，结合CFD模拟与高斯过程代理模型，通过自适应调整网格分辨率平衡精度与计算成本，应用于氢富燃料燃烧器优化，相比单保真方法减少57%计算时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在计算流体动力学（CFD）优化中，高精度模拟计算成本高昂，而低精度模拟精度不足。需要一种能自适应平衡精度与计算成本的方法，特别是在工业燃烧器设计等需要大量CFD模拟的应用中。

Method: 提出多保真贝叶斯优化（MF-BO）框架，将设计变量x=[h,l,s]（高度、长度、网格尺寸）映射为连续保真度指数Z(h,l,s)。使用高斯过程代理模型结合CFD评估，采用带约束的噪声期望改进（qNEI）采样策略，并建立计算时间模型t_hat(h,l,s)来惩罚昂贵查询。

Result: 代理模型表现出稳定的超参数和物理一致的敏感性：平均温度随反应器长度和保真度增加而升高，与高度呈弱负相关；NOx随温度升高而增加，但随长度增加而减少。最佳设计达到约2000K的平均温度，同时满足NOx排放限制（2e-6）。相比单保真方法（Z=1），MF-BO在达到相似收敛水平时减少了约57%的总计算时间。

Conclusion: 该方法为反应流系统优化提供了一条通用且计算成本可控的路径，通过自适应结合低精度和高精度CFD模拟，显著加速设计周期并减少资源需求，在工业燃烧器开发和其他高成本CFD驱动应用中具有重要潜力。

Abstract: We propose a multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization (MF-BO) framework that integrates computational fluid dynamics (CFD) evaluations with Gaussian-process surrogates to efficiently navigate the accuracy-cost trade-off induced by mesh resolution. The design vector x = [h, l, s] (height, length, and mesh element size) defines a continuous fidelity index Z(h, l, s), enabling the optimizer to adaptively combine low- and high-resolution simulations. This framework is applied to a non-premixed burner configuration targeting improved thermal efficiency under hydrogen-enriched fuels. A calibrated runtime model t_hat(h, l, s) penalizes computationally expensive queries, while a constrained noisy expected improvement (qNEI) guides sampling under an emissions cap of 2e-6 for NOx.
  Surrogates trained on CFD data exhibit stable hyperparameters and physically consistent sensitivities: mean temperature increases with reactor length and fidelity and is weakly negative with height; NOx grows with temperature yet tends to decrease with length. The best design achieves T_bar approx 2.0e3 K while satisfying the NOx limit.
  Relative to a hypothetical single-fidelity campaign (Z = 1), the MF-BO achieves comparable convergence with about 57 percent lower total wall time by learning the design landscape through fast low-Z evaluations and reserving high-Z CFD for promising candidates. Overall, the methodology offers a generalizable and computationally affordable path for optimizing reacting-flow systems in which mesh-driven fidelity inherently couples accuracy, cost, and emissions. This highlights its potential to accelerate design cycles and reduce resource requirements in industrial burner development and other high-cost CFD-driven applications.

Main category: stat.AP

TL;DR: 提出PAS方法，一种多保真度筛选技术，用于高效准确预测非线性波浪载荷的极端值，相比传统蒙特卡洛模拟可节省96%的高保真模拟时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 海洋和海岸结构设计需要极端载荷值，但非线性罕见事件的预测计算成本极高，传统方法难以兼顾精度与效率。

Method: 提出概率自适应筛选(PAS)方法，采用多保真度策略：低保真阶段使用线性势流指标，自适应筛选关键工况进行高保真模拟。

Result: PAS在所有测试案例中准确预测短期分布和极端值，最可能最大值误差在10%内，仅需传统蒙特卡洛模拟4%的高保真模拟时间。

Conclusion: PAS能可靠重现弱/强非线性极端载荷统计特性，显著降低计算成本，未来需验证CFD模拟和长期极端值预测。

Abstract: To ensure the safety of marine and coastal structures, extreme (design) values should be known at the design stage. But for such complex systems, estimating the magnitude of events which are both non-linear and rare is extremely challenging, and involves considerable computational cost to capture the high-fidelity physics. To address this challenge, we offer a new multi-fidelity screening method, Probabilistic Adaptive Screening (PAS), which accurately predicts extreme values of strongly non-linear wave-induced loads while minimising the required high-fidelity simulation duration. The method introduces a probabilistic approach to multi-fidelity screening, allowing efficient linear potential flow indicators to be used in the low-fidelity stage, even for strongly non-linear load cases. The method is validated against a range of cases, including non-linear waves, and ship vertical bending moments, green water impact loads, and slamming loads. It can be concluded that PAS accurately estimates both the short-term distributions and extreme values in all test cases, with most probable maximum (MPM) values within 10\% of the available full brute-force Monte-Carlo Simulation (MCS) results. In addition, PAS achieves this performance very efficiently, requiring less than 4\% of the high-fidelity simulation time needed for conventional MCS. These results demonstrate that PAS can reliably reproduce the statistics of both weakly and strongly non-linear extreme load problems, while significantly reducing the associated computational cost. The present study validates the statistical PAS framework; further work should focus on validating the full procedure including CFD load simulations, and on validating it for long-term extremes.

Conclusion: LILAD提供了一个统一框架，能够同时保证系统辨识的适应性和稳定性，即使在分布外和任务外场景下也能保持稳定，为实际应用提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: System identification in control theory aims to approximate dynamical systems from trajectory data. While neural networks have demonstrated strong predictive accuracy, they often fail to preserve critical physical properties such as stability and typically assume stationary dynamics, limiting their applicability under distribution shifts. Existing approaches generally address either stability or adaptability in isolation, lacking a unified framework that ensures both. We propose LILAD (Learning In-Context Lyapunov-stable Adaptive Dynamics), a novel framework for system identification that jointly guarantees adaptability and stability. LILAD simultaneously learns a dynamics model and a Lyapunov function through in-context learning (ICL), explicitly accounting for parametric uncertainty. Trained across a diverse set of tasks, LILAD produces a stability-aware, adaptive dynamics model alongside an adaptive Lyapunov certificate. At test time, both components adapt to a new system instance using a short trajectory prompt, which enables fast generalization. To rigorously ensure stability, LILAD also computes a state-dependent attenuator that enforces a sufficient decrease condition on the Lyapunov function for any state in the new system instance. This mechanism extends stability guarantees even under out-of-distribution and out-of-task scenarios. We evaluate LILAD on benchmark autonomous systems and demonstrate that it outperforms adaptive, robust, and non-adaptive baselines in predictive accuracy.

Abstract: As the automotive industry moves towards vehicle electrification, designing and optimizing thermal management systems (TMSs) for Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) has become a critical focus in recent years. The dependence of battery performance on operating temperature, the lack of waste combustion heat, and the significant effect of TMS energy consumption on driving range make the design of BEV TMSs highly complicated compared to conventional vehicles. Although prior research has focused on optimizing the configuration of thermal systems for varying ambient conditions, a holistic approach to studying the full potential of reconfigurable TMS architectures has not yet been fully explored. The complex design landscape of multi-mode reconfigurable systems is difficult to navigate. Relying solely on expert intuition and creativity to identify new architectures both restricts progress and leaves significant performance improvements unrealized. In this study, using graph modelling of TMS architectures, we propose a systematic method to automatically enumerate and simulate reconfigurable architectures for a TMS, given the desired operating modes, along with a framework to conduct transient performance analysis and optimization-based trade-off studies among system performance, energy consumption, and complexity. We explored more than 150 operating mode sequences, retaining 39 unique architectures for further evaluation. MATLAB Simscape models of these architectures were automatically created and their performance evaluated. The multi-objective optimization results provide decision support for selecting the best architecture based on user priorities.

Abstract: This paper focuses on the problem of quantized distributed estimation with event-triggered communication and packet loss, aiming to reduce the number of transmitted bits. The main challenge lies in the inability to differentiate between an untriggered event and a packet loss occurrence. This paper proposes an event-triggered distributed estimation algorithm with quantized communication and quantized measurement, in which it introduces a one-bit information reconstruction method to deal with packet loss. The almost sure convergence and convergence rate of the proposed algorithm are established.Besides, it is demonstrated that the global average communication bit-rate decreases to zero over time. Moreover, the trade-off between communication rate and convergence rate is revealed, providing guidance for designing the communication rate required to achieve the algorithm's convergence rate. A numerical example is supplied to validate the findings.

Abstract: The design of tracking controllers that closely follow a reference trajectory while ensuring safety and robustness against disturbances is a challenging problem in the control of autonomous systems. In this work, we propose a neural network-based safe tracking control framework for nonlinear discrete-time systems with reach-avoid specifications in the presence of disturbances. Our approach begins with generation of a nominal trajectory using standard trajectory synthesis approaches, followed by construction of safe zonotopic backward reachable sets along the nominal trajectory. The states lying within the backward reachable sets are guaranteed to satisfy safe reachability specifications. Then, our key insight is to leverage the computed backward reachable sets to inform the architecture and training of a neural network-based tracking controller such that the neural network drives the system's states through these backward reachable sets, thereby improving the likelihood of safe reachability. We perform formal verification with conformal prediction to achieve statistical safety guarantees on the performance of the learned neural controller. The performance of our approach is illustrated through a numerical example on the discrete-time Dubin's car model.

Abstract: Communication-aware control is essential to reduce costs and complexity in large-scale networks. However, it is challenging to simultaneously determine a sparse communication topology and achieve high performance and robustness. This work achieves all three objectives through dissipativity-based, sparsity-promoting controller synthesis. The approach identifies an optimal sparse structure using either weighted l1 penalties or alternating direction methods of multipliers (ADMM) with a cardinality term, and iteratively solves a convexified version of the NP hard structured optimal control problem. The proposed methods are demonstrated on heterogeneous networks with uncertain and unstable agents.

Conclusion: 提出的解析MSE表达式为基准研究中的性能评估提供了准确且计算高效的工具，特别是在真实系统动态未知且轨迹较长的情况下。

Abstract: We propose analytical mean square error (MSE) expressions for the Kalman filter (KF) and the Kalman smoother (KS) for benchmark studies, where the true system dynamics are unknown or unavailable to the estimator. In such cases, as in benchmark evaluations for target tracking, the analysis relies on deterministic state trajectories. This setting introduces a model mismatch between the estimator and the system, causing the covariance estimates to no longer reflect the actual estimation errors. To enable accurate performance prediction for fixed state trajectories without relying on computationally intensive Monte Carlo simulations, we derive recursive MSE expressions with linear time complexity. The proposed framework also accounts for measurement model mismatch and provides an efficient tool for performance evaluation in benchmark studies with long trajectories. Simulation results confirm the accuracy and computational efficiency of the proposed method.

Abstract: By introducing two polar coordinates transformations, the marine vessel's original two-input-three-output second-order tracking model can be reduced to a two-input-two-output feedback form. However, the resulting system does not confirm to the strict-feedback structure, leading to potential singularity when designing the stabilizing function for the virtual input in the recursive controller design. Moreover, the polar coordinate transformation itself inherently introduces singularities. To address these singularity issues, this paper employs a control barrier function (CBF) based approach and formulates the trajectory tracking problem as a quadratic program (QP) solved via a QP optimizer. Numerical simulations are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract: This note proposes a data-driven output-feedback stabilizing policy iteration for unknown linear discrete-time systems with unmeasurable states. Existing policy iteration methods for optimal control must start from a stabilizing control policy, which is particularly challenging to obtain for unknown systems, especially when states are unavailable. In such cases, it is more difficult to guarantee stability and convergence performance. To address this problem, an output-feedback stabilizing policy iteration framework is developed to learn closed-loop stabilizing control policies while ensuring convergence performance. Specifically, cumulative scalar parameters are introduced to compress the original system to a stable scale. Then, by integrating modified policy iteration with parameter update rules, the system is gradually amplified/restored to the original system while preserving stability such that the stabilizing control policy is obtained. The entire process is driven solely by input-output data. Moreover, a stability analysis is provided for output-feedback. The proposed approach is validated by simulations.

Abstract: Coordinated optimization dispatch (COD) of transmission system operator (TSO) and distribution system operator (DSO) can effectively ensure system security and efficiency under high-penetration distributed energy resource (DER) integration. Researches of large-scale COD problem can be categorized into iterative approaches that allow DSO to dispatch independently, and non-iterative methods based on projections of feasible regions (FR). However, the iterative methods suffer from low computational convergence and efficiency, while non-iterative methods struggle to solve equivalent projections with high-dimensional FR. To address these issues, this paper proposes a TSO-DSO coordinated dispatch approach based on an accelerated non-iterative Equality Set Projection (ESP) algorithm. First, ESP algorithm is employed to overcome the bottleneck of high-dimensional FR construction. Second, an regularization-based accelerated method is proposed to reduce computational burden when degeneracy occurs. Accelerated ESP algorithm constructs projection of FR via adjacent facet searching. Therefore, it is less sensitive to the increase of vertices and could efficiently construct the projection of high-dimensional FR. Case studies on a polyhedron dataset, IEEE 33-Bus System and T118D10 TSO-DSO system demonstrate the effectiveness and computational efficiency of the proposed COD approach.

Abstract: This paper addresses the joint scheduling problem of stochastic workloads and a hydrogen-enabled distributed energy system in a low-carbon Internet data centers (IDC). Although such workloads can be shifted over temporal and spatial horizons, it poses challenges when they cannot be accurately predicted, resulting in significant efficiency degradation and high operational cost of the energy system. The problem becomes even more difficult when the workload shifting decisions would influence their randomness, which is natural for the IDC workloads. To tackle these issues, we propose a workload classification model based on the decision-dependent uncertainty set, where the spatiotemporal elasticity of different types of random workloads are clearly identified and the decision dependencies are explicitly described as linear constraints. Thus, a mixed integer program is then established for the optimal scheduling of both workload demand and energy supply. To enhance system resilience against high volatility scenarios, a rolling horizon algorithm is developed to ensure nonanticipativity and full-scenario feasibility. Numerical tests demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits effective workload scheduling decisions with dramatic energy operational cost reductions compared to the benchmarks under most of the uncertain scenarios.

Abstract: This paper presents a unified and scalable framework for predictive and safe autonomous navigation in dynamic transportation environments by integrating model predictive control (MPC) with distributed Koopman operator learning. High-dimensional sensory data are employed to model and forecast the motion of surrounding dynamic obstacles. A consensus-based distributed Koopman learning algorithm enables multiple computational agents or sensing units to collaboratively estimate the Koopman operator without centralized data aggregation, thereby supporting large-scale and communication-efficient learning across a networked system. The learned operator predicts future spatial densities of obstacles, which are subsequently represented through Gaussian mixture models. Their confidence ellipses are approximated by convex polytopes and embedded as linear constraints in the MPC formulation to guarantee safe and collision-free navigation. The proposed approach not only ensures obstacle avoidance but also scales efficiently with the number of sensing or computational nodes, aligning with cooperative perception principles in intelligent transportation system (ITS) applications. Theoretical convergence guarantees and predictive constraint formulations are established, and extensive simulations demonstrate reliable, safe, and computationally efficient navigation performance in complex environments.

Abstract: In Model Predictive Control (MPC), the objective function plays a central role in determining the closed-loop behavior of the system, and must therefore be designed to achieve the desired closed-loop performance. However, in real-world scenarios, its design is often challenging, as it requires balancing complex trade-offs and accurately capturing a performance criterion that may not be easily quantifiable in terms of an objective function. This paper explores preference-based learning as a data-driven approach to constructing an objective function from human preferences over trajectory pairs. We formulate the learning problem as a machine learning classification task to learn a surrogate model that estimates the likelihood of a trajectory being preferred over another. The approach provides a surrogate model that can directly be used as an MPC objective function. Numerical results show that we can learn objective functions that provide closed-loop trajectories that align with the expressed human preferences.

Abstract: Due to changes in frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, such as heatwaves and storms, power systems around the globe are having to deal with increased imbalance between demand and supply and additional risk of loss of supply, calling for advanced control strategies that strengthen system resilience. This paper develops a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework for coordination of Virtual Power Plants (VPPs) that manages photovoltaic (PV) systems, batteries, and loads before, during, and after extreme weather events. A multi-objective mixed-integer quadratically constrained program is solved to enforce customer-priority tiers, serving critical loads first, while minimizing operating cost and PV curtailment under network and device constraints. Simulations on the IEEE 33-bus distribution network with real UK heatwave data show that, under realistic forecast errors and modeling uncertainties, MPC improves resilience by 11-20% relative to traditional full-horizon optimization. These results indicate the practical viability of receding-horizon coordination for resilient, low-carbon VPP operation during extreme weather.

Abstract: Underground mining operations are actively exploring the use of large-format lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) to power their equipment. LIBs have high energy density, long cycle life, and favorable safety record. They also have low noise, heat, and emission footprints. This fosters a conducive workplace environment for underground mining personnel. However, many occurrences of LIB failure have resulted in dangerous situations in underground mines. The combustion products, including toxic emissions, can rapidly travel throughout the mine using the ventilation network. Therefore, it is critical to monitor the temperature and smoke concentration underground at all times to ensure the safety of the miners. High-fidelity models can be developed for specific scenarios of LIB failure, but are computationally prohibitive for large underground mine volumes, complex geometries, and long duration combustion events. To mitigate computation-related issues associated with high-fidelity models, we developed cyber-physical systems (CPS) models to examine temperature and smoke dynamics. The mine supervisory control center, acting as the cyber framework, operates in conjunction with the physical underground mine. The CPS models, trained on high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model data sets, present an exceptional estimate of the evolution of temperature and smoke concentration in the underground mine tunnel. Once implemented, the research results can help mine operators make informed decisions during emergencies.

Abstract: Power systems are globally experiencing an unprecedented growth in size and complexity due to the advent of nonconventional generation and consumption technologies. To navigate computational complexity, power system dynamic models are often reduced using techniques based on singular perturbation. However, several technical assumptions enabling traditional approaches are being challenged due to the heterogeneous, and often black-box, nature of modern power system component models. This work proposes two singular perturbation approaches that aim to optimally identify fast states that shall be reduced, without prior knowledge about the physical meaning of system states. After presenting a timescale-agnostic formulation for singular perturbation, the first approach uses greedy optimization to sequentially select states to be reduced. The second approach relies on a nonlinear optimization routine allowing state transformations while obtaining an optimally reduced model. Numerical studies on a test system featuring synchronous machines, inverters, and line dynamics demonstrate the generalizability and accuracy of the developed approaches.

Abstract: This work presents an event-triggered switching control framework for a class of nonlinear underactuated multi-channel systems with input constraints. These systems are inspired by cooperative manipulation tasks involving underactuation, where multiple underactuated agents collaboratively push or pull an object to a target pose. Unlike existing approaches for multi-channel systems, our method addresses underactuation and the potential loss of controllability by additionally addressing channel assignment of agents. To simultaneously account for channel assignment, input constraints, and stabilization, we formulate the control problem as a Mixed Integer Linear Programming and derive sufficient conditions for its feasibility. To improve real-time computation efficiency, we introduce an event-triggered control scheme that maintains stability even between switching events through a quadratic programming-based stabilizing controller. We theoretically establish the semi-global exponential stability of the proposed method and the asymptotic stability of its extension to nonprehensile cooperative manipulation under noninstantaneous switching. The proposed framework is further validated through numerical simulations on 2D and 3D free-flyer systems and multi-robot nonprehensile pushing tasks.

Abstract: Serving as an essential prerequisite for modern power system operation, robust state estimation (RSE) could effectively resist noises and outliers in measurements. The emerging neural network (NN) based end-to-end (E2E) learning framework enables real-time application of RSE but cannot strictly enforce the physical constraints involved, potentially yielding solutions that are statistically accurate yet physically inconsistent. To bridge this gap, this work proposes a novel E2E learning based RSE framework, where the RSE problem is innovatively constructed as an explicit differentiable layer of NN for the first time, ensuring physics alignments with rigors. Also, the measurement weights are treated as learnable parameters of NN to enhance estimation robustness. A hybrid loss function is formulated to pursue accurate and physically consistent solutions. To realize the proposed NN structure, the original non-convex RSE problem is specially relaxed. Extensive numerical simulations have been carried out to demonstrate that the proposed framework can significantly improve the SE performance while fulfilling physical consistency on six testing systems, in comparisons to the classical E2E learning based approach and the physics-informed neural network (PINN) approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统光遗传学仅依赖光强度控制，在剂量响应关系陡峭时难以实现精细调节，只能在全激活或全抑制之间切换，缺乏中间调控能力。脉冲宽度调制虽能缓解此问题，但作为混合整数规划问题，随着时间网格分辨率和强迫周期数增加，决策变量急剧增长，计算不可行。

Method: 提出基于强化学习的替代方案，将控制动作参数化为占空比——一个连续变量，用于编码每个强迫周期内的ON-OFF开关时间，同时尊重光强度的二进制本质特性。

Result: 该方法将脉冲宽度调制的开关时间最优控制问题转化为连续变量优化问题，避免了混合整数规划中决策变量随时间和周期数指数增长的计算复杂度问题。

Conclusion: 强化学习框架通过占空比参数化提供了一种计算可行的解决方案，能够平滑平均响应并增强光遗传学生物过程的可控性，特别适用于剂量响应关系陡峭的情况。

Abstract: Biotechnology can benefit from dynamic control to improve production efficiency. In this context, optogenetics enables modulation of gene expression using light as an external input, allowing fine-tuning of protein levels to unlock dynamic metabolic control and regulation of cell growth. Optogenetic systems can be actuated by light intensity. However, relying solely on intensity-driven control (i.e., signal amplitude) may fail to properly tune optogenetic bioprocesses when the dose-response relationship (i.e., light intensity versus gene-expression strength) is steep. In these cases, tunability is effectively constrained to either fully active or fully repressed gene expression, with little intermediate regulation. Pulse-width modulation, a concept widely used in electronics, can alleviate this issue by alternating between fully ON and OFF light intensity within forcing periods, thereby smoothing the average response and enhancing process controllability. Naturally, optimizing pulse-width-modulated optogenetics entails a switching-time optimal control problem with a binary input over many forcing periods. While this can be formulated as a mixed-integer program on a refined time grid, the number of decision variables can grow rapidly with increasing time-grid resolution and number of forcing periods, compromising tractability. Here, we propose an alternative solution based on reinforcement learning. We parametrize control actions via the duty cycle, a continuous variable that encodes the ON-to-OFF switching time within each forcing period, thereby respecting the intrinsic binary nature of the light intensity.

Abstract: This paper addresses the distributed Nash Equilibrium seeking problem for aggregative games, where legitimate players' decisions are affected by potential malicious players. To describe players' behavior, we introduce a novel heterogeneous trustworthiness probabilistic framework by employing stochastic trust observations. To mitigate the waste of communication and gradient computation, we utilize a compressible unbalanced network information matrix and a multi-round communication mechanism to develop a fast Nash equilibrium seeking algorithm for aggregative games with unbalanced directed networks. By integrating the multi-round communication mechanism and a trustworthiness broadcast mechanism, we embed our fast convergence algorithm into the heterogeneous trustworthiness probabilistic framework, yielding a resilient fast Nash equilibrium seeking algorithm. Theoretical analysis confirms the convergence of the algorithm. Comparative simulations verify the accuracy of our fast convergence algorithm, and validation simulations verify the resilience of the algorithm.

Abstract: Data-Enabled Predictive Control (DeePC) offers a powerful model-free approach to predictive control, but faces two fundamental challenges: computational complexity scaling cubically with dataset size, and severe performance degradation from corrupted data. This paper introduces Robust Data Selection DeePC (RDS-DeePC), which addresses both challenges through influence function analysis. We derive a sensitivity score quantifying each trajectory segment's leverage on the optimization solution, proving that high-sensitivity segments correspond to outliers while low-sensitivity segments represent consistent data. By selecting low-sensitivity segments, RDS-DeePC achieves computational efficiency and automatic outlier filtering without requiring data quality labels. For nonlinear systems, we extend the framework through a two-stage online selection approach accelerated by the LiSSA algorithm.

Abstract: Roll-to-roll (R2R) manufacturing demands precise tension and velocity control under strict operational constraints. Model predictive control requires gradient computation, while sampling-based methods such as MPPI struggle with hard constraint satisfaction.

Abstract: Electric propulsion is used to maximize payload capacity in communication satellites. These orbit raising maneuvers span several months and hundreds of revolutions, making trajectory design a complex challenge. The literature typically addresses this problem using feedback laws, with Q-law being one of the most prominent approaches. However, Q-law suffers from closed-loop stability issues, limiting its suitability for real-time on-board implementation. In this work, we focus on closed-loop orbit raising rather than offline trajectory planning and address the stability limitations of the Q-law through a Lyapunov based control design. A Lyapunov-guided modification of the classical Q-law is proposed to ensure closed-loop stability and enable real-time implementation. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through closed-loop orbit transfers across various scenarios, including co-planar transfers, equatorial to polar orbit transfers, and geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) to geostationary earth orbit (GEO) transfers.

*Shubham Sawarkar,Pushpak Jagtap*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 提出一种无需在线学习或不确定性估计的预定时间可达避障控制框架，通过虚拟系统生成安全参考轨迹，使用无近似反馈律将真实系统限制在虚拟约束区内，保证未知动态下的实时安全性和预定时间目标可达性。

Conclusion: 提出的框架为未知动态非线性系统在动态环境中的预定时间可达避障控制提供了一种有效解决方案，无需模型学习或不确定性估计，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: We study the prescribed-time reach-avoid (PT-RA) control problem for nonlinear systems with unknown dynamics operating in environments with moving obstacles. Unlike robust or learning based Control Barrier Function (CBF) methods, the proposed framework requires neither online model learning nor uncertainty bound estimation. A CBF-based Quadratic Program (CBF-QP) is solved on a simple virtual system to generate a safe reference satisfying PT-RA conditions with respect to time-varying, tightened obstacle and goal sets. The true system is confined to a Virtual Confinement Zone (VCZ) around this reference using an approximation-free feedback law. This construction guarantees real-time safety and prescribed-time target reachability under unknown dynamics and dynamic constraints without explicit model identification or offline precomputation. Simulation results illustrate reliable dynamic obstacle avoidance and timely convergence to the target set.

Result: 仿真验证了方法的有效性，能够在保持原始共识收敛的同时防止拓扑被准确推断

Conclusion: 提出了一种保护共识网络拓扑隐私的有效方法，在保持系统功能的同时增强了安全性

Abstract: Consensus networks are widely deployed in numerous civil and industrial applications. However, the process of reaching a common consensus among nodes can unintentionally reveal the network's topology to external observers by appropriate inference techniques. This paper investigates a feedback-based resistant inference design to prevent the topology from being inferred using data, while preserving the original consensus convergence. First, we characterize the conditions to preserve the original consensus, and introduce the ''accurate inference'' notion, which accounts for both the uniqueness of the solution to topology inference (solvability) and the deviation from the original topology (accuracy). Then, we employ invariant subspace analysis to characterize the solvability. Even when unique inference remains possible, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the feedback design to induce inaccurate inference, and give a Laplacian structure based distributed design. Simulations validate the effectiveness of the method.

Abstract: This paper puts forward a framework to accelerate Electromagnetic Transient (EMT) simulations by replacing individual components with trained Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). EMT simulations are considered the cornerstone of transient stability assessment of power systems with high shares of Inverter-Based Resources (IBRs), and, although accurate, they are notorious for their slow simulation speed. Taking a deeper dive into the EMT simulation algorithms, this paper identifies the most computationally expensive components of the simulation and replaces them with fast and accurate PINNs. The proposed novel PINN formulation enables a modular and scalable integration into the simulation algorithm. Using a type-4 wind turbine EMT model, we demonstrate a 4--6x simulation speedup by capturing the Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) with a PINN. We validate all our results with PSCAD software.

Abstract: Providing rigorous reachability guarantees for unknown complex systems is a crucial and challenging task. In this paper, we present a novel data-driven framework that addresses this challenge by leveraging Koopman operator theory. Instead of operating in the state space, the proposed method encodes model uncertainty from finite data directly into Koopman spectral representation with quantifiable error bounds. Leveraging this spectral information, we systematically determine time intervals within which trajectories from the initial set are guaranteed, with a prescribed probability, to reach the target set. This enables the rigorous reachability verification without explicit computation of reachable sets, thereby offering a significant advantage in scalability and applicability. We finally validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework through case studies on representative dynamical systems.

Conclusion: 该研究成功实现了基于NOMA的激光OWC网络优化，动态分组和功率分配算法有效解决了复杂优化问题，显著提升了系统性能。

Abstract: OWC has been considered as a key enabling technology to unlock unprecedented speeds of communication, supporting high demands of data traffic. In this paper, infrared lasers are used as optical transmitters operating in an indoor environment under eye safety regulations due to their high modulation speed. To provide efficient multiple access service, NOMA-based transmission is implemented to multiplex messages intended to multiple users in the power domain and maximize the spectral efficiency of our laser-based OWC network. In particular, a BIA outer precoder is designed to coordinate the transmission among multiple APs and determine the precoding matrices for groups of users potential formed according to NOMA principles. For effective use of NOMA, an optimization problem is formulated to maximize the sum rate of the network through forming optimum groups under certain joint conditions, efficient power allocation, high quality of service for each weak and strong users, and high overall system performance. Such optimization problems are defined as max-min fractional programs difficult to solve in practice. Therefore, a dynamic application for NOMA is introduced using two algorithms. First, a RF-aided dynamic algorithm is designed to form multiple groups, where users exchange binary variables among them through an RF system to establish distance-based weight edges, which are used as a metric for the grouping process. Second, a dynamic power allocation is proposed to determine the optimum power allocated to each group, while the users belonging to a certain group receive their traffic demands regardless of their classification as weak or strong. The results show the convergence of the proposed dynamic application to the optimum solution, and its high performance in terms of sum rate, fairness, and energy efficiency compared to counterpart schemes.

Motivation: 针对非线性离散时间系统在测量噪声和可能无界未知输入下的状态估计问题，需要开发能够处理这些挑战的鲁棒估计方法。

Method: 首先提出强非线性可检测性概念作为未知输入状态估计器存在的充要条件。然后设计基于移动水平估计的UISE，使用全阶模型和过去及当前测量值。进一步收紧可检测性概念，设计计算效率更高的两阶段MHE-based UISE。

Conclusion: 本文为非线性系统在未知输入下的状态估计提供了理论框架和实用算法，强非线性可检测性概念是关键理论贡献，MHE-based UISE方法在实际应用中具有优势。

Abstract: This paper considers state estimation for general nonlinear discrete-time systems subject to measurement noise and possibly unbounded unknown inputs. To approach this problem, we first propose the concept of strong nonlinear detectability. This condition is sufficient and necessary for the existence of unknown input state estimators (UISEs), which reconstruct states from noisy sampled measurements and yield bounded estimation error even for unbounded unknown inputs. Based on the proposed detectability notion, a UISE is designed via a moving horizon estimation strategy using a full-order model as well as past and current measurements. Next, we tighten this detectability notion to design a two-stage MHE-based UISE, which is computationally more efficient than the MHE-based UISE using full-order models. In a simulation example with a plant growth process, both variants of MHE-based UISEs are compared with a conventional MHE to illustrate the merits of the developed methods.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel Lyapunov-based small-gain methodology for establishing fixed-time stability (FxTS) guarantees in interconnected dynamical systems. Specifically, we consider interconnections in which each subsystem admits an individual fixed-time input-to-state stability (ISS) Lyapunov function that certifies FxT-ISS. We then show that if a nonlinear small-gain condition is satisfied, then the entire interconnected system is FxTS. Our results are analogous to existing Lyapunov-based small-gain theorems developed for asymptotic and finite-time stability, thereby filling an important gap in the stability analysis of interconnected dynamical systems. The proposed theoretical tools are further illustrated through analytical and numerical examples, including an application to fixed-time feedback optimization of dynamical systems without time-scale separation between the plant and the controller.

Abstract: This paper investigates nonlinear panel regression models with interactive fixed effects and introduces a general framework for parameter estimation under potentially non-convex objective functions. We propose a computationally feasible two-step estimation procedure. In the first step, nuclear-norm regularization (NNR) is used to obtain preliminary estimators of the coefficients of interest, factors, and factor loadings. The second step involves an iterative procedure for post-NNR inference, improving the convergence rate of the coefficient estimator. We establish the asymptotic properties of both the preliminary and iterative estimators. We also study the determination of the number of factors. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in determining the number of factors and estimating the model parameters. In our empirical application, we apply the proposed approach to study the cross-market arbitrage behavior of U.S. nonfinancial firms.

Motivation: 现有面板数据因果推断方法通常通过调整未观测异质性分布来处理选择偏差，但这种方法对识别策略敏感。作者希望开发一种更稳健的方法，能够在多种不同的面板数据识别策略下恢复平均处理效应

Method: 使用面板数据寻找与处理组在预处理结果上相似的"接近比较组"，然后将处理组的结果与这些接近比较组在治疗后的结果进行比较。该方法要求研究设计存在接近比较组或时间同质性

Result: 该方法在识别策略上具有稳健性，能够在多种不同的非嵌套面板数据识别策略下恢复平均处理效应，包括双重差分、变化中的变化、滞后结果无混淆性等

Conclusion: 虽然该方法对研究设计的要求更高（需要存在接近比较组或时间同质性），但当这些条件满足时，能够提供更可信的因果推断结果，且具有识别策略稳健性

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new approach to causal inference with panel data. Instead of using panel data to adjust for differences in the distribution of unobserved heterogeneity between the treated and comparison groups, we instead use panel data to search for "close comparison groups" -- groups that are similar to the treated group in terms of pre-treatment outcomes. Then, we compare the outcomes of the treated group to the outcomes of these close comparison groups in post-treatment periods. We show that this approach is often identification-strategy-robust in the sense that our approach recovers the ATT under many different non-nested panel data identification strategies, including difference-in-differences, change-in-changes, or lagged outcome unconfoundedness, among several others. We provide related, though non-nested, results under "time homogeneity", where outcomes do not systematically change over time for any comparison group. Our strategy asks more out of the research design -- namely that there exist close comparison groups or time homogeneity (neither of which is required for most existing panel data approaches to causal inference) -- but, when available, leads to more credible inferences.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在实际应用中，数据向量中的部分变量可能以完全任意且潜在内生的方式缺失。这种缺失使得传统广义矩方法不再适用，参数通常只能部分识别。需要开发能够处理这种复杂缺失模式的方法论框架。

Method: 1) 使用矩预测凸集的支撑函数来刻画部分识别参数的识别集；2) 提出该识别集的估计方法；3) 设计假设检验统计量；4) 指出标准非参数bootstrap可能无效，建议使用Fang和Santos(2019)的方向可微泛函bootstrap进行修正。

Conclusion: 本文为处理任意内生缺失数据的广义矩方法问题提供了一个完整的框架，包括识别、估计、推断和置信区域构造。提出的方法在实际应用中具有可行性，特别是在数据有界支撑的情况下表现良好。

Abstract: We consider a generalized method of moments framework in which a part of the data vector is missing for some units in a completely unrestricted, potentially endogenous way. In this setup, the parameters of interest are usually only partially identified. We characterize the identified set for such parameters using the support function of the convex set of moment predictions consistent with the data. This identified set is sharp, valid for both continuous and discrete data, and straightforward to estimate. We also propose a statistic for testing hypotheses and constructing confidence regions for the true parameter, show that standard nonparametric bootstrap may not be valid, and suggest a fix using the bootstrap for directionally differentiable functionals of Fang and Santos (2019). A set of Monte Carlo simulations demonstrates that both our estimator and the confidence region perform well when samples are moderately large and the data have bounded supports.

Abstract: This paper develops a general framework for identifying causal effects in settings with spillovers, where both outcomes and endogenous treatment decisions are influenced by peers within a known group. It introduces the generalized local average controlled spillover and direct effects (LACSEs and LACDEs), which extend the local average treatment effect framework to settings with spillovers and establish sufficient conditions for their point identification without restricting the cardinality of the support of instrumental variables. These conditions clarify the necessity of commonly imposed restrictions to achieve point identification with binary instruments in related studies. The paper then defines the marginal controlled spillover and direct effects (MCSEs and MCDEs), which naturally extend the marginal treatment effect framework to settings with spillovers and are nonparametrically point identified from continuous variation in instruments. These marginal effects serve as building blocks for a broad class of policy-relevant treatment effects, including some causal spillover parameters in the related literature. Semiparametric and parametric estimators are developed, and an application using Add Health data reveals heterogeneity in education spillovers within best-friend networks.

Conclusion: 新框架能更全面地评估断点回归设计中的政策效应，考虑了直接和间接效应，为政策评估提供了更准确的工具。

Abstract: We develop a new framework for evaluating the total policy effect in regression discontinuity designs (RDD), incorporating both the direct effect of treatment on outcomes and the indirect effect arising from distortions in the running variable when treatment becomes available. Our identification strategy combines a conditional parallel trend assumption to recover untreated potential outcomes with a local invariance assumption that characterizes how the running variable responds to counterfactual policy cutoffs. These components allow us to identify and estimate counterfactual treatment effects for any proposed threshold. We construct a nonparametric estimator for the total effect, derive its asymptotic distribution, and propose bootstrap inference procedures. Finally, we apply our framework to the Italian Domestic Stability Pact, where population-based fiscal rules generate both behavioral responses and running-variable distortions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究人员和电力行业从业者经常需要电力市场的供给曲线和供给价格弹性，用于价格预测、政策分析或市场力量评估。传统方法基于工程数据（如装机容量和燃料价格）构建供给曲线，但需要一种数据驱动方法直接从观测数据中经验估计供给曲线

Method: 提出数据驱动方法从观测价格和数量中经验估计电力市场供给曲线。由于欧洲能源危机期间燃料价格剧烈波动，核心任务是检测稳定供给曲线的时期。为此实现了两种聚类方法：一种基于电力供给的基本驱动因素，另一种直接基于观测的市场结果

Result: 将方法应用于2019-2024年德国电力市场，发现两种方法识别出几乎相同的制度转变，支持稳定供给制度源于稳定驱动因素的观点。供给条件通常长期稳定，但在能源危机期间迅速演变，引发了一系列快速制度转变。燃料价格是制度转变的主要驱动因素，而传统电厂可用性和核淘汰的作用相对较小

Conclusion: 该方法产生适用于因果推断和市场结果反事实分析的实证供给曲线，为电力市场分析提供了数据驱动的经验估计工具

Abstract: Researchers and electricity sector practitioners frequently require the supply curve of electricity markets and the price elasticity of supply for purposes such as price forecasting, policy analyses or market power assessment. It is common practice to construct supply curves from engineering data such as installed capacity and fuel prices. In this study, we propose a data-driven methodology to estimate the supply curve of electricity market empirically, i.e. from observed prices and quantities without further modeling assumptions. Due to the massive swings in fuel prices during the European energy crisis, a central task is detecting periods of stable supply curves. To this end, we implement two alternative clustering methods, one based on the fundamental drivers of electricity supply and the other directly on observed market outcomes. We apply our methods to the German electricity market between 2019 and 2024. We find that both approaches identify almost identical regimes shifts, supporting the idea of stable supply regimes stemming from stable drivers. Supply conditions are often stable for extended periods, but evolved rapidly during the energy crisis, triggering a rapid succession of regimes. Fuel prices were the dominant drivers of regime shifts, while conventional plant availability and the nuclear phase-out play a comparatively minor role. Our approach produces empirical supply curves suitable for causal inference and counterfactual analysis of market outcomes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有匹配模型通常依赖logit结构限制了异质性处理能力，需要更灵活的框架来处理任意异质性和相关模式。

Method: 采用线性规划公式化最优分配问题，引入迭代算法解决大规模分配问题，并开发了模拟矩匹配估计器来估计系统剩余。

Conclusion: 该框架为匹配问题提供了灵活且可扩展的解决方案，能够处理复杂的异质性和相关模式，超越了传统logit模型的限制。

Abstract: We present a general framework for matching with transferable utility (TU) that accommodates arbitrary heterogeneity without relying on the logit structure. The optimal assignment problem is characterized by tractable linear programming formulation, allowing flexible error distributions and correlation patterns. We introduce an iterative algorithm that solves large-scale assignment problems with guaranteed convergence and an intuitive economic interpretation, and we show how the same structure supports a simulated moment-matching estimator of the systematic surplus. Experiments using simulated data demonstrate the algorithm's scalability and the estimator's consistency under correct specification, as well as systematic bias arising from logit misspecification.

Method: 提出新的公理"局部一致性"，该公理将一致性条件应用于模型中任何对其禀赋最佳交换达成一致的代理人子集，基于此公理对Top Trading Cycles机制进行刻画

Abstract: In the housing market model introduced by Shapley and Scarf (1974), we propose a new axiom, local unanimity, that extends the unanimity condition widely used in social choice theory. It applies the unanimity condition to any subset of agents in the model who unanimously agree on the best exchange of their endowments. Building on this axiom, we provide several concise characterizations of the Top Trading Cycles (TTC) mechanism under both strict and weak preference domains.

Abstract: The ethic of proportional redistribution is a compromise between the extremely compensatory ethic of full redistribution and the needs-blind ethic of laissez-faire. In a basic model of redistribution problems with needs, we characterize proportional redistribution with a combination of axioms that formalize minimal requirements of accountability, functionality, and impartiality. Consequently, we provide a new ethical rationalization for the ancient Aristotelian maxim of proportionality.

Abstract: We study a continuous time contracting model in which a principal hires a risk averse agent to manage a project over a finite horizon and provides sequential payments whose timing is endogenously determined. The resulting nonzero-sum interaction between the principal and the agent is reformulated as a mixed control and stopping problem. Using numerical simulations, we investigate how factors such as the relative impatience of the parties and the number of bonus payments influence the principal's value and the structure of the optimal bonus payment scheme. A notable finding is that, in some contractual environments, the principal optimally offers a sign-on bonus to front-load incentives.

TL;DR: REMAP是一个执行感知的多智能体路径规划框架，通过ExecTimeNet准确估计执行时间，解决规划与执行之间的差距，在300个智能体的基准地图上比基线方法提升20%的解决方案质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MAPF方法假设简化的机器人模型，忽略了执行时的动力学约束、通信延迟和控制器变化等因素，导致规划与执行之间存在差距，这对时间敏感应用尤其成问题。

Method: 提出REMAP框架，结合ExecTimeNet准确估计执行时间，可与主流搜索式MAPF规划器（如MAPF-LNS和CBS）集成，只需少量修改即可解决具有实际截止时间的MAPF-RD问题。

Result: 实验表明，REMAP在最多300个智能体的基准地图上，相比基线方法（如恒定执行速度估计器）在解决方案质量上提升高达20%。

Conclusion: REMAP有效弥合了MAPF规划与执行之间的差距，通过准确估计执行时间，为时间敏感应用提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: The Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) problem aims to find collision-free paths for multiple agents while optimizing objectives such as the sum of costs or makespan. MAPF has wide applications in domains like automated warehouses, manufacturing systems, and airport logistics. However, most MAPF formulations assume a simplified robot model for planning, which overlooks execution-time factors such as kinodynamic constraints, communication latency, and controller variability. This gap between planning and execution is problematic for time-sensitive applications. To bridge this gap, we propose REMAP, an execution-informed MAPF planning framework that can be combined with leading search-based MAPF planners with minor changes. Our framework integrates the proposed ExecTimeNet to accurately estimate execution time based on planned paths. We demonstrate our method for solving MAPF with Real-world Deadlines (MAPF-RD) problem, where agents must reach their goals before a predefined wall-clock time. We integrate our framework with two popular MAPF methods, MAPF-LNS and CBS. Experiments show that REMAP achieves up to 20% improvement in solution quality over baseline methods (e.g., constant execution speed estimators) on benchmark maps with up to 300 agents.

Conclusion: OpenTwinMap为研究人员提供了一个灵活、可扩展的数字孪生生成框架，降低了适应和扩展到不同城市环境的门槛，有助于推进自动驾驶研究。

Abstract: Digital twins of urban environments play a critical role in advancing autonomous vehicle (AV) research by enabling simulation, validation, and integration with emerging generative world models. While existing tools have demonstrated value, many publicly available solutions are tightly coupled to specific simulators, difficult to extend, or introduce significant technical overhead. For example, CARLA-the most widely used open-source AV simulator-provides a digital twin framework implemented entirely as an Unreal Engine C++ plugin, limiting flexibility and rapid prototyping. In this work, we propose OpenTwinMap, an open-source, Python-based framework for generating high-fidelity 3D urban digital twins. The completed framework will ingest LiDAR scans and OpenStreetMap (OSM) data to produce semantically segmented static environment assets, including road networks, terrain, and urban structures, which can be exported into Unreal Engine for AV simulation. OpenTwinMap emphasizes extensibility and parallelization, lowering the barrier for researchers to adapt and scale the pipeline to diverse urban contexts. We describe the current capabilities of the OpenTwinMap, which includes preprocessing of OSM and LiDAR data, basic road mesh and terrain generation, and preliminary support for CARLA integration.

Conclusion: RSPECT算法能够有效解决无人机-地面车协同的鲁棒路径规划问题，在计算效率和鲁棒性之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: We consider the robust planning of energy-constrained unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs), which act as mobile charging stations, to perform long-horizon aerial monitoring missions. More specifically, given a set of points to be visited by the UAVs and desired final positions of the UAV-UGV teams, the objective is to find a robust plan (the vehicle trajectories) that can be realized without a major revision in the face of uncertainty (e.g., unknown obstacles/terrain, wind) to complete this mission in minimum time. We provide a formal description of this problem as a mixed-integer program (MIP), which is NP-hard. Since exact solution methods are computationally intractable for such problems, we propose RSPECT, a scalable and efficient heuristic. We provide theoretical results on the complexity of our algorithm and the feasibility and robustness of resulting plans. We also demonstrate the performance of our method via simulations and experiments.

Conclusion: 该方法建立了数字建模、实时传感和自适应成形的桥梁，推动了可持续、可定制化制造的下一代发展，为用户自定义设计提供了零浪费的成形途径。

Abstract: Additive and subtractive manufacturing enable complex geometries but rely on discrete stacking or local removal, limiting continuous and controllable deformation and causing volume loss and shape deviations. We present a volumepreserving digital-mold paradigm that integrates real-time volume-consistency modeling with geometry-informed deformation prediction and an error-compensation strategy to achieve highly predictable shaping of plastic materials. By analyzing deformation patterns and error trends from post-formed point clouds, our method corrects elastic rebound and accumulation errors, maintaining volume consistency and surface continuity. Experiments on five representative geometries demonstrate that the system reproduces target shapes with high fidelity while achieving over 98% material utilization. This approach establishes a digitally driven, reproducible pathway for sustainable, zero-waste shaping of user-defined designs, bridging digital modeling, real-time sensing, and adaptive forming, and advancing next-generation sustainable and customizable manufacturing.

Conclusion: 提出的统一实时导航框架通过在线构建自适应引导向量场，实现了四旋翼在未知复杂环境中的鲁棒闭环导航，显著提升了对外部扰动的适应性

Abstract: Although quadrotor navigation has achieved high performance in trajectory planning and control, real-time adaptability in unknown complex environments remains a core challenge. This difficulty mainly arises because most existing planning frameworks operate in an open-loop manner, making it hard to cope with environmental uncertainties such as wind disturbances or external perturbations. This paper presents a unified real-time navigation framework for quadrotors in unknown complex environments, based on the online construction of guiding vector fields (GVFs) from discrete reference path points. In the framework, onboard perception modules build a Euclidean Signed Distance Field (ESDF) representation of the environment, which enables obstacle awareness and path distance evaluation. The system first generates discrete, collision-free path points using a global planner, and then parameterizes them via uniform B-splines to produce a smooth and physically feasible reference trajectory. An adaptive GVF is then synthesized from the ESDF and the optimized B-spline trajectory. Unlike conventional approaches, the method adopts a closed-loop navigation paradigm, which significantly enhances robustness under external disturbances. Compared with conventional GVF methods, the proposed approach directly accommodates discretized paths and maintains compatibility with standard planning algorithms. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate improved robustness against external disturbances and superior real-time performance.

Motivation: 传统虚拟夹具在提升操作精度的同时会与用户产生"对抗"，增加心理负荷并削弱代理感，需要一种能平衡精度与用户体验的共享控制策略

Method: 基于博弈论的Soft-Nash共享控制策略，通过膨胀夹具努力权重的单一标量参数τ软化经典双玩家线性二次Nash解，从KL正则化信任区域和最大熵视角推导，获得封闭形式的机器人最佳响应

Result: 在6自由度触觉设备上的3D跟踪任务中，适度软化（τ≈1-3，特别是τ=2）保持跟踪误差与传统虚拟夹具统计无差异，同时显著减少控制器-用户冲突，降低NASA-TLX工作负荷，提高代理感

Conclusion: Soft-Nash策略通过单一参数在保持精度的同时改善舒适度和感知代理感，为触觉和遥操作中的个性化共享控制提供了实用且可解释的途径

Abstract: Virtual fixtures (VFs) improve precision in teleoperation but often ``fight'' the user, inflating mental workload and eroding the sense of agency. We propose Soft-Nash Virtual Fixtures, a game-theoretic shared-control policy that softens the classic two-player linear-quadratic (LQ) Nash solution by inflating the fixture's effort weight with a single, interpretable scalar parameter $τ$. This yields a continuous dial on controller assertiveness: $τ=0$ recovers a hard, performance-focused Nash / virtual fixture controller, while larger $τ$ reduce gains and pushback, yet preserve the equilibrium structure and continuity of closed-loop stability. We derive Soft-Nash from both a KL-regularized trust-region and a maximum-entropy viewpoint, obtaining a closed-form robot best response that shrinks authority and aligns the fixture with the operator's input as $τ$ grows. We implement Soft-Nash on a 6-DoF haptic device in 3D tracking task ($n=12$). Moderate softness ($τ\approx 1-3$, especially $τ=2$) maintains tracking error statistically indistinguishable from a tuned classic VF while sharply reducing controller-user conflict, lowering NASA-TLX workload, and increasing Sense of Agency (SoAS). A composite BalancedScore that combines normalized accuracy and non-fighting behavior peaks near $τ=2-3$. These results show that a one-parameter Soft-Nash policy can preserve accuracy while improving comfort and perceived agency, providing a practical and interpretable pathway to personalized shared control in haptics and teleoperation.

Abstract: Biological synergies have emerged as a widely adopted paradigm for dexterous hand design, enabling human-like manipulation with a small number of actuators. Nonetheless, excessive coupling tends to diminish the dexterity of hands. This paper tackles the trade-off between actuation complexity and dexterity by proposing an anthropomorphic finger topology with 4 DoFs driven by 2 actuators, and by developing an adaptive, modular dexterous hand based on this finger topology. We explore the biological basis of hand synergies and human gesture analysis, translating joint-level coordination and structural attributes into a modular finger architecture. Leveraging these biomimetic mappings, we design a five-finger modular hand and establish its kinematic model to analyze adaptive grasping and in-hand manipulation. Finally, we construct a physical prototype and conduct preliminary experiments, which validate the effectiveness of the proposed design and analysis.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for affordance-informed robotic manipulation by introducing 3D keypoints to enhance the understanding of object parts' functionality. The proposed approach provides direct information about what the potential use of objects is, as well as guidance on where and how a manipulator should engage, whereas conventional methods treat affordance detection as a semantic segmentation task, focusing solely on answering the what question. To address this gap, we propose a Fusion-based Affordance Keypoint Network (FAKP-Net) by introducing 3D keypoint quadruplet that harnesses the synergistic potential of RGB and Depth image to provide information on execution position, direction, and extent. Benchmark testing demonstrates that FAKP-Net outperforms existing models by significant margins in affordance segmentation task and keypoint detection task. Real-world experiments also showcase the reliability of our method in accomplishing manipulation tasks with previously unseen objects.

Abstract: Effective collective decision-making in swarm robotics often requires balancing exploration, communication and individual uncertainty estimation, especially in hazardous environments where direct measurements are limited or costly. We propose a decentralized Bayesian framework that enables a swarm of simple robots to identify the safer of two areas, each characterized by an unknown rate of hazardous events governed by a Poisson process. Robots employ a conjugate prior to gradually predict the times between events and derive confidence estimates to adapt their behavior. Our simulation results show that the robot swarm consistently chooses the correct area while reducing exposure to hazardous events by being sample-efficient. Compared to baseline heuristics, our proposed approach shows better performance in terms of safety and speed of convergence. The proposed scenario has potential to extend the current set of benchmarks in collective decision-making and our method has applications in adaptive risk-aware sampling and exploration in hazardous, dynamic environments.

Motivation: 现有ATC-DT方法在构建全局拓扑地图时，由于需要遍历所有节点进行最近邻搜索，随着地图规模增大会面临计算效率下降的问题，无法满足大规模动态环境中的实时性要求

Method: 提出多层ATC（MLATC）方法，将节点组织成层次结构，实现从粗到细的分辨率搜索；采用自适应层添加机制，在底层饱和时自动加深层次；无需预先固定层数，保持超参数数量较少

Result: 在合成大规模环境仿真实验中，MLATC相比原始ATC-DT加速了拓扑地图构建，搜索时间随节点数呈亚线性（近似对数）增长；在校园规模真实LiDAR数据集实验中，MLATC保持毫秒级每帧运行时间，实现大规模环境中的实时全局拓扑地图构建

Conclusion: MLATC通过分层结构显著提高了大规模环境下全局拓扑地图构建的计算效率，解决了ATC-DT的扩展性限制，实现了实时性能

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of building global topological maps from 3D LiDAR point clouds for autonomous mobile robots operating in large-scale, dynamic, and unknown environments. Adaptive Resonance Theory-based Topological Clustering with Different Topologies (ATC-DT) builds global topological maps represented as graphs while mitigating catastrophic forgetting during sequential processing. However, its winner selection mechanism relies on an exhaustive nearest-neighbor search over all existing nodes, leading to scalability limitations as the map grows. To address this challenge, we propose a hierarchical extension called Multi-Layer ATC (MLATC). MLATC organizes nodes into a hierarchy, enabling the nearest-neighbor search to proceed from coarse to fine resolutions, thereby drastically reducing the number of distance evaluations per query. The number of layers is not fixed in advance. MLATC employs an adaptive layer addition mechanism that automatically deepens the hierarchy when lower layers become saturated, keeping the number of user-defined hyperparameters low. Simulation experiments on synthetic large-scale environments show that MLATC accelerates topological map building compared to the original ATC-DT and exhibits a sublinear, approximately logarithmic scaling of search time with respect to the number of nodes. Experiments on campus-scale real-world LiDAR datasets confirm that MLATC maintains a millisecond-level per-frame runtime and enables real-time global topological map building in large-scale environments, significantly outperforming the original ATC-DT in terms of computational efficiency.

Abstract: Aiming to achieve both high functionality and flexibility in soft robot system, this paper presents a soft urethane sheet-like valve with an amplifier that can perform logical operations using only pneumatic signals. When the control chamber in the valve is pressurized, the main path is compressed along its central axis, buckling and being pressed,resulting in blockage. This allows control by a pressure signal smaller than that within the main channel. Furthermore, similar to transistors in electrical circuits, when combined, the proposed valve can perform a variety of logical operations. The basic type operates as a NOT logic element, which is named the fluidic sheet transistor (FST). By integrating multiple FSTs, logical operations such as positive logic, NAND, and NOR can be performed on a single sheet. This paper describes the operating principle, fabrication method, and characteristics of the FST,followed by a method for configuring logical operations.Moreover, we demonstrate the construction of a latch circuit(self-holding logic circuit) using FST, introducing a prototype of a fluid robot system that combines a tactile tube as a fluidic detector and fluid actuators. This demonstrates that it is possible to generate behavior that actively changes posture when hitting an obstacle using only air pressure from a single pipe, which verifies the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

Method: 1. 构建生成器，采样与阿克曼运动学兼容的多阶段前进-后退轨迹，并膨胀其包络以合成保证至少有一个可行逃逸路径的狭窄死胡同族；2. 构建强制执行运动学约束的训练环境，使用软演员-评论家算法训练策略；3. 与结合全局搜索和非完整转向的代表性传统规划器进行评估比较。

Result: 在参数化的死胡同族中，学习到的策略解决了更大比例的实例，减少了机动次数，在相同感知和控制限制下保持了可比较的路径长度和规划时间。

Conclusion: 基于深度强化学习的非完整狭窄死胡同逃逸策略优于传统规划方法，在解决率、机动效率等方面表现更好，项目已开源。

Abstract: Nonholonomic constraints restrict feasible velocities without reducing configuration-space dimension, which makes collision-free geometric paths generally non-executable for car-like robots. Ackermann steering further imposes curvature bounds and forbids in-place rotation, so escaping from narrow dead ends typically requires tightly sequenced forward and reverse maneuvers. Classical planners that decouple global search and local steering struggle in these settings because narrow passages occupy low-measure regions and nonholonomic reachability shrinks the set of valid connections, which degrades sampling efficiency and increases sensitivity to clearances. We study nonholonomic narrow dead-end escape for Ackermann vehicles and contribute three components. First, we construct a generator that samples multi-phase forward-reverse trajectories compatible with Ackermann kinematics and inflates their envelopes to synthesize families of narrow dead ends that are guaranteed to admit at least one feasible escape. Second, we construct a training environment that enforces kinematic constraints and train a policy using the soft actor-critic algorithm. Third, we evaluate against representative classical planners that combine global search with nonholonomic steering. Across parameterized dead-end families, the learned policy solves a larger fraction of instances, reduces maneuver count, and maintains comparable path length and planning time while under the same sensing and control limits.

TL;DR: CoMuRoS是一个分层架构，结合集中式规划和分布式执行，支持事件驱动的重规划，实现异构机器人团队的鲁棒协作和人机协作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM驱动的多机器人系统缺乏运行时事件驱动的重规划能力，无法在物理机器人上实现灵活、鲁棒的协作和人机交互。

Method: 分层架构：任务管理器LLM解析自然语言目标、分类任务、分配子任务；每个机器人运行本地LLM将原始技能组合成可执行Python代码；机载感知持续监控事件并分类；任务失败或用户意图变化触发重规划。

Result: 硬件实验：自主恢复成功率9/10，协调运输8/8，人机协助恢复5/5；仿真展示意图感知重规划；基准测试：22个场景平均正确率最高0.91，重规划场景正确率1.0。

Conclusion: CoMuRoS首次在物理机器人上实现运行时事件驱动的重规划，提供鲁棒、灵活的多机器人与人机协作，优于现有LLM系统。

Abstract: This paper introduces CoMuRoS (Collaborative Multi-Robot System), a generalizable hierarchical architecture for heterogeneous robot teams that unifies centralized deliberation with decentralized execution, and supports event-driven replanning. A Task Manager LLM interprets natural-language goals, classifies tasks, and allocates subtasks using static rules plus dynamic contexts (task, history, robot and task status, and events).Each robot runs a local LLM that composes executable Python code from primitive skills (ROS2 nodes, policies), while onboard perception (VLMs/image processing) continuously monitors events and classifies them into relevant or irrelevant to the task. Task failures or user intent changes trigger replanning, allowing robots to assist teammates, resume tasks, or request human help. Hardware studies demonstrate autonomous recovery from disruptive events, filtering of irrelevant distractions, and tightly coordinated transport with emergent human-robot cooperation (e.g., multirobot collaborative object recovery success rate: 9/10, coordinated transport: 8/8, human-assisted recovery: 5/5).Simulation studies show intention-aware replanning. A curated textual benchmark spanning 22 scenarios (3 tasks each, around 20 robots) evaluates task allocation, classification, IoU, executability, and correctness, with high average scores (e.g., correctness up to 0.91) across multiple LLMs, a separate replanning set (5 scenarios) achieves 1.0 correctness. Compared with prior LLM-based systems, CoMuRoS uniquely demonstrates runtime, event-driven replanning on physical robots, delivering robust, flexible multi-robot and human-robot collaboration.

TL;DR: BINDER是一个双过程框架，通过分离战略规划和连续环境监控来解决开放词汇移动操作中的动态环境适应问题，显著提高了成功率和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开放词汇移动操作方法只在离散点更新世界表示（如导航目标、路径点或动作结束时），导致机器人更新间"失明"，引发级联失败：遗漏对象、延迟错误检测和延迟重规划。

Method: 提出BINDER框架，包含两个互补模块：Deliberative Response Module（多模态LLM用于任务规划）和Instant Response Module（VideoLLM用于连续监控）。DRM进行战略规划并指导IRM关注点，IRM分析视频流更新记忆、纠正正在进行的动作并在必要时触发重规划。

Result: 在三个真实世界动态对象放置环境中评估，BINDER相比现有最先进方法实现了显著更高的成功率和效率，展示了其在实际部署中的有效性。

Conclusion: BINDER通过双过程框架解决了保持环境感知与避免昂贵更新之间的权衡，实现了动态条件下的鲁棒适应，为开放词汇移动操作的实际部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary mobile manipulation (OVMM) requires robots to follow language instructions, navigate, and manipulate while updating their world representation under dynamic environmental changes. However, most prior approaches update their world representation only at discrete update points such as navigation targets, waypoints, or the end of an action step, leaving robots blind between updates and causing cascading failures: overlooked objects, late error detection, and delayed replanning. To address this limitation, we propose BINDER (Bridging INstant and DEliberative Reasoning), a dual process framework that decouples strategic planning from continuous environment monitoring. Specifically, BINDER integrates a Deliberative Response Module (DRM, a multimodal LLM for task planning) with an Instant Response Module (IRM, a VideoLLM for continuous monitoring). The two modules play complementary roles: the DRM performs strategic planning with structured 3D scene updates and guides what the IRM attends to, while the IRM analyzes video streams to update memory, correct ongoing actions, and trigger replanning when necessary. Through this bidirectional coordination, the modules address the trade off between maintaining awareness and avoiding costly updates, enabling robust adaptation under dynamic conditions. Evaluated in three real world environments with dynamic object placement, BINDER achieves substantially higher success and efficiency than SoTA baselines, demonstrating its effectiveness for real world deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模仿学习方法在空间和视觉随机化下泛化能力不足，容易过拟合，需要设计更有效的观察编码器来提升策略泛化能力。

Method: 提出视觉几何扩散策略(VGDP)，包含互补感知融合模块，通过模态级dropout强制平衡使用RGB和点云线索，交叉注意力仅作为轻量级交互层。

Result: 在18个模拟任务和4个真实任务中，VGDP平均性能提升39.1%，在视觉扰动下平均提升41.5%，在空间设置下平均提升15.2%，优于7个基线策略。

Conclusion: 融合潜在空间的表达能力主要来自模态级dropout强制的互补性，交叉注意力主要作为轻量级交互机制而非鲁棒性的主要来源，VGDP在视觉和空间扰动下表现出强鲁棒性。

Abstract: Imitation learning has emerged as a crucial ap proach for acquiring visuomotor skills from demonstrations, where designing effective observation encoders is essential for policy generalization. However, existing methods often struggle to generalize under spatial and visual randomizations, instead tending to overfit. To address this challenge, we propose Visual Geometry Diffusion Policy (VGDP), a multimodal imitation learning framework built around a Complementarity-Aware Fusion Module where modality-wise dropout enforces balanced use of RGB and point-cloud cues, with cross-attention serving only as a lightweight interaction layer. Our experiments show that the expressiveness of the fused latent space is largely induced by the enforced complementarity from modality-wise dropout, with cross-attention serving primarily as a lightweight interaction mechanism rather than the main source of robustness. Across a benchmark of 18 simulated tasks and 4 real-world tasks, VGDP outperforms seven baseline policies with an average performance improvement of 39.1%. More importantly, VGDP demonstrates strong robustness under visual and spatial per turbations, surpassing baselines with an average improvement of 41.5% in different visual conditions and 15.2% in different spatial settings.

Method: 提出clean-to-noisy范式，使用RealD²iff层次化扩散框架，将深度噪声分解为全局结构失真和局部扰动。采用频率引导监督(FGS)进行全局建模和差异引导优化(DGO)进行局部细化，构建六阶段模仿学习流程。

Conclusion: 通过扩散模型学习合成噪声深度是弥合视觉sim2real差距的有效方法，RealD²iff框架能够实现零样本机器人操作，为模拟驱动的机器人学习提供了新范式。

Abstract: Robot manipulation in the real world is fundamentally constrained by the visual sim2real gap, where depth observations collected in simulation fail to reflect the complex noise patterns inherent to real sensors. In this work, inspired by the denoising capability of diffusion models, we invert the conventional perspective and propose a clean-to-noisy paradigm that learns to synthesize noisy depth, thereby bridging the visual sim2real gap through purely simulation-driven robotic learning. Building on this idea, we introduce RealD$^2$iff, a hierarchical coarse-to-fine diffusion framework that decomposes depth noise into global structural distortions and fine-grained local perturbations. To enable progressive learning of these components, we further develop two complementary strategies: Frequency-Guided Supervision (FGS) for global structure modeling and Discrepancy-Guided Optimization (DGO) for localized refinement. To integrate RealD$^2$iff seamlessly into imitation learning, we construct a pipeline that spans six stages. We provide comprehensive empirical and experimental validation demonstrating the effectiveness of this paradigm. RealD$^2$iff enables two key applications: (1) generating real-world-like depth to construct clean-noisy paired datasets without manual sensor data collection. (2) Achieving zero-shot sim2real robot manipulation, substantially improving real-world performance without additional fine-tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLA模型在机器人操作中表现出执行质量不稳定，这源于人类演示数据的质量参差不齐，其中隐含的任务约束仅被部分满足

Method: 1) 定义优雅执行为满足隐式任务约束；2) 通过离线校准Q学习训练优雅批评器评估动作质量；3) 推理时使用即时干预机制，仅在决策关键点进行选择性干预

Result: 在LIBERO-Elegant基准和真实世界操作任务上，优雅批评器显著提升了执行质量，即使在未见任务上也能有效工作

Conclusion: 该框架实现了不仅关注任务是否成功，更关注如何执行的机器人控制，为提升VLA模型执行质量提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have enabled notable progress in general-purpose robotic manipulation, yet their learned policies often exhibit variable execution quality. We attribute this variability to the mixed-quality nature of human demonstrations, where the implicit principles that govern how actions should be carried out are only partially satisfied. To address this challenge, we introduce the LIBERO-Elegant benchmark with explicit criteria for evaluating execution quality. Using these criteria, we develop a decoupled refinement framework that improves execution quality without modifying or retraining the base VLA policy. We formalize Elegant Execution as the satisfaction of Implicit Task Constraints (ITCs) and train an Elegance Critic via offline Calibrated Q-Learning to estimate the expected quality of candidate actions. At inference time, a Just-in-Time Intervention (JITI) mechanism monitors critic confidence and intervenes only at decision-critical moments, providing selective, on-demand refinement. Experiments on LIBERO-Elegant and real-world manipulation tasks show that the learned Elegance Critic substantially improves execution quality, even on unseen tasks. The proposed model enables robotic control that values not only whether tasks succeed, but also how they are performed.

Conclusion: 将反应式RL导航与选择性MAPF干预相结合，能够产生鲁棒的零样本性能，有效解决多机器人导航中的拓扑死锁问题

Abstract: Multi-robot navigation in cluttered environments presents fundamental challenges in balancing reactive collision avoidance with long-range goal achievement. When navigating through narrow passages
  or confined spaces, deadlocks frequently emerge that prevent agents from reaching their destinations, particularly when Reinforcement Learning (RL) control policies encounter novel configurations out of learning distribution. Existing RL-based approaches suffer from limited generalization capability in unseen environments. We propose a hybrid framework that seamlessly integrates RL-based reactive navigation with on-demand Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) to explicitly resolve topological deadlocks. Our approach integrates a safety layer that monitors agent progress to detect deadlocks and, when detected, triggers a coordination controller for affected agents. The framework constructs globally feasible trajectories via MAPF and regulates waypoint progression to reduce inter-agent conflicts during navigation.
  Extensive evaluation on dense multi-agent benchmarks shows that our method boosts task completion from marginal to near-universal success, markedly reducing deadlocks and collisions. When integrated with hierarchical task planning, it enables coordinated navigation for heterogeneous robots, demonstrating that coupling reactive RL navigation with selective MAPF intervention yields a robust, zero-shot performance.

Conclusion: 通过基于机制可解释性的稀疏微调方法，Robotic Steering为视觉语言动作模型适应多样化机器人任务提供了一种更有效、更高效、更具可解释性的解决方案

Abstract: Vision-Language Action (VLAs) models promise to extend the remarkable success of vision-language models (VLMs) to robotics. Yet, unlike VLMs in the vision-language domain, VLAs for robotics require finetuning to contend with varying physical factors like robot embodiment, environment characteristics, and spatial relationships of each task. Existing fine-tuning methods lack specificity, adapting the same set of parameters regardless of a task's visual, linguistic, and physical characteristics. Inspired by functional specificity in neuroscience, we hypothesize that it is more effective to finetune sparse model representations specific to a given task. In this work, we introduce Robotic Steering, a finetuning approach grounded in mechanistic interpretability that leverages few-shot demonstrations to identify and selectively finetune task-specific attention heads aligned with the physical, visual, and linguistic requirements of robotic tasks. Through comprehensive on-robot evaluations with a Franka Emika robot arm, we demonstrate that Robotic Steering outperforms LoRA while achieving superior robustness under task variation, reduced computational cost, and enhanced interpretability for adapting VLAs to diverse robotic tasks.

Abstract: The ability to accomplish a sit-to-stand (STS) motion is key to increase functional mobility and reduce rehospitalization risks. While raising aid (transfer) devices and partial bodyweight support (rehabilitation) devices exist, both are unable to adjust the STS training to different mobility levels. Therefore, We have developed an STS training device that allows various configurations of impedance and vertical/forward forces to adapt to many training needs while maintaining commercial raising aid transfer capabilities. Experiments with healthy adults (both men and women) of various heights and weights show that the device 1) has a low impact on the natural STS kinematics, 2) can provide precise weight unloading at the patient's center of mass and 3) can add a forward virtual spring to assist the transfer of the bodyweight to the feet for seat-off, at the start of the STS motion.

Abstract: Recent progress in legged locomotion has allowed highly dynamic and parkour-like behaviors for robots, similar to their biological counterparts. Yet, these methods mostly rely on egocentric (first-person) perception, limiting their performance, especially when the viewpoint of the robot is occluded. A promising solution would be to enhance the robot's environmental awareness by using complementary viewpoints, such as multiple actors exchanging perceptual information. Inspired by this idea, this work proposes a multi-view depth-based locomotion framework that combines egocentric and exocentric observations to provide richer environmental context during agile locomotion. Using a teacher-student distillation approach, the student policy learns to fuse proprioception with dual depth streams while remaining robust to real-world sensing imperfections. To further improve robustness, we introduce extensive domain randomization, including stochastic remote-camera dropouts and 3D positional perturbations that emulate aerial-ground cooperative sensing. Simulation results show that multi-viewpoints policies outperform single-viewpoint baseline in gap crossing, step descent, and other dynamic maneuvers, while maintaining stability when the exocentric camera is partially or completely unavailable. Additional experiments show that moderate viewpoint misalignment is well tolerated when incorporated during training. This study demonstrates that heterogeneous visual feedback improves robustness and agility in quadrupedal locomotion. Furthermore, to support reproducibility, the implementation accompanying this work is publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/multiview-parkour-6FB8

Motivation: 传统扩散模型在模仿学习中需要大规模数据集才能获得最优性能，但对于避障等复杂任务，获取覆盖各种障碍物类型和空间配置的数据成本高昂且不切实际。

Method: 提出CAPE框架，通过先验种子迭代引导精炼过程：首先生成初始轨迹计划并执行短前缀轨迹，然后将剩余轨迹段扰动到中间噪声水平形成上下文感知的先验，再通过上下文感知引导去噪迭代扩展模式支持，寻找更平滑、碰撞更少的轨迹。

Result: 在杂乱未见模拟和真实世界环境中评估CAPE，相比SOTA方法分别实现了高达26%和80%的更高成功率，展示了在未见环境中更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: CAPE通过上下文感知的先验和引导机制，有效扩展了轨迹分布模式，能够在未见环境中采样无碰撞轨迹同时保持目标一致性，为解决数据稀缺环境中的模仿学习问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: In robotics, diffusion models can capture multi-modal trajectories from demonstrations, making them a transformative approach in imitation learning. However, achieving optimal performance following this regiment requires a large-scale dataset, which is costly to obtain, especially for challenging tasks, such as collision avoidance. In those tasks, generalization at test time demands coverage of many obstacles types and their spatial configurations, which are impractical to acquire purely via data. To remedy this problem, we propose Context-Aware diffusion policy via Proximal mode Expansion (CAPE), a framework that expands trajectory distribution modes with context-aware prior and guidance at inference via a novel prior-seeded iterative guided refinement procedure. The framework generates an initial trajectory plan and executes a short prefix trajectory, and then the remaining trajectory segment is perturbed to an intermediate noise level, forming a trajectory prior. Such a prior is context-aware and preserves task intent. Repeating the process with context-aware guided denoising iteratively expands mode support to allow finding smoother, less collision-prone trajectories. For collision avoidance, CAPE expands trajectory distribution modes with collision-aware context, enabling the sampling of collision-free trajectories in previously unseen environments while maintaining goal consistency. We evaluate CAPE on diverse manipulation tasks in cluttered unseen simulated and real-world settings and show up to 26% and 80% higher success rates respectively compared to SOTA methods, demonstrating better generalization to unseen environments.

Abstract: Learning robust visuomotor policies for robotic manipulation remains a challenge in real-world settings, where visual distractors can significantly degrade performance and safety. In this work, we propose an effective and scalable framework, Naturalistic Inpainting for Context Enhancement (NICE). Our method minimizes out-of-distribution (OOD) gap in imitation learning by increasing visual diversity through construction of new experiences using existing demonstrations. By utilizing image generative frameworks and large language models, NICE performs three editing operations, object replacement, restyling, and removal of distracting (non-target) objects. These changes preserve spatial relationships without obstructing target objects and maintain action-label consistency. Unlike previous approaches, NICE requires no additional robot data collection, simulator access, or custom model training, making it readily applicable to existing robotic datasets.
  Using real-world scenes, we showcase the capability of our framework in producing photo-realistic scene enhancement. For downstream tasks, we use NICE data to finetune a vision-language model (VLM) for spatial affordance prediction and a vision-language-action (VLA) policy for object manipulation. Our evaluations show that NICE successfully minimizes OOD gaps, resulting in over 20% improvement in accuracy for affordance prediction in highly cluttered scenes. For manipulation tasks, success rate increases on average by 11% when testing in environments populated with distractors in different quantities. Furthermore, we show that our method improves visual robustness, lowering target confusion by 6%, and enhances safety by reducing collision rate by 7%.

Motivation: 现有研究缺乏从心理物理学角度评估机器人操作策略在杂乱场景中的性能，需要一种统一的度量标准来综合考虑环境因素、干扰物数量、特征和排列方式。

Method: 提出统一的杂乱度量标准，在超真实模拟和现实世界中系统构建评估场景，对视觉-语言-动作模型进行广泛实验，分析杂乱对性能的影响。

Abstract: In this work, we propose an evaluation protocol for examining the performance of robotic manipulation policies in cluttered scenes. Contrary to prior works, we approach evaluation from a psychophysical perspective, therefore we use a unified measure of clutter that accounts for environmental factors as well as the distractors quantity, characteristics, and arrangement. Using this measure, we systematically construct evaluation scenarios in both hyper-realistic simulation and real-world and conduct extensive experimentation on manipulation policies, in particular vision-language-action (VLA) models. Our experiments highlight the significant impact of scene clutter, lowering the performance of the policies, by as much as 34% and show that despite achieving similar average performance across the tasks, different VLA policies have unique vulnerabilities and a relatively low agreement on success scenarios. We further show that our clutter measure is an effective indicator of performance degradation and analyze the impact of distractors in terms of their quantity and occluding influence. At the end, we show that finetuning on enhanced data, although effective, does not equally remedy all negative impacts of clutter on performance.

TL;DR: 提出一种集成风险感知规划与保证碰撞避免的轨迹规划框架，用于复杂驾驶场景（如自主变道），通过动态风险场、时变凸可行空间和约束iLQR求解器实现安全高效的轨迹生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对复杂驾驶场景（如自主变道）中传统方法难以同时保证安全性、效率和舒适性的问题，需要一种能综合考虑动态风险、运动学可行性和严格安全约束的统一规划框架。

Method: 1) 构建动态风险场(DRF)捕捉静态和动态碰撞风险；2) 生成时变凸可行空间保证运动学可行性和安全要求；3) 将轨迹规划问题建模为有限时域最优控制问题，使用约束迭代线性二次调节器(iLQR)算法联合优化轨迹平滑性、控制努力和风险暴露。

Result: 在模拟中优于传统方法：变道距离更短(28.59 m)、时间更短(2.84 s)，保持平滑舒适的加速度模式；在密集环岛环境中表现出更强的鲁棒适应性，相比APF、MPC和RRT基线方法具有更大的安全裕度、更低急动度和更优曲率平滑性。

Conclusion: 集成DRF、凸可行空间和约束iLQR求解器的方法为动态交互交通场景提供了安全、高效且舒适的轨迹生成平衡解决方案，在复杂驾驶场景中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel trajectory planning pipeline for complex driving scenarios like autonomous lane changing, by integrating risk-aware planning with guaranteed collision avoidance into a unified optimization framework. We first construct a dynamic risk fields (DRF) that captures both the static and dynamic collision risks from surrounding vehicles. Then, we develop a rigorous strategy for generating time-varying convex feasible spaces that ensure kinematic feasibility and safety requirements. The trajectory planning problem is formulated as a finite-horizon optimal control problem and solved using a constrained iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator (iLQR) algorithm that jointly optimizes trajectory smoothness, control effort, and risk exposure while maintaining strict feasibility. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our method outperforms traditional approaches in terms of safety and efficiency, achieving collision-free trajectories with shorter lane-changing distances (28.59 m) and times (2.84 s) while maintaining smooth and comfortable acceleration patterns. In dense roundabout environments the planner further demonstrates robust adaptability, producing larger safety margins, lower jerk, and superior curvature smoothness compared with APF, MPC, and RRT based baselines. These results confirm that the integrated DRF with convex feasible space and constrained iLQR solver provides a balanced solution for safe, efficient, and comfortable trajectory generation in dynamic and interactive traffic scenarios.

Abstract: Uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) performing tasks such as transportation and aerial photography are vulnerable to intentional projectile attacks from humans. Dodging such a sudden and fast projectile poses a significant challenge for UAVs, requiring ultra-low latency responses and agile maneuvers. Drawing inspiration from baseball, in which pitchers' body movements are analyzed to predict the ball's trajectory, we propose a novel real-time dodging system that leverages an RGB-D camera. Our approach integrates human pose estimation with depth information to predict the attacker's motion trajectory and the subsequent projectile trajectory. Additionally, we introduce an uncertainty-aware dodging strategy to enable the UAV to dodge incoming projectiles efficiently. Our perception system achieves high prediction accuracy and outperforms the baseline in effective distance and latency. The dodging strategy addresses temporal and spatial uncertainties to ensure UAV safety. Extensive real-world experiments demonstrate the framework's reliable dodging capabilities against sudden attacks and its outstanding robustness across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Underwater visual localization remains challenging due to wavelength-dependent attenuation, poor texture, and non-Gaussian sensor noise. We introduce MARVO, a physics-aware, learning-integrated odometry framework that fuses underwater image formation modeling, differentiable matching, and reinforcement-learning optimization. At the front-end, we extend transformer-based feature matcher with a Physics Aware Radiance Adapter that compensates for color channel attenuation and contrast loss, yielding geometrically consistent feature correspondences under turbidity. These semi dense matches are combined with inertial and pressure measurements inside a factor-graph backend, where we formulate a keyframe-based visual-inertial-barometric estimator using GTSAM library. Each keyframe introduces (i) Pre-integrated IMU motion factors, (ii) MARVO-derived visual pose factors, and (iii) barometric depth priors, giving a full-state MAP estimate in real time. Lastly, we introduce a Reinforcement-Learningbased Pose-Graph Optimizer that refines global trajectories beyond local minima of classical least-squares solvers by learning optimal retraction actions on SE(2).

Abstract: End-to-End (E2E) planning has become a powerful paradigm for autonomous driving, yet current systems remain fundamentally uncertainty-blind. They assume perception outputs are fully reliable, even in ambiguous or poorly observed scenes, leaving the planner without an explicit measure of uncertainty. To address this limitation, we propose a camera-only E2E framework that estimates aleatoric uncertainty directly in BEV space and incorporates it into planning. Our method produces a dense, uncertainty-aware drivability map that captures both semantic structure and geometric layout at pixel-level resolution. To further promote safe and rule-compliant behavior, we introduce a lane-following regularization that encodes lane structure and traffic norms. This prior stabilizes trajectory planning under normal conditions while preserving the flexibility needed for maneuvers such as overtaking or lane changes. Together, these components enable robust and interpretable trajectory planning, even under challenging uncertainty conditions. Evaluated on the NAVSIM benchmark, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering substantial gains on both the challenging NAVHARD and NAVSAFE subsets. These results demonstrate that our principled aleatoric uncertainty modeling combined with driving priors significantly advances the safety and reliability of camera-only E2E autonomous driving.

Abstract: Ensuring safety remains a key challenge for autonomous vehicles (AVs), especially in rare and complex scenarios. One critical but understudied aspect is the \textbf{potential risk} situations, where the risk is \textbf{not yet observable} but can be inferred from subtle precursors, such as anomalous behaviors or commonsense violations. Recognizing these precursors requires strong semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities, which are often absent in current AV systems due to the scarcity of such cases in existing driving or risk-centric datasets. Moreover, current autonomous driving accident datasets often lack annotations of the causal reasoning chains behind incidents, which are essential for identifying potential risks before they become observable. To address these gaps, we introduce PotentialRiskQA, a novel vision-language dataset designed for reasoning about potential risks prior to observation. Each sample is annotated with structured scene descriptions, semantic precursors, and inferred risk outcomes. Based on this dataset, we further propose PR-Reasoner, a vision-language-model-based framework tailored for onboard potential risk reasoning. Experimental results show that fine-tuning on PotentialRiskQA enables PR-Reasoner to significantly enhance its performance on the potential risk reasoning task compared to baseline VLMs. Together, our dataset and model provide a foundation for developing autonomous systems with improved foresight and proactive safety capabilities, moving toward more intelligent and resilient AVs.

Abstract: Enabling humanoid robots to follow free-form language commands is critical for seamless human-robot interaction, collaborative task execution, and general-purpose embodied intelligence. While recent advances have improved low-level humanoid locomotion and robot manipulation, language-conditioned whole-body control remains a significant challenge. Existing methods are often limited to simple instructions and sacrifice either motion diversity or physical plausibility. To address this, we introduce Humanoid-LLA, a Large Language Action Model that maps expressive language commands to physically executable whole-body actions for humanoid robots. Our approach integrates three core components: a unified motion vocabulary that aligns human and humanoid motion primitives into a shared discrete space; a vocabulary-directed controller distilled from a privileged policy to ensure physical feasibility; and a physics-informed fine-tuning stage using reinforcement learning with dynamics-aware rewards to enhance robustness and stability. Extensive evaluations in simulation and on a real-world Unitree G1 humanoid show that Humanoid-LLA delivers strong language generalization while maintaining high physical fidelity, outperforming existing language-conditioned controllers in motion naturalness, stability, and execution success rate.

Motivation: GNSS受限环境（如城市峡谷）中的可靠定位是导航系统的关键挑战。传统的紧耦合GNSS/IMU融合虽然提高了鲁棒性，但仍易受非高斯噪声和异常值影响，需要更强大的鲁棒性解决方案。

Method: 提出基于因子图的鲁棒自适应融合框架：1）直接集成GNSS伪距测量与IMU预积分因子；2）引入Barron损失函数（统一多种M估计器的通用鲁棒损失函数），通过可调参数自适应降低不可靠GNSS测量的权重；3）在扩展的GTSAM框架中实现。

Conclusion: Barron损失函数能显著提升GNSS/IMU融合导航在GNSS受限环境中的鲁棒性，自适应抑制不可靠测量，为城市峡谷等信号受损环境提供了有效的定位解决方案。

Abstract: Reliable positioning in GNSS-challenged environments remains a critical challenge for navigation systems. Tightly coupled GNSS/IMU fusion improves robustness but remains vulnerable to non-Gaussian noise and outliers. We present a robust and adaptive factor graph-based fusion framework that directly integrates GNSS pseudorange measurements with IMU preintegration factors and incorporates the Barron loss, a general robust loss function that unifies several m-estimators through a single tunable parameter. By adaptively down weighting unreliable GNSS measurements, our approach improves resilience positioning. The method is implemented in an extended GTSAM framework and evaluated on the UrbanNav dataset. The proposed solution reduces positioning errors by up to 41% relative to standard FGO, and achieves even larger improvements over extended Kalman filter (EKF) baselines in urban canyon environments. These results highlight the benefits of Barron loss in enhancing the resilience of GNSS/IMU-based navigation in urban and signal-compromised environments.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have demonstrated impressive results for novel view synthesis with real-time rendering capabilities. However, integrating 3DGS with SLAM systems faces a fundamental scalability limitation: methods are constrained by GPU memory capacity, restricting reconstruction to small-scale environments. We present DiskChunGS, a scalable 3DGS SLAM system that overcomes this bottleneck through an out-of-core approach that partitions scenes into spatial chunks and maintains only active regions in GPU memory while storing inactive areas on disk. Our architecture integrates seamlessly with existing SLAM frameworks for pose estimation and loop closure, enabling globally consistent reconstruction at scale. We validate DiskChunGS on indoor scenes (Replica, TUM-RGBD), urban driving scenarios (KITTI), and resource-constrained Nvidia Jetson platforms. Our method uniquely completes all 11 KITTI sequences without memory failures while achieving superior visual quality, demonstrating that algorithmic innovation can overcome the memory constraints that have limited previous 3DGS SLAM methods.

Conclusion: 通过结合动作预测来捕获物理先验（如真实距离和方向），实现了潜在动作的通用性和可转移性，显著提升了机器人操作的泛化性能

Abstract: Learning transferable latent actions from large-scale object manipulation videos can significantly enhance generalization in downstream robotics tasks, as such representations are agnostic to different robot embodiments. Existing approaches primarily rely on visual reconstruction objectives while neglecting physical priors, leading to sub-optimal performance in learning universal representations. To address these challenges, we propose a Universal Latent Action Learning framework that takes task instructions and multiple frames as inputs, and optimizes both future frame reconstruction and action sequence prediction. Unlike prior works, incorporating action predictions (e.g., gripper or hand trajectories and orientations) allows the model to capture richer physical priors such as real-world distances and orientations, thereby enabling seamless transferability to downstream tasks. We further decompose the latent actions into learnable motion and scene tokens to distinguish the robot's active movements from environmental changes, thus filtering out irrelevant dynamics. By distilling the learned latent actions into the latest VLA models, we achieve strong performance across both simulated (SIMPLER and LIBERO) and real-world robot settings. Notably, with only 10 real-world trajectories per task collected on a Franka robot, our approach successfully completes all five challenging tasks, demonstrating strong few-shot transferability in robotic manipulation.

Abstract: We present a novel framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with automated planning and formal verification to streamline the creation and use of Markov Decision Processes (MDP). Our system leverages LLMs to extract structured knowledge in the form of a Prolog knowledge base from natural language (NL) descriptions. It then automatically constructs an MDP through reachability analysis, and synthesises optimal policies using the Storm model checker. The resulting policy is exported as a state-action table for execution. We validate the framework in three human-robot interaction scenarios, demonstrating its ability to produce executable policies with minimal manual effort. This work highlights the potential of combining language models with formal methods to enable more accessible and scalable probabilistic planning in robotics.

Abstract: Successful robotic grasping in cluttered environments not only requires a model to visually ground a target object but also to reason about obstructions that must be cleared beforehand. While current vision-language embodied reasoning models show emergent spatial understanding, they remain limited in terms of obstruction reasoning and accessibility planning. To bridge this gap, we present UNOGrasp, a learning-based vision-language model capable of performing visually-grounded obstruction reasoning to infer the sequence of actions needed to unobstruct the path and grasp the target object. We devise a novel multi-step reasoning process based on obstruction paths originated by the target object. We anchor each reasoning step with obstruction-aware visual cues to incentivize reasoning capability. UNOGrasp combines supervised and reinforcement finetuning through verifiable reasoning rewards. Moreover, we construct UNOBench, a large-scale dataset for both training and benchmarking, based on MetaGraspNetV2, with over 100k obstruction paths annotated by humans with obstruction ratios, contact points, and natural-language instructions. Extensive experiments and real-robot evaluations show that UNOGrasp significantly improves obstruction reasoning and grasp success across both synthetic and real-world environments, outperforming generalist and proprietary alternatives.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) holds significant promise for enabling cooperative driving among Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs). However, its practical application is hindered by a critical limitation, i.e., insufficient fault tolerance against observational faults. Such faults, which appear as perturbations in the vehicles' perceived data, can substantially compromise the performance of MARL-based driving systems. Addressing this problem presents two primary challenges. One is to generate adversarial perturbations that effectively stress the policy during training, and the other is to equip vehicles with the capability to mitigate the impact of corrupted observations. To overcome the challenges, we propose a fault-tolerant MARL method for cooperative on-ramp vehicles incorporating two key agents. First, an adversarial fault injection agent is co-trained to generate perturbations that actively challenge and harden the vehicle policies. Second, we design a novel fault-tolerant vehicle agent equipped with a self-diagnosis capability, which leverages the inherent spatio-temporal correlations in vehicle state sequences to detect faults and reconstruct credible observations, thereby shielding the policy from misleading inputs. Experiments in a simulated highway merging scenario demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms baseline MARL approaches, achieving near-fault-free levels of safety and efficiency under various observation fault patterns.

Abstract: Complex and even chaotic dynamics, though prevalent in many natural and engineered systems, has been largely avoided in the design of electromechanical systems due to concerns about wear and controlability. Here, we demonstrate that complex dynamics might be particularly advantageous in soft robotics, offering new functionalities beyond motion not easily achievable with traditional actuation methods. We designed and realized resilient magnetic soft actuators capable of operating in a tunable dynamic regime for tens of thousands cycles without fatigue. We experimentally demonstrated the application of these actuators for true random number generation and stochastic computing. {W}e validate soft robots as physical reservoirs capable of performing Mackey--Glass time series prediction. These findings show that exploring the complex dynamics in soft robotics would extend the application scenarios in soft computing, human-robot interaction and collaborative robots as we demonstrate with biomimetic blinking and randomized voice modulation.

TL;DR: 提出基于CARLA的数据驱动交通微观仿真框架，利用I-24 MOTION真实时空数据重建交通波动态，通过协同仿真模块注入真实交通信息，实现感知真实的边界驱动仿真


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统微观仿真器校准难以重现交通波等瞬时现象，特别是在大规模仿真中面临挑战。需要将真实交通状态数据作为边界条件，而非在仿真中重现这些现象

Method: 1) 自动生成对应I-24的1英里高速公路段；2) 使用I-24数据驱动协同仿真模块，向仿真注入交通信息；3) 以经验数据采样的自我车辆为中心；4) 在自我车辆纵向范围内自动生成"可见"交通；5) 超出范围使用幽灵单元进行边界控制

Result: 框架在低拥堵和高拥堵场景下都能模拟波的形成和消散，涌现行为与真实交通高度一致，实现了首个感知真实的边界驱动交通波现象仿真

Conclusion: 该工作将微观建模与物理实验数据结合，为评估交通控制策略、感知驱动自主性和波缓解方案提供了新颖的协同仿真框架

Abstract: This paper introduces a data-driven traffic microsimulation framework in CARLA that reconstructs real-world wave dynamics using high-fidelity time-space data from the I-24 MOTION testbed. Calibration of road networks in microsimulators to reproduce ephemeral phenomena such as traffic waves for large-scale simulation is a process that is fraught with challenges. This work reconsiders the existence of the traffic state data as boundary conditions on an ego vehicle moving through previously recorded traffic data, rather than reproducing those traffic phenomena in a calibrated microsim. Our approach is to autogenerate a 1 mile highway segment corresponding to I-24, and use the I-24 data to power a cosimulation module that injects traffic information into the simulation. The CARLA and cosimulation simulations are centered around an ego vehicle sampled from the empirical data, with autogeneration of "visible" traffic within the longitudinal range of the ego vehicle. Boundary control beyond these visible ranges is achieved using ghost cells behind (upstream) and ahead (downstream) of the ego vehicle. Unlike prior simulation work that focuses on local car-following behavior or abstract geometries, our framework targets full time-space diagram fidelity as the validation objective. Leveraging CARLA's rich sensor suite and configurable vehicle dynamics, we simulate wave formation and dissipation in both low-congestion and high-congestion scenarios for qualitative analysis. The resulting emergent behavior closely mirrors that of real traffic, providing a novel cosimulation framework for evaluating traffic control strategies, perception-driven autonomy, and future deployment of wave mitigation solutions. Our work bridges microscopic modeling with physical experimental data, enabling the first perceptually realistic, boundary-driven simulation of empirical traffic wave phenomena in CARLA.

TL;DR: SafeHumanoid：基于视觉语言模型和检索增强生成的人类机器人交互系统，通过语义理解场景上下文来调度阻抗和速度参数，提高人形机器人的安全性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 安全可信的人类机器人交互不仅需要完成任务，还需要根据场景上下文和人类接近程度调节阻抗和速度。现有系统缺乏语义理解能力来动态调整这些参数。

Method: 提出SafeHumanoid系统，结合视觉语言模型和检索增强生成技术：1）使用以自我为中心的视觉帧；2）通过结构化VLM提示处理场景；3）嵌入并与验证场景数据库匹配；4）通过逆运动学映射到关节级阻抗命令。

Result: 在桌面操作任务（擦拭、物体交接、液体倾倒）中评估，系统能够根据上下文自适应调整刚度、阻尼和速度配置，在保持任务成功率的同时提高安全性。当前推理延迟约1.4秒。

Conclusion: 语义基础的阻抗控制是实现更安全、符合标准的人形机器人协作的可行路径，尽管当前延迟限制了高动态环境中的响应性。

Abstract: Safe and trustworthy Human Robot Interaction (HRI) requires robots not only to complete tasks but also to regulate impedance and speed according to scene context and human proximity. We present SafeHumanoid, an egocentric vision pipeline that links Vision Language Models (VLMs) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to schedule impedance and velocity parameters for a humanoid robot. Egocentric frames are processed by a structured VLM prompt, embedded and matched against a curated database of validated scenarios, and mapped to joint-level impedance commands via inverse kinematics. We evaluate the system on tabletop manipulation tasks with and without human presence, including wiping, object handovers, and liquid pouring. The results show that the pipeline adapts stiffness, damping, and speed profiles in a context-aware manner, maintaining task success while improving safety. Although current inference latency (up to 1.4 s) limits responsiveness in highly dynamic settings, SafeHumanoid demonstrates that semantic grounding of impedance control is a viable path toward safer, standard-compliant humanoid collaboration.

Motivation: 传统电磁致动器存在效率有限、体积庞大、设计复杂、成本高等问题，需要开发新型替代致动器。生物启发设计结合智能材料可创造下一代自适应、高能效的致动系统。

Method: 结合双羽状结构的高力特性和SMA的高功率重量比优势，开发多层双羽状配置的SMA致动器数学模型，并进行实验验证。采用设计失效模式与影响分析进行故障缓解策略评估。

Abstract: The increasing industrial demand for alternative actuators over conventional electromagnetism-based systems having limited efficiency, bulky size, complex design due to in-built gear-train mechanisms, and high production and amortization costs necessitates the innovation in new actuator development. Integrating bio-inspired design principles into linear actuators could bring forth the next generation of adaptive and energy efficient smart material-based actuation systems. The present study amalgamates the advantages of bipenniform architecture, which generates high force in the given physiological region and a high power-to-weight ratio of shape memory alloy (SMA), into a novel bio-inspired SMA-based linear actuator. A mathematical model of a multi-layered bipenniform configuration-based SMA actuator was developed and validated experimentally. The current research also caters to the incorporation of failure mitigation strategies using design failure mode and effects analysis along with the experimental assessment of the performance of the developed actuator. The system has been benchmarked against an industry-developed stepper motor-driven actuator. It has shown promising results generating an actuation force of 257 N with 15 V input voltage, meeting the acceptable range for actuation operation. It further exhibits about 67% reduction in the weight of the drive mechanism, with 80% lesser component, 32% cost reduction, and 19% energy savings and similar envelope dimensions for assembly compatibility with dampers and louvers for easy onsite deployment. The study introduces SMA coil-based actuator as an advanced design that can be deployed for high force-high stroke applications. The bio-inspired SMA-based linear actuator has applications ranging from building automation controls to lightweight actuation systems for space robotics and medical prosthesis.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出将机器人拆卸建模为部分可观测马尔可夫决策过程（POMDP），以处理报废产品的不确定性，并开发了基于CAD数据、机器人能力和检查结果的概率规划框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有拆卸序列规划方法通常假设确定性和完全可观测的产品模型，但实际报废产品常因磨损、腐蚀或未记录的维修而偏离初始设计，需要处理不确定性。

Method: 将拆卸建模为POMDP，隐藏变量表示不确定的结构或物理属性；提出任务与运动规划框架，从CAD数据、机器人能力和检查结果自动推导POMDP模型；使用强化学习近似求解，结合贝叶斯滤波器在执行期间持续更新对潜在报废条件的信念。

Result: 在两种机器人系统上测试三种产品，证明该概率规划框架在平均拆卸时间和方差方面优于确定性基线，能跨不同机器人设置泛化，并成功适应CAD模型的偏差（如缺失或卡住部件）。

Conclusion: 将拆卸建模为POMDP能有效处理报废产品的不确定性，提出的概率规划框架在现实拆卸任务中表现优于传统确定性方法，支持循环经济中的机器人拆卸需求。

Abstract: To support the circular economy, robotic systems must not only assemble new products but also disassemble end-of-life (EOL) ones for reuse, recycling, or safe disposal. Existing approaches to disassembly sequence planning often assume deterministic and fully observable product models, yet real EOL products frequently deviate from their initial designs due to wear, corrosion, or undocumented repairs. We argue that disassembly should therefore be formulated as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), which naturally captures uncertainty about the product's internal state. We present a mathematical formulation of disassembly as a POMDP, in which hidden variables represent uncertain structural or physical properties. Building on this formulation, we propose a task and motion planning framework that automatically derives specific POMDP models from CAD data, robot capabilities, and inspection results. To obtain tractable policies, we approximate this formulation with a reinforcement-learning approach that operates on stochastic action outcomes informed by inspection priors, while a Bayesian filter continuously maintains beliefs over latent EOL conditions during execution. Using three products on two robotic systems, we demonstrate that this probabilistic planning framework outperforms deterministic baselines in terms of average disassembly time and variance, generalizes across different robot setups, and successfully adapts to deviations from the CAD model, such as missing or stuck parts.

### [157] [The dynamic of a tax on land value : concepts, models and impact scenario](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21766)
*Hugo Spring-Ragain*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: 该研究建立了一个空间动态框架来分析土地价值税对城市土地市场、资本积累和空间再分配的理论和定量影响，揭示了土地价值税作为非线性空间系统控制变量的双重性质。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统静态均衡分析无法捕捉土地价值税的空间动态效应，需要建立能够同时考虑土地价值扩散过程和局部投资动态的框架，以理解土地价值税如何重塑价值创造的地理分布。

Method: 构建包含土地价值V(x,y,t)和建成资本K(x,y,t)的耦合非线性偏微分方程模型，引入局部生产率A(x,y)、中心效应μ(x,y)、折旧δ和财政压力τ等参数，通过解析稳态分析和数值模拟研究系统行为。

Result: 模型揭示了τ参数中的跨临界分岔，分离了非活跃（低投资）和活跃（自我维持）空间制度；扩散项稳定空间动态并产生连续梯度；土地价值税在临界范围内作为高效空间再分配算子，但超出范围会导致系统性收缩。

Conclusion: 土地价值税具有双重性质：侵蚀非生产性租金和投机性土地持有，但对建成资本的动态影响取决于局部盈利能力和融资约束；该框架连接了静态城市税收理论和动态空间经济学，为理解土地价值税的动态效率和空间公平性提供了统一视角。

Abstract: This paper develops a spatial-dynamic framework to analyze the theoretical and quantitative effects of a Land Value Tax (LVT) on urban land markets, capital accumulation, and spatial redistribution. Building upon the Georgist distinction between produced value and unearned rent, the model departs from the static equilibrium tradition by introducing an explicit diffusion process for land values and a local investment dynamic governed by profitability thresholds. Land value $V (x, y, t)$ and built capital $K(x, y, t)$evolve over a two-dimensional urban domain according to coupled nonlinear partial differential equations, incorporating local productivity $A(x, y)$, centrality effects $μ(x, y)$, depreciation $δ$, and fiscal pressure $τ$ . Analytical characterization of the steady states reveals a transcritical bifurcation in the parameter $τ$ , separating inactive (low-investment) and active (self-sustaining) spatial regimes. The equilibrium pair $(V ^*, K^*)$ is shown to exist only when the effective decay rate $α= r + τ- μ(x, y)$ exceeds a profitability threshold $θ= κ+ δ/ I_0$, and becomes locally unstable beyond this boundary. The introduction of diffusion, $D_V ΔV$, stabilizes spatial dynamics and generates continuous gradients of land value and capital intensity, mitigating speculative clustering while preserving productive incentives. Numerical simulations confirm these analytical properties and display the emergence of spatially heterogeneous steady states driven by urban centrality and local productivity. The model also quantifies key aggregate outcomes, including dynamic tax revenues, adjusted capital-to-land ratios, and net present values under spatial heterogeneity and temporal discounting. Sensitivity analyses demonstrate that the main qualitative mechanisms-critical activation, spatial recomposition, and bifurcation structure-remain robust under alternative spatial profiles $(A, μ)$, discretization schemes, and moderate differentiation of the tax rate $τ(x, y)$. From an economic perspective, the results clarify the dual nature of the LVT: while it erodes unproductive rents and speculative land holding, its dynamic incidence on built capital depends on local profitability and financing constraints. The taxation parameter $τ$ thus acts as a control variable in a nonlinear spatial system, shaping transitions between rent-driven and production-driven equilibria. Within a critical range around $τ_c$, the LVT functions as an efficient spatial reallocation operator-reducing inequality in land values and investment density without impairing aggregate productivity. Beyond this range, excessive taxation induces systemic contraction and investment stagnation. Overall, this research bridges static urban tax theory with dynamic spatial economics by formalizing how a land-based fiscal instrument can reshape the geography of value creation through endogenous diffusion and nonlinear feedback. The framework provides a foundation for future extensions involving stochastic shocks, adaptive policy feedbacks, or endogenous public investment, offering a unified quantitative perspective on the dynamic efficiency and spatial equity of land value taxation.

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个统一框架，通过三层语义分类和六层架构分解，整合AI基础设施中分散的度量标准，解决能源、计算和成本约束的交互问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模AI系统增长受到基础设施限制的制约，包括电力供应、热力和水资源约束、互连扩展、内存压力、数据管道吞吐量以及快速上升的生命周期成本。现有度量标准（如PUE、机架功率密度、网络延迟、数据管道指标、TCO等）各自为政，缺乏对物理、计算和经济约束交互作用的综合视角，阻碍了跨领域优化。

Method: 开发了一个集成框架，通过三层语义分类（物理、计算、经济）和六层架构分解，创建6x3分类法。基于对具有经济和财务相关性的所有度量标准的系统回顾和元分析，识别最广泛使用的度量标准及其跨领域相互依赖性。在此基础上构建了度量传播图（MPG），形式化跨层依赖关系。

Result: 创建了一个统一的分类法和分析框架，能够映射不同约束在AI基础设施栈中的传播方式。MPG支持系统范围解释、复合度量构建以及能源、碳和成本的多目标优化。

Conclusion: 该框架为基准测试、集群设计、容量规划和生命周期经济分析提供了连贯基础，通过统一的分析结构将物理操作、计算效率和成本结果联系起来，解决了AI基础设施中度量标准碎片化的问题。

Abstract: The growth of large-scale AI systems is increasingly constrained by infrastructure limits: power availability, thermal and water constraints, interconnect scaling, memory pressure, data-pipeline throughput, and rapidly escalating lifecycle cost. Across hyperscale clusters, these constraints interact, yet the main metrics remain fragmented. Existing metrics, ranging from facility measures (PUE) and rack power density to network metrics (all-reduce latency), data-pipeline measures, and financial metrics (TCO series), each capture only their own domain and provide no integrated view of how physical, computational, and economic constraints interact. This fragmentation obscures the structural relationships among energy, computation, and cost, preventing a coherent optimization across sector and how bottlenecks emerge, propagate, and jointly determine the efficiency frontier of AI infrastructure.
  This paper develops an integrated framework that unifies these disparate metrics through a three-domain semantic classification and a six-layer architectural decomposition, producing a 6x3 taxonomy that maps how various sectors propagate across the AI infrastructure stack. The taxonomy is grounded in a systematic review and meta-analysis of all metrics with economic and financial relevance, identifying the most widely used measures, their research intensity, and their cross-domain interdependencies. Building on this evidence base, the Metric Propagation Graph (MPG) formalizes cross-layer dependencies, enabling systemwide interpretation, composite-metric construction, and multi-objective optimization of energy, carbon, and cost.
  The framework offers a coherent foundation for benchmarking, cluster design, capacity planning, and lifecycle economic analysis by linking physical operations, computational efficiency, and cost outcomes within a unified analytic structure.

TL;DR: 该研究比较了西班牙和乌拉圭的长期发展轨迹，发现两国在1960年代后出现显著分化，主要原因是西班牙融入了欧洲制度架构，而乌拉圭则嵌入了拉美治理体系。研究使用生成对抗网络构建反事实框架，量化制度嵌入对发展的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是理解制度归属如何影响长期发展。西班牙和乌拉圭作为两个历史禀赋相似的小型民主国家，在1960年代后发展轨迹出现显著差异，这引发了关于跨国制度网络对发展影响的思考。

Method: 研究方法包括：1）比较西班牙和乌拉圭的历史发展轨迹；2）基于经济复杂性、制度路径依赖理论构建生成反事实框架；3）使用Wasserstein GAN训练1960-2020年数据；4）通过预期发展转移（EDS）量化制度重新嵌入的潜在影响。

Result: 反事实模拟显示：西班牙若处于拉美制度配置下会经历显著发展衰退，而乌拉圭若处于欧洲制度体系下会获得更高的经济复杂性和韧性。这证实了跨国制度网络对发展的结构性影响。

Conclusion: 发展不仅由国内改革决定，更取决于国家在跨国制度网络中的结构性位置。制度嵌入对长期发展具有决定性影响，这为理解发展差异提供了新的制度视角。

Abstract: This paper examines how institutional belonging shapes long-term development by comparing Spain and Uruguay, two small democracies with similar historical endowments whose trajectories diverged sharply after the 1960s. While Spain integrated into dense European institutional architectures, Uruguay remained embedded within the Latin American governance regime, characterized by weaker coordination and lower institutional coherence. To assess how alternative institutional embeddings could have altered these paths, the study develops a generative counterfactual framework grounded in economic complexity, institutional path dependence, and a Wasserstein GAN trained on data from 1960-2020. The resulting Expected Developmental Shift (EDS) quantifies structural gains or losses from hypothetical re-embedding in different institutional ecosystems. Counterfactual simulations indicate that Spain would have experienced significant developmental decline under a Latin American configuration, while Uruguay would have achieved higher complexity and resilience within a European regime. These findings suggest that development is not solely determined by domestic reforms but emerges from a country's structural position within transnational institutional networks.

TL;DR: 该论文重新审视巴菲特2003年提出的可交易进口证书(TIC)方案，将其作为保障战略性产业供应安全的政策工具，分析其在竞争市场和存在市场势力情况下的优缺点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来危机加剧了对战略性产业供应安全的担忧，各国通过补贴、关税等手段促进国内产能。需要重新审视巴菲特的TIC方案，将其作为连接进口与出口表现的替代政策工具。

Method: 采用简单的两国模型分析TIC方案，将其与传统进口配额比较，重点研究证书价格如何发挥类似灵活关税和出口补贴的作用，并分析不同市场结构下的效果。

Result: 在竞争市场中，TIC是透明高效的政策工具，能有效减少其他国家通过隐藏补贴或非关税壁垒违反协议的动机。但当国内生产者在证书市场拥有市场势力时，TIC可能产生负面影响。

Conclusion: TIC作为连接进口与出口的政策工具，在竞争性市场环境下具有优势，但需警惕市场势力可能带来的负面效应，为战略性产业供应安全政策提供了新的分析视角。

Abstract: Recent crises have increased concerns about supply security in sectors that are considered strategically important. The goal of sufficient domestic production capacities has motivated various forms of subsidies, tariffs and other instruments. This paper revisits Warren Buffett's (2003) proposal of tradeable import certificates (TIC) in this context. TIC differ from classical import quotas mainly by linking the import volume to export performance. The certificate price functions like a mix of flexible tariffs and export subsidies whose levels depend on net imports in the strategic sector. We analyse benefits and drawbacks in a simple two-country model. In competitive markets, TIC constitute a transparent and efficient instrument that effectively reduces incentives for other countries to deviate from agreements via hidden subsidies or non-tariff trade barriers. However, TIC can have adverse effects if there are domestic producers with market power in the certificate market.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究战斗暴露对长期死亡率的影响，但面临识别挑战。使用越南战争征兵抽签作为准实验设计，旨在更准确地估计战斗暴露的长期健康后果。

Method: 使用越南战争征兵抽签作为准实验设计，通过分析战斗死亡率验证抽签有效性。采用逆向识别方法，将征兵资格作为结果变量建模，使用仅包含死亡者的数据集进行分析。

Result: 1950年出生的黑人男性存在显著超额死亡率（1.09%，约2700额外死亡），而1951-1952年出生群体未检测到显著影响。研究发现将战斗暴露有限的群体合并分析可能掩盖真实的队列层面治疗效果。

Conclusion: 战斗暴露对长期死亡率有显著影响，特别是对1950年出生的黑人男性。研究设计需要考虑不同出生队列的战斗暴露差异，避免将暴露有限的群体合并分析，以免掩盖真实的治疗效果。

Abstract: This study examines long-term mortality effects of combat exposure using the Vietnam War draft lottery as a quasi-experiment. We validate the lottery by analyzing combat fatalities, revealing that 1951-1952 cohorts had notably fewer lottery-induced deployments than 1950, limiting detectable long-term mortality impacts at the cohort level. Using deceased-only datasets, we invert standard identification by modeling draft eligibility as the outcome. We find significant excess mortality among Black men in the 1950 cohort (1.09\%, approximately 2,700 additional deaths), and null effects in later cohorts. Findings suggest that pooling cohorts with limited combat exposure may prevent detection of true treatment effects at cohort levels.

TL;DR: 该研究分析了41个国家1980-2016年间的菲利普斯曲线关系，发现该关系在不同国家和时期存在显著差异，在经济平稳时期对发达国家有效，但在衰退期完全失效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管菲利普斯曲线的实证文献丰富，但对其有效性和稳定性仍缺乏广泛共识。现有研究表明该关系脆弱且随国家和时期变化，需要更全面的跨国长期分析来理解其动态特征。

Method: 对41个国家1980-2016年期间的数据进行实证分析，特别关注经济平稳期和衰退期的通胀动态行为，比较不同国家类型（发达、新兴、前沿经济体）的表现差异。

Result: 菲利普斯曲线关系在发达国家多数情况下成立，但在新兴和前沿经济体的平稳期不成立；衰退期间该关系在所有国家（包括发达市场）完全崩溃。衰退期通胀的前瞻和后顾成分显著增加，菲利普斯系数在模型中失去显著性。

Conclusion: 经济环境的平稳性对菲利普斯权衡机制的正常运作至关重要。衰退期间市场对通胀更加敏感，菲利普斯关系失效，表明该理论框架具有明显的环境依赖性。

Abstract: Although empirical literature regarding the Phillips curve is sizeable enough, there is still no wide consensus on its validity and stability. The literature shows that the Phillips relationship is fragile and varies across countries and time periods; a statistical relationship that appears strong during one decade (country) may be weak the next (other). This variability might have some grounds for idiosyncrasy of a country and its economic environment. To address it, this paper scrutinizes the Phillips relationship over 41 countries over the period 1980-2016, paying attention to how inflation dynamics behave during tranquil and recessionary periods. As a result, the paper confirms the variability of the Phillips relationship across countries, as well as time periods. It documents that the relationship holds in the majority of developed countries, while it fails to hold in emerging and frontier economies during tranquil periods. On the other hand, the relationship totally collapses during recessionary periods, even in developed markets. This shows that tranquillity of economic environment is significantly important for the Phillip trade-off to work smoothly. Moreover, both backward- and forward-looking fractions of inflation remarkably increase during recessionary periods as a result of the Phillips coefficient loses its significance within the model. This indicates that markets become more inflation-sensitive during these periods.

TL;DR: 该研究检验了41个国家在1980-2016年间预期增强型菲利普斯曲线的有效性和稳定性，发现通胀预期特征在1990年后增强，发达市场比新兴市场更前瞻性，且7个国家因高通胀历史而无法适用该曲线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文献对通胀与失业关系的实证结果存在矛盾，菲利普斯曲线的有效性和稳定性缺乏共识，且受国家特定因素和考察时期影响。考虑到这一权衡对政策制定者的重要性，本研究旨在检验预期增强型菲利普斯曲线在41个国家不同时期的有效性和稳定性。

Method: 研究采用预期增强型菲利普斯曲线框架，对41个国家在1980-2016年间的三个不同时期进行分析，同时进行国别特定估计和面板估计分析。

Result: 1. 通胀的前瞻性特征在1990年后增强，表明通胀对预期价格更加敏感；2. 发达市场的通胀比新兴市场和前沿市场更具前瞻性；3. 巴西、希腊、印度尼西亚、墨西哥、南非、罗马尼亚和土耳其的前瞻性和后顾性菲利普斯曲线均失效，归因于这些国家长期高波动通胀历史。

Conclusion: 菲利普斯曲线的有效性和稳定性存在显著的时期和国家差异，通胀预期特征随时间演变，发达市场更注重前瞻性预期，而长期高通胀国家的菲利普斯曲线关系可能失效，这对货币政策制定具有重要启示。

Abstract: The empirical literature provides mixed results on the relationship between inflation and unemployment, therefore, there is no consensus on validity and stability of the Phillips Curve. It also seems to be closely related with country-specific factors and the examination time periods. Considering the importance of this trade-off for policy-makers, this study aims to examine validity and stability of expectations-augmented Phillips Curve across 41 countries focusing on three different time periods between 1980 and 2016. The study documents several findings both in country-specific and in panel estimation analysis. First, we find that forward-looking characteristic of inflation picks up weight after 1990's which indicates that inflation became more sensitive to the expected prices. Second, we observe that inflation in developed markets is more forward-looking comparing to emerging and frontier markets. This indicates that developed markets dear forward-looking price expectations more than other markets. Third, we find that that both forward- and backward-looking Phillips Curve fails to work in Brazil, Greece, Indonesia, Mexico, South Africa, Romania, and Turkey. We address it to their long history of high and volatile inflation.

Motivation: 许多分配系统要求申请者对多属性捆绑（如结合院校、专业和学费的项目）进行排序，但这一报告任务是否固有困难，以及报告界面如何影响准确性和福利尚不清楚。

Method: 通过实验室实验，诱导参与者对项目产生偏好（词典序、可分离或互补偏好），比较三种直接序列独裁机制的报告界面：完整项目排序、词典嵌套界面、加权属性界面，以及研究明显策略证明的顺序序列独裁机制，并设置纯准确性基线。

Result: 1. 即使在纯准确性基线中也出现大量误报，且随偏好复杂性增加；2. 序列独裁导致与误判激励一致的额外错误；3. 简化界面未能改善（有时降低）准确性；4. 顺序选择实现最高准确性，同时提高效率并减少合理嫉妒。

Conclusion: 研究结果对限制性报告语言提出警告，当排序负担显著时，更倾向于顺序选择机制。

Abstract: Many assignment systems require applicants to rank multi-attribute bundles (e.g., programs combining institution, major, and tuition). We study whether this reporting task is inherently difficult and how reporting interfaces affect accuracy and welfare. In laboratory experiments, we induce preferences over programs via utility over attributes, generating lexicographic, separable, or complementary preferences. We compare three reporting interfaces for the direct serial dictatorship mechanism: (i) a full ranking over programs; (ii) a lexicographic-nesting interface; and (iii) a weighted-attributes interface, the latter two eliciting rankings over attributes rather than programs. We also study the sequential serial dictatorship mechanism that is obviously strategy-proof and simplifies reporting by asking for a single choice at each step. Finally, we run a baseline that elicits a full ranking over programs but rewards pure accuracy rather than allocation outcomes. Four main findings emerge. First, substantial misreporting occurs even in the pure-accuracy baseline and increases with preference complexity. Second, serial dictatorship induces additional mistakes consistent with misperceived incentives. Third, simplified interfaces for the direct serial dictatorship fail to improve (and sometimes reduce) accuracy, even when they match the preference structure. Fourth, sequential choice achieves the highest accuracy while improving efficiency and reducing justified envy. These findings caution against restricted reporting languages and favor sequential choice when ranking burdens are salient.

TL;DR: 跨模态效应在跨文化研究中得到验证：日本和美国参与者在跨模态决策（比较不同结果）时比单模态决策（比较相似结果）更有耐心，效应在组间设计中更强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究跨模态效应（跨模态决策比单模态决策更有耐心）是否具有文化普遍性，以及该效应是否受认知能力、社会地位等已知时间偏好相关因素影响。

Method: 采用两个实验：实验1为组间设计（参与者只做单模态或跨模态决策），实验2为组内设计（参与者同时做两种决策）。比较日本和美国参与者的时间偏好。

Result: 成功复制了跨模态效应；效应大小不受认知能力、社会地位等因素影响；日本参与者比美国参与者更有耐心，但跨模态效应在两国间无差异；组间设计的效应比组内设计更强。

Conclusion: 跨模态效应具有文化普遍性，支持该效应源于注意力稀释的基本认知过程，而非文化特定因素。

Abstract: This paper examines how outcome modality in intertemporal choice influences time preferences and whether the process differs across cultures, specifically Japan and the United States. Uni-modal choices are those when the outcomes being compared over time are very similar, and cross-modal choices are those when the outcomes are very different. The cross-modal effect, previously shown in the U.S., is that there is greater patience in cross-modal decisions. In Experiment 1, we employed a between-participants design, in which participants either made uni-modal or cross-modal decisions. In Experiment 2, we employed a within-participants design in which everyone made both types of decision. In both Experiments we replicated the cross-modal effect. Moreover, the magnitude of the effect did not vary with factors known to relate to time preference, such as cognitive ability and social status, and it did not differ across cultures, even though Japanese participants were much more patient than American ones. The effect was stronger in the between- than within-participants experiment. These results strengthen the conclusion that the cross-modal effect is universal and strengthens the argument that it is due to the fundamental process of attentional dilution.

TL;DR: 研究网络系统中公共服务质量的监管模式选择：分散监管成本低但本地化，集中监管成本高但能内化溢出效应。模型得出内生集中化阈值，超过该阈值集中监管更优。在美国养老院行业的实证检验支持了理论预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多公共服务在具有网络效应的系统中提供，质量既取决于本地努力，也取决于上级监管。网络中的监管具有公共品性质和战略互补性，需要研究不同监管模式（分散vs集中）在网络环境下的相对优劣。

Method: 建立理论模型：将监管视为网络中的公共品，具有战略互补性。监管者在分散监管（成本低、本地化）和集中监管（成本高但内化溢出效应）之间选择。模型推导出内生集中化阈值。进行实证检验：使用美国养老院行业数据（CMS设施数据），分析连锁和县级网络中的同伴效应，估计严重监管失败的网络规模阈值。

Result: 理论模型得出：对于给定的溢出强度，存在网络规模阈值n*(λ)，超过该值集中监管严格占优；对于给定的网络规模n，存在临界互补性λ*(n)，超过该值分散监管变得脆弱。实证发现：美国养老院行业存在显著的链内和县内同伴效应，严重监管失败（特殊关注设施指定）的网络规模阈值约为每县7个养老院和每链34个养老院，超过这些阈值溢出效应加剧，缺陷结果更加分散且容易恶化。

Conclusion: 网络规模和质量溢出效应共同决定了最优监管结构。当网络规模超过临界阈值时，分散监管变得脆弱，集中监管成为必要。这一发现对公共服务网络（如养老院、学校、医院）的监管设计具有重要政策意义，强调了根据网络特征调整监管模式的重要性。

Abstract: Many public services are produced in networked systems where quality depends on local effort and on how higher-level authorities monitor providers. We develop a simple model in which monitoring is a public good on a network with strategic complementarities. A regulator chooses between decentralized monitoring (cheaper, local oversight) and centralized monitoring (more costly, but internalizing spillovers). The model delivers an endogenous centralization threshold: for a given spillover strength, there exists a network size $n^\ast(λ)$ above which centralized monitoring strictly dominates; equivalently, for a given network size $n$, there is a critical complementarity $λ^\ast(n)$ beyond which decentralized oversight becomes fragile. A stochastic extension suggests that, above this region, idiosyncratic shocks are amplified, producing stronger peer correlations, higher variance, and more frequent deterioration in quality. We test these predictions in the U.S. nursing home sector, where facilities belong to overlapping organizational (chain) and geographic (county) networks. Using CMS facility data, We document strong within-chain and within-county peer effects and estimate network-size thresholds for severe regulatory failure (Special Focus Facility designations). We find sharp breakpoints at roughly 7 homes per county and 34 homes per chain, above which spillovers intensify and deficiency outcomes become more dispersed and prone to deterioration, especially in large counties.

### [167] [Suppression and Deterrence: Revisiting the Welfare Consequence of HIV Stigma](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23328)
*Pengyu Li*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: HIV stigma既有抑制HIV检测的负面效应，也有遏制危险性行为的正面效应，两者并存使得社会最优的污名化水平可能高于自然水平，因此政府完全消除污名化可能并非最优选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 政府为减轻HIV污名化的努力主要基于污名化会抑制HIV检测率的观点，但长期以来忽视了污名化对危险性行为的遏制作用。需要全面评估污名化的双重效应。

Method: 在现有HIV污名化分析框架基础上增加一个阶段，正式建模人们在性行为中是否采取预防措施的选择。通过功利主义福利分析评估污名化的社会影响。

Result: 模型显示当明确考虑性行为时，污名化的抑制效应（降低检测率）和遏制效应（减少危险性行为）同时存在，使得污名化的净社会影响变得模糊。福利最大化分析表明，最优污名化水平可能高于自然水平。

Conclusion: 政府减轻HIV污名化的努力并不总是提高社会福利，研究为维持一定水平的HIV污名化以最大化社会福利提供了理论依据。

Abstract: The government's effort to alleviate HIV stigma has been justified by the suppression effect of stigma on the HIV testing rate. Nevertheless, the deterrence effect of stigma on undesirable sexual behaviours has long been overlooked. This study adapts the existing framework on HIV stigma with an additional stage that formally models people's choices on whether to take preventive measures in sex. The model shows that, when sex is explicitly modelled, the suppression and deterrence effects coexist, which makes the net societal impact of HIV stigma ambiguous. A utilitarian welfare analysis concludes that the welfare-maximizing stigma level can be higher than its natural level, implying that the government's effort to reduce stigma is not always welfare-improving. Instead, the study provides a rationale for maintaining a certain level of HIV stigma to maximize social welfare.

TL;DR: 本文实证检验了1960-2024年西班牙经济中利润率下降规律，通过将国民账户数据转化为马克思主义变量，证实了马克思理论在当代的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证马克思在《资本论》第三卷中提出的利润率下降趋势规律是否在当代西班牙经济中仍然适用，为资本主义结构性动态提供定量证据。

Method: 将西班牙国民账户(CNE)的宏观经济数据转化为马克思主义变量：不变资本(c)、可变资本(v)和剩余价值(pv)，构建资本有机构成(q)、剩余价值率(pv')和利润率(g')的历史序列，并进行价格调整以确保时间可比性。

Result: 结果显示资本有机构成(q)持续上升，剩余价值率(pv')轻微下降，导致利润率(g')呈现下降趋势并伴随特定危机的周期性波动。

Conclusion: 实证证实了利润率下降规律在西班牙的有效性，揭示了资本主义的历史局限性，为资本主义结构性动态提供了定量证据。

Abstract: This article examines the law of the tendency of the rate of profit to fall in the Spanish economy between 1960 and 2024, considering the organic composition of capital and the rate of surplus value as central variables. Its aim is to determine whether this law, formulated by Marx in Capital (Vol. III), continues to operate in the contemporary context. The methodology consists of transforming orthodox macroeconomic categories derived from the Spanish National Accounts (CNE), available in BDMACRO, into Marxist variables: constant capital ($c$), variable capital ($v$), and surplus value ($pv$). Based on these, historical series of the organic composition of capital ($q$), the rate of surplus value ($pv'$), and the rate of profit ($g'$) are constructed, adjusted to constant prices to ensure temporal coherence and comparability. The results show a sustained increase in $q$ and a slight decrease in $pv'$, generating a tendential decline in $g'$ with cyclical fluctuations associated with specific crises. The conclusions empirically confirm the validity of the law in Spain, highlighting the historical limits of capitalism and providing quantitative evidence on the structural dynamics of profitability.
