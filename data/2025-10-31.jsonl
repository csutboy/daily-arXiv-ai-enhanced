To build the controller, we\nfirst define tracking errors between the measured and desired quadrotor\noutputs, which allow the system to be rewritten in a new set of state\nvariables. Using this transformed model, we apply Lyapunov theory to derive a\nbackstepping control law. To avoid repeated differentiation of states and\nvirtual controls, a first-order command filter is introduced, and a nonlinear\ndisturbance observer is added to provide disturbance estimates. Each state in\nthe controller and observer is replaced with its estimate from the HGO. The\nresulting control law enables the quadrotor to follow its path despite internal\nand external disturbances, with each subsystem allowed its own disturbance type\nfor realism. A new state transformation and Lyapunov-based derivation prevent\nthe usual explosion of complexity, while the HGO reconstructs unmeasured states\nand their rates for output feedback. The nonlinear disturbance observer\nattenuates constant and nonlinear disturbances as well as band-limited white\nnoise. The method reduces dependence on high-precision sensors and mitigates\nwind, model error, and rotor noise effects during flight. Unlike previous\nstudies that treat either disturbance rejection or partial sensing, this work\ncombines the command filter, disturbance observer, and HGO to address both\nchallenges simultaneously while avoiding the complexity growth typical of\nbackstepping designs."}

However,\nmost existing tactile sensors are calibrated only on flat substrates, and their\naccuracy and consistency degrade once mounted on curved geometries.

To address this\nchallenge, we develop a calibration model for a widely used resistive tactile\nsensor design that enables accurate force estimation on one-dimensional curved\nsurfaces. We then train a neural network (a multilayer perceptron) to predict\nlocal curvature from baseline sensor outputs recorded under no applied load,\nachieving an R2 score of 0.91. The proposed approach is validated on five daily\nobjects with varying curvatures under forces from 2 N to 8 N.

To assess and demonstrate the functionality and\nperformance of the proposed approach, we performed numerical simulations and\nexecuted dozens of real-time tumble-recovery maneuvers using a small quadrotor.\nThese simulations and flight tests compellingly demonstrate that the proposed\naxis-angle-based method achieves superior flight performance-compared with that\nobtained using a high-performance quaternion-based controller-in terms of\nstabilization time."}

By first establishing a converse ISSf-BF theorem, we reveal\nthe equivalence among the achievability of ISSf by feedback, the achievability\nof inverse optimality, and the solvability of a Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs equation\nassociated with the inverse optimal ISSf gain assignment. Then we develop a\ncollection of safety margin results on the overall control u=u0+u*. In the\nabsence of disturbances, we find that standard inverse optimal safe controllers\nhave a certain degree of gain margin. Specifically, when f(x) acts safely but\nu0 acts unsafely, the gain can be decreased by up to half; and when f(x) acts\nunsafely, we establish that, if u0 acts safely, the gain can be increased\narbitrarily, whereas if u0 acts unsafely, the control recovers the full gain\nmargin [1/2,inf). It is shown, however, that under control gain variation, the\nsafe set of these controllers is locally asymptotically stable, which implies\nthat their safety is sensitive to large but bounded disturbances. To make\ninverse optimal ISSf controllers robust to gain variation, we propose a gain\nmargin improvement approach at the expense of an increased control effort.

However, conventional methods, such as\nclosed-circuit television, dashcam footage, and sensor-based detection,\nseparate detection from verification, suffer from limited flexibility, and\nrequire dense infrastructure or high penetration rates, restricting\nadaptability and scalability to shifting incident hotspots. To overcome these\nchallenges, we developed DARTS, a drone-based, AI-powered real-time traffic\nincident detection system. DARTS integrates drones' high mobility and aerial\nperspective for adaptive surveillance, thermal imaging for better\nlow-visibility performance and privacy protection, and a lightweight deep\nlearning framework for real-time vehicle trajectory extraction and incident\ndetection. The system achieved 99% detection accuracy on a self-collected\ndataset and supports simultaneous online visual verification, severity\nassessment, and incident-induced congestion propagation monitoring via a\nweb-based interface. In a field test on Interstate 75 in Florida, DARTS\ndetected and verified a rear-end collision 12 minutes earlier than the local\ntransportation management center and monitored incident-induced congestion\npropagation, suggesting potential to support faster emergency response and\nenable proactive traffic control to reduce congestion and secondary crash risk.\nCrucially, DARTS's flexible deployment architecture reduces dependence on\nfrequent physical patrols, indicating potential scalability and\ncost-effectiveness for use in remote areas and resource-constrained settings.\nThis study presents a promising step toward a more flexible and integrated\nreal-time traffic incident detection system, with significant implications for\nthe operational efficiency and responsiveness of modern transportation\nmanagement."}

Submitted to arXiv for open access", "summary": "Existing frameworks converge on the centrality of compression to intelligence\nbut leave underspecified why this process enforces the discovery of causal\nstructure rather than superficial statistical patterns. We introduce a\ntwo-level framework to address this gap. The Information-Theoretic Imperative\n(ITI) establishes that any system persisting in uncertain environments must\nminimize epistemic entropy through predictive compression: this is the\nevolutionary \"why\" linking survival pressure to information-processing demands.\nThe Compression Efficiency Principle (CEP) specifies how efficient compression\nmechanically selects for generative, causal models through\nexception-accumulation dynamics, making reality alignment a consequence rather\nthan a contingent achievement. Together, ITI and CEP define a causal chain:\nfrom survival pressure to prediction necessity, compression requirement,\nefficiency optimization, generative structure discovery, and ultimately reality\nalignment. Each link follows from physical, information-theoretic, or\nevolutionary constraints, implying that intelligence is the mechanically\nnecessary outcome of persistence in structured environments. This framework\nyields empirically testable predictions: compression efficiency, measured as\napproach to the rate-distortion frontier, correlates with out-of-distribution\ngeneralization; exception-accumulation rates differentiate causal from\ncorrelational models; hierarchical systems exhibit increasing efficiency across\nabstraction layers; and biological systems demonstrate metabolic costs that\ntrack representational complexity.

To build the controller, we\nfirst define tracking errors between the measured and desired quadrotor\noutputs, which allow the system to be rewritten in a new set of state\nvariables. Using this transformed model, we apply Lyapunov theory to derive a\nbackstepping control law. To avoid repeated differentiation of states and\nvirtual controls, a first-order command filter is introduced, and a nonlinear\ndisturbance observer is added to provide disturbance estimates. Each state in\nthe controller and observer is replaced with its estimate from the HGO. The\nresulting control law enables the quadrotor to follow its path despite internal\nand external disturbances, with each subsystem allowed its own disturbance type\nfor realism. A new state transformation and Lyapunov-based derivation prevent\nthe usual explosion of complexity, while the HGO reconstructs unmeasured states\nand their rates for output feedback. The nonlinear disturbance observer\nattenuates constant and nonlinear disturbances as well as band-limited white\nnoise. The method reduces dependence on high-precision sensors and mitigates\nwind, model error, and rotor noise effects during flight. Unlike previous\nstudies that treat either disturbance rejection or partial sensing, this work\ncombines the command filter, disturbance observer, and HGO to address both\nchallenges simultaneously while avoiding the complexity growth typical of\nbackstepping designs."}

We introduce a\ntwo-level framework to address this gap. The Information-Theoretic Imperative\n(ITI) establishes that any system persisting in uncertain environments must\nminimize epistemic entropy through predictive compression: this is the\nevolutionary \"why\" linking survival pressure to information-processing demands.\nThe Compression Efficiency Principle (CEP) specifies how efficient compression\nmechanically selects for generative, causal models through\nexception-accumulation dynamics, making reality alignment a consequence rather\nthan a contingent achievement. Together, ITI and CEP define a causal chain:\nfrom survival pressure to prediction necessity, compression requirement,\nefficiency optimization, generative structure discovery, and ultimately reality\nalignment. Each link follows from physical, information-theoretic, or\nevolutionary constraints, implying that intelligence is the mechanically\nnecessary outcome of persistence in structured environments. This framework\nyields empirically testable predictions: compression efficiency, measured as\napproach to the rate-distortion frontier, correlates with out-of-distribution\ngeneralization; exception-accumulation rates differentiate causal from\ncorrelational models; hierarchical systems exhibit increasing efficiency across\nabstraction layers; and biological systems demonstrate metabolic costs that\ntrack representational complexity.

Then we develop a\ncollection of safety margin results on the overall control u=u0+u*. In the\nabsence of disturbances, we find that standard inverse optimal safe controllers\nhave a certain degree of gain margin.

If this\npowerful AI is to serve the needs of consumers, voters, and decision makers,\nthen it is imperative that the AI is accountable.

Unfortunately, in too many cases today's\nAI is not accountable -- we cannot question it, enter into a discussion with\nit, let alone sanction it.

This\nwork aims to develop the mathematical underpinnings of such a representation --\nspecifically, the goal is to develop safety filters that are risk-aware. To\nthis end, we take a two step approach: encoding an understanding of the\nenvironment via Poisson's equation, and associated risk via Laplace guidance\nfields. That is, we first solve a Dirichlet problem for Poisson's equation to\ngenerate a safety function that encodes system safety as its 0-superlevel set.\nWe then separately solve a Dirichlet problem for Laplace's equation to\nsynthesize a safe \\textit{guidance field} that encodes variable levels of\ncaution around obstacles -- by enforcing a tunable flux boundary condition.

To address this, we propose Thor, a\nhumanoid framework for human-level whole-body reactions in contact-rich\nenvironments. Based on the robot's force analysis, we design a force-adaptive\ntorso-tilt (FAT2) reward function to encourage humanoids to exhibit human-like\nresponses during force-interaction tasks.

This\nlimitation restricts their reliability in practical use. To address this\nchallenge, we develop a calibration model for a widely used resistive tactile\nsensor design that enables accurate force estimation on one-dimensional curved\nsurfaces. We then train a neural network (a multilayer perceptron) to predict\nlocal curvature from baseline sensor outputs recorded under no applied load,\nachieving an R2 score of 0.91.

FM\nAgent reaches state-of-the-art results autonomously, without human\ninterpretation or tuning -- 1976.3 on ALE-Bench (+5.2\\%), 43.56\\% on MLE-Bench\n(+4.0pp), up to 20x speedups on KernelBench, and establishes new\nstate-of-the-art(SOTA) results on several classical mathematical problems.\nBeyond academic benchmarks, FM Agent shows considerable promise for both\nlarge-scale enterprise R\\&D workflows and fundamental scientific research,\nwhere it can accelerate innovation, automate complex discovery processes, and\ndeliver substantial engineering and scientific advances with broader societal\nimpact."}

To mitigate the high-dimensional\nchallenges of humanoid control, Thor introduces a reinforcement learning\narchitecture that decouples the upper body, waist, and lower body. Each\ncomponent shares global observations of the whole body and jointly updates its\nparameters. Finally, we deploy Thor on the Unitree G1, and it substantially\noutperforms baselines in force-interaction tasks. Specifically, the robot\nachieves a peak pulling force of 167.7 N (approximately 48% of the G1's body\nweight) when moving backward and 145.5 N when moving forward, representing\nimprovements of 68.9% and 74.7%, respectively, compared with the\nbest-performing baseline. Moreover, Thor is capable of pulling a loaded rack\n(130 N) and opening a fire door with one hand (60 N). These results highlight\nThor's effectiveness in enhancing humanoid force-interaction capabilities."}

LFI assumes an arbitrary support for sampling, which remains\nconstant as the initial generic prior is iteratively refined to more\ndescriptive posteriors. However, a potentially misspecified support can lead to\nsuboptimal, yet falsely certain, posteriors. To address this issue, we propose\nthree heuristic LFI variants: EDGE, MODE, and CENTRE. Each interprets the\nposterior mode shift over inference steps in its own way and, when integrated\ninto an LFI step, adapts the support alongside posterior inference. We first\nexpose the support misspecification issue and evaluate our heuristics using\nstochastic dynamical benchmarks. We then evaluate the impact of heuristic\nsupport adaptation on parameter inference and policy learning for a dynamic\ndeformable linear object (DLO) manipulation task. Inference results in a finer\nlength and stiffness classification for a parametric set of DLOs.

However,\napproaches built on ordinary and stochastic denoising processes struggle to\njointly achieve fast sampling and strong multi-modality. To address these\nchallenges, we propose the Hybrid Consistency Policy (HCP). HCP runs a short\nstochastic prefix up to an adaptive switch time, and then applies a one-step\nconsistency jump to produce the final action. To align this one-jump\ngeneration, HCP performs time-varying consistency distillation that combines a\ntrajectory-consistency objective to keep neighboring predictions coherent and a\ndenoising-matching objective to improve local fidelity. In both simulation and\non a real robot, HCP with 25 SDE steps plus one jump approaches the 80-step\nDDPM teacher in accuracy and mode coverage while significantly reducing\nlatency. These results show that multi-modality does not require slow\ninference, and a switch time decouples mode retention from speed.

Unlike prior studies that attribute\nthis text bias to external factors such as data imbalance or instruction\ntuning, we propose that the bias originates from the model's internal\narchitecture. Specifically, we hypothesize that visual key vectors (Visual\nKeys) are out-of-distribution (OOD) relative to the text key space learned\nduring language-only pretraining. Consequently, these visual keys receive\nsystematically lower similarity scores during attention computation, leading to\ntheir under-utilization in the context representation. To validate this\nhypothesis, we extract key vectors from LLaVA and Qwen2.5-VL and analyze their\ndistributional structures using qualitative (t-SNE) and quantitative\n(Jensen-Shannon divergence) methods. The results provide direct evidence that\nvisual and textual keys occupy markedly distinct subspaces within the attention\nspace.

We\nstudy a minimal control interface where an agent chooses whether to act\nautonomously (play) or defer (ask), while a human simultaneously chooses\nwhether to be permissive (trust) or to engage in oversight (oversee). If the\nagent defers, the human's choice determines the outcome, potentially leading to\na corrective action or a system shutdown. We model this interaction as a\ntwo-player Markov Game. Our analysis focuses on cases where this game qualifies\nas a Markov Potential Game (MPG), a class of games where we can provide an\nalignment guarantee: under a structural assumption on the human's value\nfunction, any decision by the agent to act more autonomously that benefits\nitself cannot harm the human's value. We also analyze extensions to this MPG\nframework. Theoretically, this perspective provides conditions for a specific\nform of intrinsic alignment. If the reward structures of the human-agent game\nmeet these conditions, we have a formal guarantee that the agent improving its\nown outcome will not harm the human's. Practically, this model motivates a\ntransparent control layer with predictable incentives where the agent learns to\ndefer when risky and act when safe, while its pretrained policy and the\nenvironment's reward structure remain untouched. Our gridworld simulation shows\nthat through independent learning, the agent and human discover their optimal\noversight roles.
