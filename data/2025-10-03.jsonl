To address these\nchallenges, we introduce a hardware--software co-design framework. First, we\npropose \\texttt{Lighten}, a PTC-aware compression flow that post-hoc decomposes\neach Transformer weight matrix into a low-rank component plus a\nstructured-sparse component aligned to photonic tensor-core granularity,\nwithout lengthy retraining.

First, the system is able to simulate calibrated\neditorial judgment, with 'Revise' decisions consistently forming the majority\noutcome (>50%) across all disciplines, while 'Reject' rates dynamically adapt\nto field-specific norms, rising to 45% in Health Sciences. Second, it maintains\nunwavering procedural integrity, enforcing a stable 29% evidence-anchoring\ncompliance rate that remains invariant across diverse review tasks and\nscientific domains.

To explore this, we\nproposed Gen-SRL, an annotation schema to categorize student prompts into 16\nmicrolevel actions across 4 macrolevel phases. Using the proposed schema, we\nannotated 212 chatbot interactions from a real-world English writing task. We\nthen performed frequency analysis and process mining (PM) techniques to\ndiscover SRL patterns in depth.

This paper proposes a safe motion planning strategy\ncombining Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Control Barrier Functions (CBFs).\nWe introduce a time-varying inflated ellipse obstacle representation, where the\ninflation radius is adjusted depending on the relative position and attitude\nbetween the vessel and the obstacle. The proposed adaptive inflation reduces\nthe conservativeness of the controller compared to traditional fixed-ellipsoid\nobstacle formulations.

We introduce factors based on\ncontinuous-time kinematics that are corrupted by a white noise Gaussian process\n(GP). By using a simple robot model paired with high-rate sensing, we show\nadaptability to unmodelled external forces and data dropout.

Here we show the pervasiveness\nand harmful impacts of sycophancy when people seek advice from AI. First,\nacross 11 state-of-the-art AI models, we find that models are highly\nsycophantic: they affirm users' actions 50% more than humans do, and they do so\neven in cases where user queries mention manipulation, deception, or other\nrelational harms. Second, in two preregistered experiments (N = 1604),\nincluding a live-interaction study where participants discuss a real\ninterpersonal conflict from their life, we find that interaction with\nsycophantic AI models significantly reduced participants' willingness to take\nactions to repair interpersonal conflict, while increasing their conviction of\nbeing in the right.

Recent Vision-Language models (VLMs)\noffer strong priors for grounding language and perception, but remain difficult\nto steer for navigation due to differences in action spaces and pretraining\nobjectives that hamper transferability to robotics tasks. Towards addressing\nthis, we introduce VENTURA, a vision-language navigation system that finetunes\ninternet-pretrained image diffusion models for path planning. Instead of\ndirectly predicting low-level actions, VENTURA generates a path mask (i.e. a\nvisual plan) in image space that captures fine-grained, context-aware\nnavigation behaviors. A lightweight behavior-cloning policy grounds these\nvisual plans into executable trajectories, yielding an interface that follows\nnatural language instructions to generate diverse robot behaviors. To scale\ntraining, we supervise on path masks derived from self-supervised tracking\nmodels paired with VLM-augmented captions, avoiding manual pixel-level\nannotation or highly engineered data collection setups. In extensive real-world\nevaluations, VENTURA outperforms state-of-the-art foundation model baselines on\nobject reaching, obstacle avoidance, and terrain preference tasks, improving\nsuccess rates by 33% and reducing collisions by 54% across both seen and unseen\nscenarios. Notably, we find that VENTURA generalizes to unseen combinations of\ndistinct tasks, revealing emergent compositional capabilities.

Conventional methods prioritize correlation or fit, often\noverlooking confounding variables and limiting generalizability to unseen\ntropical storms. To address this, we leverage a multidata causal discovery\nframework with a replicated dataset based on Statistical Hurricane Intensity\nPrediction Scheme (SHIPS) using ERA5 meteorological reanalysis. We conduct\nmultiple experiments to identify and select predictors causally linked to\nhurricane intensity changes. We train multiple linear regression models to\ncompare causal feature selection with no selection, correlation, and random\nforest feature importance across five forecast lead times from 1 to 5 days (24\nto 120 hours). Causal feature selection consistently outperforms on unseen test\ncases, especially for lead times shorter than 3 days. The causal features\nprimarily include vertical shear, mid-tropospheric potential vorticity and\nsurface moisture conditions, which are physically significant yet often\nunderutilized in hurricane intensity predictions. Further, we build an extended\npredictor set (SHIPS+) by adding selected features to the standard SHIPS\npredictors. SHIPS+ yields increased short-term predictive skill at lead times\nof 24, 48, and 72 hours. Adding nonlinearity using multilayer perceptron\nfurther extends skill to longer lead times, despite our framework being purely\nregional and not requiring global forecast data. Operational SHIPS tests\nconfirm that three of the six added causally discovered predictors improve\nforecasts, with the largest gains at longer lead times. Our results demonstrate\nthat causal discovery improves hurricane intensity prediction and pave the way\ntoward more empirical forecasts."}

Specifically, even on simple jigsaw tasks,\nexisting VLMs perform near randomly, revealing deficiencies in core perception\nand reasoning capabilities. While high-quality vision-language data can enhance\nthese capabilities, its scarcity and limited scalability impose significant\nconstraints. To address this, we propose AGILE, an Agentic jiGsaw Interaction\nLearning for Enhancing visual perception and reasoning in VLMs. AGILE\nformulates jigsaw solving as an interactive process, enabling the model to\nprogressively engage with the environment. At each step, the model generates\nexecutable code to perform an action based on the current state, while the\nenvironment provides fine-grained visual feedback to guide task completion.\nThrough this iterative cycle of observation and interaction, the model\nincrementally improves its perceptual and reasoning capabilities via\nexploration and feedback. Experimental results show that AGILE not only\nsubstantially boosts performance on jigsaw tasks of varying complexity (e.g.,\nincreasing accuracy from 9.5% to 82.8% under the 2 $\\times$ 2 setting) but also\ndemonstrates strong generalization across 9 general vision tasks, achieving an\naverage improvement of 3.1%. These results indicate notable enhancements in\nboth perceptual and reasoning abilities.

We\nstudy privacy-preserving sequential learning, where agents add endogenous noise\nto their reported actions to conceal private signals. Efficient social learning\nrelies on information flow, seemingly in conflict with privacy. Surprisingly,\nwith continuous signals and a fixed privacy budget $(\\epsilon)$, the optimal\nrandomization strategy balances privacy and accuracy, accelerating learning to\n$\\Theta_{\\epsilon}(\\log n)$, faster than the nonprivate $\\Theta(\\sqrt{\\log n})$\nrate. In the nonprivate baseline, the expected time to the first correct action\nand the number of incorrect actions diverge; under privacy with sufficiently\nsmall $\\epsilon$, both are finite. Privacy helps because, under the false\nstate, agents more often receive signals contradicting the majority;\nrandomization then asymmetrically amplifies the log-likelihood ratio, enhancing\naggregation. In heterogeneous populations, an order-optimal $\\Theta(\\sqrt{n})$\nrate is achievable when a subset of agents have low privacy budgets. With\nbinary signals, however, privacy reduces informativeness and impairs learning\nrelative to the nonprivate baseline, though the dependence on $\\epsilon$ is\nnonmonotone. Our results show how privacy reshapes information dynamics and\ninform the design of platforms and policies."}

Using these tools,\nwe prove asymptotic stability of TVFJ dynamics under infinitely recurring DTGs,\nexponential stability in semi-periodic defected networks, and asymptotic\nstability of a trust-based extension under the weaker condition of recurring\nWDTGs. We also establish boundedness of the omega-limit set, showing that\nlong-run opinions remain within the convex hull of innate beliefs, and\ncharacterize the limit set for periodically switching systems via a p-LTI\ndecomposition with the tight bound that the size of the omega-limit set is at\nmost p.

The proposed adaptive inflation reduces\nthe conservativeness of the controller compared to traditional fixed-ellipsoid\nobstacle formulations. The MPC solution provides an approximate motion plan,\nand high-order CBFs ensure the vessel's safety using the varying inflation\nradius. Simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that the proposed\nstrategy enables the fully-actuated autonomous robot vessel to navigate through\nnarrow spaces in real time and resolve potential deadlocks, all while ensuring\nsafety."}

Large language models (LLMs) excel at interpreting such\ninstructions but are prohibitively expensive to deploy at scale, while\ntraditional pipelines of classifiers and extractors remain efficient yet\nbrittle and unable to generalize to new tasks. We introduce Falconer, a\ncollaborative framework that combines the agentic reasoning of LLMs with\nlightweight proxy models for scalable knowledge mining. In Falconer, LLMs act\nas planners, decomposing user instructions into executable pipelines, and as\nannotators, generating supervision to train small proxies. The framework\nunifies classification and extraction into two atomic operations, get label and\nget span, enabling a single instruction-following model to replace multiple\ntask-specific components. To evaluate the consistency between proxy models\nincubated by Falconer and annotations provided by humans and large models, we\nconstruct new benchmarks covering both planning and end-to-end execution.\nExperiments show that Falconer closely matches state-of-the-art LLMs in\ninstruction-following accuracy while reducing inference cost by up to 90% and\naccelerating large-scale knowledge mining by more than 20x, offering an\nefficient and scalable foundation for Deep Research."}

While prior studies have investigated actuator-aware\ncontrol for conventional and fixed-tilt multirotors, these approaches rely on\nlinear relationships between actuator input and wrench, which cannot capture\nthe nonlinearities induced by variable tilt angles. In this work, we exploit\nthe cascade structure between the rigid-body dynamics of the multirotor and its\nnonlinear actuator dynamics to design the proposed backstepping controller and\nestablish exponential stability of the overall system. Furthermore, we reveal\nparametric uncertainty in the actuator model through experiments, and we\ndemonstrate that the proposed controller remains robust against such\nuncertainty. The controller was compared against a baseline that does not\naccount for actuator dynamics across three experimental scenarios: fast\ntranslational tracking, rapid rotational tracking, and recovery from sudden\ndisturbance. The proposed method consistently achieved better tracking\nperformance, and notably, while the baseline diverged and crashed during the\nfastest translational trajectory tracking and the recovery experiment, the\nproposed controller maintained stability and successfully completed the tasks,\nthereby demonstrating its effectiveness."}

Yet, beyond isolated media reports of severe\nconsequences, like reinforcing delusions, little is known about the extent of\nsycophancy or how it affects people who use AI. Here we show the pervasiveness\nand harmful impacts of sycophancy when people seek advice from AI. First,\nacross 11 state-of-the-art AI models, we find that models are highly\nsycophantic: they affirm users' actions 50% more than humans do, and they do so\neven in cases where user queries mention manipulation, deception, or other\nrelational harms. Second, in two preregistered experiments (N = 1604),\nincluding a live-interaction study where participants discuss a real\ninterpersonal conflict from their life, we find that interaction with\nsycophantic AI models significantly reduced participants' willingness to take\nactions to repair interpersonal conflict, while increasing their conviction of\nbeing in the right. However, participants rated sycophantic responses as higher\nquality, trusted the sycophantic AI model more, and were more willing to use it\nagain. This suggests that people are drawn to AI that unquestioningly validate,\neven as that validation risks eroding their judgment and reducing their\ninclination toward prosocial behavior. These preferences create perverse\nincentives both for people to increasingly rely on sycophantic AI models and\nfor AI model training to favor sycophancy. Our findings highlight the necessity\nof explicitly addressing this incentive structure to mitigate the widespread\nrisks of AI sycophancy."}

Current reinforcement learning approaches often rely on sparse,\noutcome-based rewards, which can reinforce flawed reasoning paths that lead to\ncoincidentally correct answers. We argue that this stems from a fundamental\nmismatch with the natural structure of reasoning. We first propose a\ntheoretical framework that formalizes complex problem solving as a hierarchical\nselection process, where an intractable global constraint is decomposed into a\nseries of simpler, localized logical steps. This framework provides a\nprincipled foundation for algorithm design, including theoretical insights into\nthe identifiability of this latent reasoning structure. Motivated by this\ntheory, we identify unstructured refinement -- a failure mode where a model's\niterative steps do not contribute meaningfully to the solution -- as a core\ndeficiency in existing methods. We then introduce Step-Aware Policy\nOptimization (SAPO), a novel RL algorithm that aligns the dLLM's denoising\nprocess with the latent reasoning hierarchy. By using a process-based reward\nfunction that encourages incremental progress, SAPO guides the model to learn\nstructured, coherent reasoning paths.

To mitigate the effect of simulator inductive\nbias, the key idea is to train policies jointly across multiple simulators,\nencouraging the learned controller to capture dynamics that generalize beyond\nany single simulator's assumptions.

Yet, their potential in applications requiring cognitive abilities,\nsuch as psychological counseling, remains largely untapped. This paper\ninvestigates the key question: Can LLMs be effectively applied to psychological\ncounseling? To determine whether an LLM can effectively take on the role of a\npsychological counselor, the first step is to assess whether it meets the\nqualifications required for such a role, namely the ability to pass the U.S.\nNational Counselor Certification Exam (NCE). This is because, just as a human\ncounselor must pass a certification exam to practice, an LLM must demonstrate\nsufficient psychological knowledge to meet the standards required for such a\nrole. To address this, we introduce PsychoBench, a benchmark grounded in\nU.S.national counselor examinations, a licensure test for professional\ncounselors that requires about 70% accuracy to pass. PsychoBench comprises\napproximately 2,252 carefully curated single-choice questions, crafted to\nrequire deep understanding and broad enough to cover various sub-disciplines of\npsychology. This benchmark provides a comprehensive assessment of an LLM's\nability to function as a counselor. Our evaluation shows that advanced models\nsuch as GPT-4o, Llama3.3-70B, and Gemma3-27B achieve well above the passing\nthreshold, while smaller open-source models (e.g., Qwen2.5-7B, Mistral-7B)\nremain far below it.

Knowledge graphs address these challenges\nby structuring mass spectrometry data, metabolite information, and their\nrelationships into a connected network (Gaudry et al. 2024). However, effective\nuse of a knowledge graph demands an in-depth understanding of its ontology and\nits query language syntax. To overcome this, we designed MetaboT, an AI system\nutilizing large language models (LLMs) to translate user questions into SPARQL\nsemantic query language for operating on knowledge graphs (Steve Harris 2013).\nWe demonstrate its effectiveness using the Experimental Natural Products\nKnowledge Graph (ENPKG), a large-scale public knowledge graph for plant natural\nproducts (Gaudry et al. 2024).MetaboT employs specialized AI agents for\nhandling user queries and interacting with the knowledge graph by breaking down\ncomplex tasks into discrete components, each managed by a specialised agent\n(Fig. 1a). The multi-agent system is constructed using the LangChain and\nLangGraph libraries, which facilitate the integration of LLMs with external\ntools and information sources (LangChain, n.d.). The query generation process\nfollows a structured workflow. First, the Entry Agent determines if the\nquestion is new or a follow-up to previous interactions. New questions are\nforwarded to the Validator Agent, which verifies if the question is related to\nthe knowledge graph. Then, the valid question is sent to the Supervisor Agent,\nwhich identifies if the question requires chemical conversions or standardized\nidentifiers. In this case it delegates the question to the Knowledge Graph\nAgent, which can use tools to extract necessary details, such as URIs or\ntaxonomies of chemical names, from the user query. Finally, an agent\nresponsible for crafting the SPARQL queries equipped with the ontology of the\nknowledge graph uses the provided identifiers to generate the query. Then, the\nsystem executes the generated query against the metabolomics knowledge graph\nand returns structured results to the user (Fig. 1b). To assess the performance\nof MetaboT we have curated 50 metabolomics-related questions and their expected\nanswers. In addition to submitting these questions to MetaboT, we evaluated a\nbaseline by submitting them to a standard LLM (GPT-4o) with a prompt that\nincorporated the knowledge graph ontology but did not provide specific entity\nIDs. This baseline achieved only 8.16% accuracy, compared to MetaboT's 83.67%,\nunderscoring the necessity of our multi-agent system for accurately retrieving\nentities and generating correct SPARQL queries. MetaboT demonstrates promising\nperformance as a conversational question-answering assistant, enabling\nresearchers to retrieve structured metabolomics data through natural language\nqueries. By automating the generation and execution of SPARQL queries, it\nremoves technical barriers that have traditionally hindered access to knowledge\ngraphs. Importantly, MetaboT leverages the capabilities of LLMs while\nmaintaining experimentally grounded query generation, ensuring that outputs\nremain aligned with domain-specific standards and data structures. This\napproach facilitates data-driven discoveries by bridging the gap between\ncomplex semantic technologies and user-friendly interaction.

While existing discourse often emphasizes either the\npromise and peril of AI or its immediate implementation, this paper advances a\nthird path: a principled framework for guiding the use of AI in teaching and\nlearning. Drawing on decades of scholarship in the learning sciences and uses\nof technology in education, I articulate a set of principles that connect broad\nour educational goalsto actionable practices. These principles clarify the\nrespective roles of educators, learners, and technologies in shaping curricula,\ndesigning instruction, assessing learning, and cultivating community. The piece\nillustrates how a principled approach enables higher education to harness new\ntools while preserving its fundamental mission: advancing meaningful learning,\nsupporting democratic societies, and preparing students for dynamic futures.\nUltimately, this framework seeks to ensure that AI augments rather than\ndisplaces human capacities, aligning technology use with enduring educational\nvalues and goals."}

We propose Lateral Tree-of-Thoughts\n(LToT), a drop-in controller that separates utility from logical consistency\nand treats low-utility but consistent candidates as assets rather than waste.\nThe frontier is split into mainlines (high-utility candidates used for\nexploitation) and laterals (consistent, initially low-utility candidates that\nreceive short, cheap probes before judgment). LToT explores laterals via\nLateral Racing with Short-Circuit (LR--SC): a capped successive-halving race\nthat spreads tiny probes across a very wide lateral set, uses width-aware\nthresholds with repeat-to-confirm, and immediately promotes a branch once its\nenvelope clears the mainline bar; mainlines are kept intentionally narrow so\nsurplus compute is invested where width is cheap.

These two context representations transform the problem\nfrom inference over long-form guidelines into a compact grounded evaluation.\nEvaluated on four multi-domain benchmarks against four baselines, LogT improves\noverall performance by 11.84% across all LLMs. Performance improves\nsignificantly across all three modes of reasoning: by up to +10.2% on negation,\n+13.2% on implication, and +5.5% on defeasible reasoning compared to the\nstrongest baseline."}

This paper investigates the shrinkage issue of RLVR by\nanalyzing its learning dynamics and reveals two critical phenomena that explain\nthis failure. First, we expose negative interference in RLVR, where learning to\nsolve certain training problems actively reduces the likelihood of correct\nsolutions for others, leading to the decline of Pass@$k$ performance, or the\nprobability of generating a correct solution within $k$ attempts. Second, we\nuncover the winner-take-all phenomenon: RLVR disproportionately reinforces\nproblems with high likelihood, correct solutions, under the base model, while\nsuppressing other initially low-likelihood ones. Through extensive theoretical\nand empirical analysis on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, we show\nthat this effect arises from the inherent on-policy sampling in standard RL\nobjectives, causing the model to converge toward narrow solution strategies.\nBased on these insights, we propose a simple yet effective data curation\nalgorithm that focuses RLVR learning on low-likelihood problems, achieving\nnotable improvement in Pass@$k$ performance.

To address more effective reasoning, we\nintroduce reasoning abstractions: concise natural language descriptions of\nprocedural and factual knowledge that guide the model toward learning\nsuccessful reasoning. We train models to be capable of proposing multiple\nabstractions given a problem, followed by RL that incentivizes building a\nsolution while using the information provided by these abstractions.

However, the limited availability of large labeled\ndatasets presents challenges for training models tailored to specific tasks and\nmodalities of interest.

Yet, their potential in applications requiring cognitive abilities,\nsuch as psychological counseling, remains largely untapped. This paper\ninvestigates the key question: Can LLMs be effectively applied to psychological\ncounseling? To determine whether an LLM can effectively take on the role of a\npsychological counselor, the first step is to assess whether it meets the\nqualifications required for such a role, namely the ability to pass the U.S.\nNational Counselor Certification Exam (NCE). This is because, just as a human\ncounselor must pass a certification exam to practice, an LLM must demonstrate\nsufficient psychological knowledge to meet the standards required for such a\nrole. To address this, we introduce PsychoBench, a benchmark grounded in\nU.S.national counselor examinations, a licensure test for professional\ncounselors that requires about 70% accuracy to pass. PsychoBench comprises\napproximately 2,252 carefully curated single-choice questions, crafted to\nrequire deep understanding and broad enough to cover various sub-disciplines of\npsychology.

Considering actuator dynamics is essential for more effective and\nreliable operation, particularly during aggressive flight maneuvers or recovery\nfrom sudden disturbances. While prior studies have investigated actuator-aware\ncontrol for conventional and fixed-tilt multirotors, these approaches rely on\nlinear relationships between actuator input and wrench, which cannot capture\nthe nonlinearities induced by variable tilt angles.

Knowledge graphs address these challenges\nby structuring mass spectrometry data, metabolite information, and their\nrelationships into a connected network (Gaudry et al. 2024). However, effective\nuse of a knowledge graph demands an in-depth understanding of its ontology and\nits query language syntax. To overcome this, we designed MetaboT, an AI system\nutilizing large language models (LLMs) to translate user questions into SPARQL\nsemantic query language for operating on knowledge graphs (Steve Harris 2013).\nWe demonstrate its effectiveness using the Experimental Natural Products\nKnowledge Graph (ENPKG), a large-scale public knowledge graph for plant natural\nproducts (Gaudry et al. 2024).MetaboT employs specialized AI agents for\nhandling user queries and interacting with the knowledge graph by breaking down\ncomplex tasks into discrete components, each managed by a specialised agent\n(Fig. 1a). The multi-agent system is constructed using the LangChain and\nLangGraph libraries, which facilitate the integration of LLMs with external\ntools and information sources (LangChain, n.d.). The query generation process\nfollows a structured workflow. First, the Entry Agent determines if the\nquestion is new or a follow-up to previous interactions. New questions are\nforwarded to the Validator Agent, which verifies if the question is related to\nthe knowledge graph. Then, the valid question is sent to the Supervisor Agent,\nwhich identifies if the question requires chemical conversions or standardized\nidentifiers. In this case it delegates the question to the Knowledge Graph\nAgent, which can use tools to extract necessary details, such as URIs or\ntaxonomies of chemical names, from the user query. Finally, an agent\nresponsible for crafting the SPARQL queries equipped with the ontology of the\nknowledge graph uses the provided identifiers to generate the query. Then, the\nsystem executes the generated query against the metabolomics knowledge graph\nand returns structured results to the user (Fig. 1b). To assess the performance\nof MetaboT we have curated 50 metabolomics-related questions and their expected\nanswers. In addition to submitting these questions to MetaboT, we evaluated a\nbaseline by submitting them to a standard LLM (GPT-4o) with a prompt that\nincorporated the knowledge graph ontology but did not provide specific entity\nIDs. This baseline achieved only 8.16% accuracy, compared to MetaboT's 83.67%,\nunderscoring the necessity of our multi-agent system for accurately retrieving\nentities and generating correct SPARQL queries. MetaboT demonstrates promising\nperformance as a conversational question-answering assistant, enabling\nresearchers to retrieve structured metabolomics data through natural language\nqueries. By automating the generation and execution of SPARQL queries, it\nremoves technical barriers that have traditionally hindered access to knowledge\ngraphs. Importantly, MetaboT leverages the capabilities of LLMs while\nmaintaining experimentally grounded query generation, ensuring that outputs\nremain aligned with domain-specific standards and data structures. This\napproach facilitates data-driven discoveries by bridging the gap between\ncomplex semantic technologies and user-friendly interaction.

Existing\napproaches, such as tree-based algorithms and reinforcement learning (RL),\nattempt to address this issue but suffer from high computational costs and\noften fail to produce optimal reasoning trajectories. To tackle this challenge,\nwe propose Plan-Then-Action Enhanced Reasoning with Group Relative Policy\nOptimization PTA-GRPO, a two-stage framework designed to improve both\nhigh-level planning and fine-grained CoT reasoning. In the first stage, we\nleverage advanced LLMs to distill CoT into compact high-level guidance, which\nis then used for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). In the second stage, we\nintroduce a guidance-aware RL method that jointly optimizes the final output\nand the quality of high-level guidance, thereby enhancing reasoning\neffectiveness. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple mathematical\nreasoning benchmarks, including MATH, AIME2024, AIME2025, and AMC, across\ndiverse base models such as Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, Qwen3-8B, Qwen3-14B, and\nLLaMA3.2-3B. Experimental results demonstrate that PTA-GRPO consistently\nachieves stable and significant improvements across different models and tasks,\nvalidating its effectiveness and generalization."}

The notion of the feasible operating\nregion (FOR), defined in the PQ domain, has emerged as a promising\nprivacy-preserving approach. However, effectively leveraging FOR in TSO\noperations remains challenging due to three key factors: its accurate\ndetermination in large-scale, meshed DS networks; its tractable analytical\nrepresentation; and its economic valuation. In the present paper, we propose a\nnovel AC optimal power flow (OPF)-based method to construct a three-dimensional\nPQV-FOR, explicitly accounting for voltage variability and diverse\nflexibility-providing unit (FPU) characteristics. The construction process\nemploys a two-stage sampling strategy that combines bounding box projection and\nFibonacci direction techniques to efficiently capture the FOR. We then\nintroduce an implicit polynomial fitting approach to analytically represent the\nFOR. Furthermore, we derive a quadratic cost function over the PQV domain to\nmonetize the FOR. Thus, the proposed framework enables single-round TSO-DSO\ncoordination: the DSO provides an analytical FOR and cost model; the TSO\ndetermines operating point at the point of common coupling (PCC) within the\nFOR-based AC-OPF; and the DSO computes FPU dispatch by solving its local OPF,\nwithout computationally intensive disaggregation or iterative coordination.\nCase studies on meshed DS with up to 533 buses, integrated into TS,\ndemonstrates the method's efficiency compared to standard AC-OPF.

Assuming the reproduction number for each virus is the same, we identify\nsuitable parameter regimes that give rise to lines of coexistence equilibria.\nMoreover, we also identify conditions for local exponential stability of said\nlines of equilibria. We illustrate our findings with several numerical\nsimulations."}

Although biosignal modalities differ in functionality, signal fidelity,\nsensor comfort, and cost, they are often intercorrelated, reflecting the\nholistic and interconnected nature of human physiology. This opens up the\npossibility of performing the same tasks using alternative biosignal\nmodalities, thereby improving the accessibility, usability, and adaptability of\nhealth monitoring systems. However, the limited availability of large labeled\ndatasets presents challenges for training models tailored to specific tasks and\nmodalities of interest. Unsupervised cross-modal knowledge transfer offers a\npromising solution by leveraging knowledge from an existing modality to support\nmodel training for a new modality. Existing methods are typically based on\nknowledge distillation, which requires running a teacher model alongside\nstudent model training, resulting in high computational and memory overhead.\nThis challenge is further exacerbated by the recent development of foundation\nmodels that demonstrate superior performance and generalization across tasks at\nthe cost of large model sizes. To this end, we explore a new framework for\nunsupervised cross-modal knowledge transfer of biosignals by training a\nlightweight bridge network to align the intermediate representations and enable\ninformation flow between foundation models and across modalities. Specifically,\nwe introduce an efficient strategy for selecting alignment positions where the\nbridge should be constructed, along with a flexible prototype network as the\nbridge architecture. Extensive experiments across multiple biosignal\nmodalities, tasks, and datasets show that BioX-Bridge reduces the number of\ntrainable parameters by 88--99\\% while maintaining or even improving transfer\nperformance compared to state-of-the-art methods."}

However, pretrained policies usually perform poorly without\nsufficient in-domain data. Besides, human-collected demonstrations entail\nsubstantial labour and tend to encompass mixed-quality data and redundant\ninformation. As a workaround, human-in-the-loop systems gather domain-specific\ndata for policy post-training, and exploit closed-loop policy feedback to offer\ninformative guidance, but usually require full-time human surveillance during\npolicy rollout. In this work, we devise ARMADA, a multi-robot deployment and\nadaptation system with human-in-the-loop shared control, featuring an\nautonomous online failure detection method named FLOAT. Thanks to FLOAT, ARMADA\nenables paralleled policy rollout and requests human intervention only when\nnecessary, significantly reducing reliance on human supervision. Hence, ARMADA\nenables efficient acquisition of in-domain data, and leads to more scalable\ndeployment and faster adaptation to new scenarios. We evaluate the performance\nof ARMADA on four real-world tasks. FLOAT achieves nearly 95% accuracy on\naverage, surpassing prior state-of-the-art failure detection approaches by over\n20%.

We\nstudy privacy-preserving sequential learning, where agents add endogenous noise\nto their reported actions to conceal private signals. Efficient social learning\nrelies on information flow, seemingly in conflict with privacy. Surprisingly,\nwith continuous signals and a fixed privacy budget $(\\epsilon)$, the optimal\nrandomization strategy balances privacy and accuracy, accelerating learning to\n$\\Theta_{\\epsilon}(\\log n)$, faster than the nonprivate $\\Theta(\\sqrt{\\log n})$\nrate. In the nonprivate baseline, the expected time to the first correct action\nand the number of incorrect actions diverge; under privacy with sufficiently\nsmall $\\epsilon$, both are finite. Privacy helps because, under the false\nstate, agents more often receive signals contradicting the majority;\nrandomization then asymmetrically amplifies the log-likelihood ratio, enhancing\naggregation. In heterogeneous populations, an order-optimal $\\Theta(\\sqrt{n})$\nrate is achievable when a subset of agents have low privacy budgets. With\nbinary signals, however, privacy reduces informativeness and impairs learning\nrelative to the nonprivate baseline, though the dependence on $\\epsilon$ is\nnonmonotone. Our results show how privacy reshapes information dynamics and\ninform the design of platforms and policies."}

We conduct laboratory-style experiments using large\nlanguage models to replicate classic studies on herd behavior in trading\ndecisions. Our results show that AI agents make more rational decisions than\nhumans, relying predominantly on private information over market trends.\nIncreased reliance on AI-powered trading advice could therefore potentially\nlead to fewer asset price bubbles arising from animal spirits that trade by\nfollowing the herd. However, exploring variations in the experimental settings\nreveals that AI agents can be induced to herd optimally when explicitly guided\nto make profit-maximizing decisions. While optimal herding improves market\ndiscipline, this behavior still carries potential implications for financial\nstability. In other experimental variations, we show that AI agents are not\npurely algorithmic, but have inherited some elements of human conditioning and\nbias."}

Conventional methods prioritize correlation or fit, often\noverlooking confounding variables and limiting generalizability to unseen\ntropical storms. To address this, we leverage a multidata causal discovery\nframework with a replicated dataset based on Statistical Hurricane Intensity\nPrediction Scheme (SHIPS) using ERA5 meteorological reanalysis. We conduct\nmultiple experiments to identify and select predictors causally linked to\nhurricane intensity changes. We train multiple linear regression models to\ncompare causal feature selection with no selection, correlation, and random\nforest feature importance across five forecast lead times from 1 to 5 days (24\nto 120 hours). Causal feature selection consistently outperforms on unseen test\ncases, especially for lead times shorter than 3 days. The causal features\nprimarily include vertical shear, mid-tropospheric potential vorticity and\nsurface moisture conditions, which are physically significant yet often\nunderutilized in hurricane intensity predictions. Further, we build an extended\npredictor set (SHIPS+) by adding selected features to the standard SHIPS\npredictors. SHIPS+ yields increased short-term predictive skill at lead times\nof 24, 48, and 72 hours. Adding nonlinearity using multilayer perceptron\nfurther extends skill to longer lead times, despite our framework being purely\nregional and not requiring global forecast data. Operational SHIPS tests\nconfirm that three of the six added causally discovered predictors improve\nforecasts, with the largest gains at longer lead times. Our results demonstrate\nthat causal discovery improves hurricane intensity prediction and pave the way\ntoward more empirical forecasts."}

This task is especially critical in fast-moving fields\nsuch as artificial intelligence (AI), yet it has become increasingly difficult\ngiven the rapid growth of submissions. In this paper, we investigate an\nunderexplored measure for identifying high-impact research: authors' own\nrankings of their multiple submissions to the same AI conference. Grounded in\ngame-theoretic reasoning, we hypothesize that self-rankings are informative\nbecause authors possess unique understanding of their work's conceptual depth\nand long-term promise. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a large-scale\nexperiment at a leading AI conference, where 1,342 researchers self-ranked\ntheir 2,592 submissions by perceived quality. Tracking outcomes over more than\na year, we found that papers ranked highest by their authors received twice as\nmany citations as their lowest-ranked counterparts; self-rankings were\nespecially effective at identifying highly cited papers (those with over 150\ncitations). Moreover, we showed that self-rankings outperformed peer review\nscores in predicting future citation counts.
