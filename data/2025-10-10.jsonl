It pulls products toward a shared\ntemplate, making offerings look and feel more alike while making true\noriginality disproportionately expensive. We capture this centripetal force in\na standard two-stage differentiated-competition framework and show how a single\ncapability shift simultaneously compresses perceived differences, lowers\nmarginal cost and raises fixed access costs. The intuition is straightforward.\nWhen buyers see smaller differences across products, the payoff to standing\napart shrinks just as the effort to do so rises, so firms cluster around the\ntemplate. Prices fall and customers become more willing to switch. But the same\nhomogenization also squeezes operating margins, and rising fixed outlays deepen\nthe squeeze. The combination yields a structural prediction. There is a\ncapability threshold at which even two firms cannot both cover fixed costs, and\nin a many-firm extension the sustainable number of firms falls as capability\ngrows. Concentration increases, and prices still fall. Our results hold under\nbroader preference shapes, non-uniform consumer densities, outside options,\ncapability-dependent curvatures, and modest asymmetries. We translate the\ntheory into two sufficient statistics for enforcement. On the one hand, a\nconduct statistic and a viability statistic. Transactions or platform rules\nthat strengthen template pull or raise fixed access and originality costs can\nlower prices today yet push the market toward monoculture. Remedies that\nbroaden access and promote template plurality and interoperability preserve the\nprice benefits of AI while protecting entry and variety.

It pulls products toward a shared\ntemplate, making offerings look and feel more alike while making true\noriginality disproportionately expensive. We capture this centripetal force in\na standard two-stage differentiated-competition framework and show how a single\ncapability shift simultaneously compresses perceived differences, lowers\nmarginal cost and raises fixed access costs. The intuition is straightforward.\nWhen buyers see smaller differences across products, the payoff to standing\napart shrinks just as the effort to do so rises, so firms cluster around the\ntemplate. Prices fall and customers become more willing to switch. But the same\nhomogenization also squeezes operating margins, and rising fixed outlays deepen\nthe squeeze. The combination yields a structural prediction. There is a\ncapability threshold at which even two firms cannot both cover fixed costs, and\nin a many-firm extension the sustainable number of firms falls as capability\ngrows. Concentration increases, and prices still fall. Our results hold under\nbroader preference shapes, non-uniform consumer densities, outside options,\ncapability-dependent curvatures, and modest asymmetries. We translate the\ntheory into two sufficient statistics for enforcement. On the one hand, a\nconduct statistic and a viability statistic. Transactions or platform rules\nthat strengthen template pull or raise fixed access and originality costs can\nlower prices today yet push the market toward monoculture. Remedies that\nbroaden access and promote template plurality and interoperability preserve the\nprice benefits of AI while protecting entry and variety. The paper thus\nreconciles a live policy paradox. AI can make prices lower and entry harder at\nthe same time. It prescribes what to measure to tell which force is dominant in\npractice."}

A challenge in analyzing\ncircadian biology data is that the oscillation peak and trough times for a\nphenomenon differ across individuals. If these individual-level differences are\nnot accounted for in trigonometric regression, which is prevalent in circadian\nbiology studies, then estimates of the population-level amplitude parameters\ncan suffer from attenuation bias. This attenuation bias could lead to\ninaccurate study conclusions. To address attenuation bias, we propose a refined\ntwo-stage (RTS) method for trigonometric regression given longitudinal data\nobtained from each individual participating in a study. In the first stage, the\nparameters of individual-level models are estimated. In the second stage,\ntransformations of these individual-level estimates are aggregated to produce\npopulation-level parameter estimates for inference. Simulation studies show\nthat our RTS method mitigates bias in parameter estimation, obtains greater\nstatistical power, and maintains appropriate type I error control when compared\nto the standard two-stage (STS) method, which ignores individual-level\ndifferences in peak and trough times. The only exception for parameter\nestimation and statistical power occurs when the oscillation amplitudes are\nweak relative to random variability in the data and the sample size is small.\nIllustrations with cortisol level data and heart rate data show that our RTS\nmethod obtains larger population-level amplitude parameter estimates and\nsmaller $p$-values for multiple hypothesis tests when compared to the STS\nmethod."}

As such, we present GATO, an open\nsource, GPU-accelerated, batched TO solver co-designed across algorithm,\nsoftware, and computational hardware to deliver real-time throughput for these\nmoderate batch size regimes. Our approach leverages a combination of block-,\nwarp-, and thread-level parallelism within and across solves for ultra-high\nperformance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a\ncombination of: simulated benchmarks showing speedups of 18-21x over CPU\nbaselines and 1.4-16x over GPU baselines as batch size increases; case studies\nhighlighting improved disturbance rejection and convergence behavior; and\nfinally a validation on hardware using an industrial manipulator.

To study how these failures\naffect safety, researchers typically inject artificial faults into hardware or\nsoftware components and observe the outcomes. However, existing fault injection\nstudies often target a single sensor or machine perception (MP) module,\nresulting in siloed frameworks that are difficult to generalize or integrate\ninto unified simulation environments. This work addresses that limitation by\nreframing perception failures as hallucinations, false perceptions that distort\nan AV situational awareness and may trigger unsafe control actions. Since\nhallucinations describe only observable effects, this abstraction enables\nanalysis independent of specific sensors or algorithms, focusing instead on how\ntheir faults manifest along the MP pipeline. Building on this concept, we\npropose a configurable, component-agnostic hallucination injection framework\nthat induces six plausible hallucination types in an iterative open-source\nsimulator. More than 18,350 simulations were executed in which hallucinations\nwere injected while AVs crossed an unsignalized transverse street with traffic.\nThe results statistically validate the framework and quantify the impact of\neach hallucination type on collisions and near misses. Certain hallucinations,\nsuch as perceptual latency and drift, significantly increase the risk of\ncollision in the scenario tested, validating the proposed paradigm can stress\nthe AV system safety. The framework offers a scalable, statistically validated,\ncomponent agnostic, and fully interoperable toolset that simplifies and\naccelerates AV safety validations, even those with novel MP architectures and\ncomponents.

This paper introduces\nL2M-AID, a novel framework for Autonomous Industrial Defense using\nLLM-empowered, Multi-agent reinforcement learning. L2M-AID orchestrates a team\nof collaborative agents, each driven by a Large Language Model (LLM), to\nachieve adaptive and resilient security. The core innovation lies in the deep\nfusion of two AI paradigms: we leverage an LLM as a semantic bridge to\ntranslate vast, unstructured telemetry into a rich, contextual state\nrepresentation, enabling agents to reason about adversary intent rather than\nmerely matching patterns. This semantically-aware state empowers a Multi-Agent\nReinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithm, MAPPO, to learn complex cooperative\nstrategies. The MARL reward function is uniquely engineered to balance security\nobjectives (threat neutralization) with operational imperatives, explicitly\npenalizing actions that disrupt physical process stability. To validate our\napproach, we conduct extensive experiments on the benchmark SWaT dataset and a\nnovel synthetic dataset generated based on the MITRE ATT&CK for ICS framework.\nResults demonstrate that L2M-AID significantly outperforms traditional IDS,\ndeep learning anomaly detectors, and single-agent RL baselines across key\nmetrics, achieving a 97.2% detection rate while reducing false positives by\nover 80% and improving response times by a factor of four. Crucially, it\ndemonstrates superior performance in maintaining physical process stability,\npresenting a robust new paradigm for securing critical national infrastructure."}

TESTAM+\nachieves significant improvements over TESTAM: 1.3% MAE reduction on METR LA\n(3.10 vs. 3.14) and 4.1% improvement on PEMS BAY (1.65 vs. 1.72). Through\ncomprehensive ablation studies, we discover that strategic expert selection\nfundamentally outperforms naive ensemble aggregation. Individual experts\ndemonstrate remarkable effectiveness: the Adaptive Expert achieves 1.63 MAE on\nPEMS BAY, outperforming the original three expert TESTAM (1.72 MAE), while the\nSpatioSemantic Expert matches this performance with identical 1.63 MAE. The\noptimal Identity + Adaptive configuration achieves an 11.5% MAE reduction\ncompared to state of the art MegaCRN on METR LA (2.99 vs. 3.38), while reducing\ninference latency by 53.1% compared to the full four expert TESTAM+.

Our\nmain idea is to generate multiple trajectories by considering different local\nconstraints at different basepoints. Then these multiple trajectories are fused\nto generate a smooth trajectory by our proposed weighted average mechanism,\nachieving the goal to incorporate multiple local constraints simultaneously.\nCompared with existing solution, ours can address the distortion issue and make\nthe off-theshelf Euclidean learning algorithm be re-applicable in non-Euclidean\nspace. Simulation and Experimental evaluations validate that our solution can\nnot only adapt orientations towards arbitrary desired via-points and cope with\nangular acceleration constraints, but also incorporate multiple local\nconstraints simultaneously to achieve extra benefits, e.g., achieving smaller\nacceleration costs."}

This adjustment enables\nSigLIP-B16 to surpass all previous results and GPT-4.1 to yield the first\nresult surpassing estimated human performance on Winoground.\n  Building on this insight, we propose Test-Time Matching (TTM), an iterative,\nself-improving algorithm that further bootstraps model performance without any\nexternal supervision. TTM delivers additional, non-trivial improvements: for\nexample, TTM enables SigLIP-B16 to surpass GPT-4.1 on MMVP-VLM, establishing a\nnew state of the art. Importantly, TTM remains broadly effective even on\nbenchmarks without metric-induced effects or group structures, achieving\nrelative gains up to 85.7% on challenging datasets such as WhatsUp. Across 16\ndataset variants spanning diverse setups, our experiments demonstrate that TTM\nconsistently improves model performance and advances the frontier of\ncompositional reasoning."}

This approach offers two main advantages: (1) it\nimproves training efficiency by fully utilizing every sample; (2) it enables\nthe model to emulate the problem solving strategy of the reference answer\nduring training, thereby enhancing generalization in reasoning. GCPO achieves\noutstanding results across multiple benchmark datasets, yielding substantial\nimprovements over the baseline model. Our code is available at:\nhttps://github.com/AchoWu/GCPO."}

As a result, most current agents rely on supervised fine-tuning on\nexpert data, which is challenging to scale and generalizes poorly. This\nlimitation stems from the nature of expert demonstrations: they capture only a\nnarrow range of scenarios and expose the agent to limited environment\ndiversity. We address this limitation with a middle-ground paradigm we call\nearly experience: interaction data generated by the agent's own actions, where\nthe resulting future states serve as supervision without reward signals. Within\nthis paradigm we study two strategies of using such data: (1) Implicit world\nmodeling, which uses collected states to ground the policy in environment\ndynamics; and (2) Self-reflection, where the agent learns from its suboptimal\nactions to improve reasoning and decision-making.

This highlights a practical engineering\npathway for leveraging silicon's immense manufacturing scalability, offering a\nlower-risk route to deployment compared to III-V materials.

This paper introduces\nL2M-AID, a novel framework for Autonomous Industrial Defense using\nLLM-empowered, Multi-agent reinforcement learning. L2M-AID orchestrates a team\nof collaborative agents, each driven by a Large Language Model (LLM), to\nachieve adaptive and resilient security. The core innovation lies in the deep\nfusion of two AI paradigms: we leverage an LLM as a semantic bridge to\ntranslate vast, unstructured telemetry into a rich, contextual state\nrepresentation, enabling agents to reason about adversary intent rather than\nmerely matching patterns. This semantically-aware state empowers a Multi-Agent\nReinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithm, MAPPO, to learn complex cooperative\nstrategies. The MARL reward function is uniquely engineered to balance security\nobjectives (threat neutralization) with operational imperatives, explicitly\npenalizing actions that disrupt physical process stability. To validate our\napproach, we conduct extensive experiments on the benchmark SWaT dataset and a\nnovel synthetic dataset generated based on the MITRE ATT&CK for ICS framework.\nResults demonstrate that L2M-AID significantly outperforms traditional IDS,\ndeep learning anomaly detectors, and single-agent RL baselines across key\nmetrics, achieving a 97.2% detection rate while reducing false positives by\nover 80% and improving response times by a factor of four. Crucially, it\ndemonstrates superior performance in maintaining physical process stability,\npresenting a robust new paradigm for securing critical national infrastructure."}

To ground our analysis, we introduce an\nunsupervised, bottom-up approach for uncovering human-interpretable reasoning\nbehaviors in thinking models. This approach provides an unbiased method to\ndiscover reasoning behaviors without imposing manual or LLM-derived\nassumptions. Across three base and four thinking models, using GSM8K and\nMATH500, our hybrid model recovers up to 91% of the performance gap to thinking\nmodels without any weight updates while steering only 12% of tokens.\nConcretely, our empirical setup provides a simple, causal way to test the\neffectiveness of existing reasoning mechanisms in base models by invoking them\ndirectly and measuring the resulting task performance.

While LoRA has achieved\nconsiderable empirical success, it still encounters challenges such as\nsuboptimal performance and slow convergence. To address these limitations, we\nintroduce \\textbf{AILoRA}, a novel parameter-efficient method that incorporates\nfunction-aware asymmetric low-rank priors. Our empirical analysis reveals that\nthe projection matrices $W^Q$ and $W^V$ in the self-attention mechanism exhibit\ndistinct parameter characteristics, stemming from their functional differences.\nSpecifically, $W^Q$ captures task-specific semantic space knowledge essential\nfor attention distributions computation, making its parameters highly sensitive\nto downstream task variations. In contrast, $W^V$ encodes token-level feature\nrepresentations that tend to remain stable across tasks and layers. Leveraging\nthese insights, AILoRA performs a function-aware initialization by injecting\nthe principal components of $W^Q$ to retain task-adaptive capacity, and the\nminor components of $W^V$ to preserve generalizable feature representations.\nThis asymmetric initialization strategy enables LoRA modules to better capture\nthe specialized roles of attention parameters, thereby enhancing both\nfinetuning performance and convergence efficiency."}

Although humans can solve these tasks\nwith ease, existing models, even after extensive pre-training and post-training\nat scale, still fail to perform reasoning reliably. In this paper, we revisit\nreasoning tasks from a causal perspective, seeking to understand their behavior\nin latent space and to offer insights for addressing their challenges.\nSpecifically, we cast reasoning tasks as a selection mechanism, in which\nhigh-level logical concepts function as selection operators on the given\nobservations, such as, identifying the correct answer in a math problem or\nfilling the appropriate entry in Sudoku. We emphasize two key properties of\nthis formulation that shed light on the difficulty of reasoning tasks. First,\nthe latent space exceeds the observation space in complexity, even when the\ncorrect answer is fully determined by the observed input. Second, the latent\nvariables, corresponding to logical thought, are densely structured and exhibit\nstrong dependencies. Building on this formulation, we introduce a framework,\ncalled SR$^2$, that incorporates the estimated latent variables as feedback\ninto the selection mechanism, thereby facilitating the learning of dense\ndependencies among latent representations. The framework consists of three key\nmodules: reflective representation learning, dependency self-refinement, and\nperiodic intermediate alignment. Experimentally, we show that our approach\nyields significant gains in reasoning accuracy, for example, attaining over\n10$\\%$ improvement in performance with 8$\\times$ fewer parameters on the Sudoku\nand Maze tasks over the recent advances."}

In this\nwork, we reveal the security and robustness vulnerabilities of these agents\nthrough backdoor attacks. Distinct from traditional backdoors limited to\nsingle-step control, we propose the Chain-of-Trigger Backdoor (CoTri), a\nmulti-step backdoor attack designed for long-horizon agentic control. CoTri\nrelies on an ordered sequence. It starts with an initial trigger, and\nsubsequent ones are drawn from the environment, allowing multi-step\nmanipulation that diverts the agent from its intended task. Experimental\nresults show that CoTri achieves a near-perfect attack success rate (ASR) while\nmaintaining a near-zero false trigger rate (FTR). Due to training data modeling\nthe stochastic nature of the environment, the implantation of CoTri\nparadoxically enhances the agent's performance on benign tasks and even\nimproves its robustness against environmental distractions. We further validate\nCoTri on vision-language models (VLMs), confirming its scalability to\nmultimodal agents.

In this paper, we formalize this problem and introduce Counterfactuals\nand Reasoning for Termination (CaRT), an approach for teaching LLMs when to\nstop seeking information. To appropriately learn when to terminate, CaRT\nfine-tunes LLMs using counterfactual pairs of trajectories, one where\ntermination is appropriate and a minimally modified version of the same\ntrajectory where it is not. It trains the LLM to explain the rationale for the\ntermination decision in either case via verbal reasoning, and imbues this\ncapability into the base LLM via fine-tuning.
