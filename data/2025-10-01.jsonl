However, when researchers have access to many\ncovariates at the experiment design stage, they often face challenges in\neffectively selecting or weighting covariates when creating their strata. This\npaper proposes a Generative Stratification procedure that leverages Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) to synthesize high-dimensional covariate data to improve\nexperimental design. We demonstrate the value of this approach by applying it\nto a set of experiments and find that our method would have reduced the\nvariance of the treatment effect estimate by 10%-50% compared to simple\nrandomization in our empirical applications. When combined with other standard\nstratification methods, it can be used to further improve the efficiency. Our\nresults demonstrate that LLM-based simulation is a practical and\neasy-to-implement way to improve experimental design in covariate-rich\nsettings."}

However, we document that only a limited number of empirical\nstudies explicitly address the external validity of standard RD effects. To\nadvance empirical practice, we propose a simple joint inference procedure for\nthe RD effect and its local external validity, building on Calonico, Cattaneo,\nand Titiunik (2014, Econometrica) and Dong and Lewbel (2015, Review of\nEconomics and Statistics). We further introduce a locally linear treatment\neffects assumption, which enhances the interpretability of the treatment effect\nderivative proposed by Dong and Lewbel. Under this assumption, we establish\nidentification and derive a uniform confidence band for the extrapolated\ntreatment effects. Our approaches require no additional covariates or design\nfeatures, making them applicable to virtually all RD settings and thereby\nenhancing the policy relevance of many empirical RD studies.

Dyad-level effects\nprovide a richer and more realistic representation of heterogeneity across\npairs of dimensions (e.g. importer-exporter, importer-product,\nexporter-product), yet their sheer number creates a severe incidental parameter\nproblem. We propose a novel ``hexad logit'' estimator and establish its\nconsistency and asymptotic normality. Identification is achieved through a\nconditional likelihood approach that eliminates the fixed effects by\nconditioning on sufficient statistics, in the form of hexads -- wirings that\ninvolve two nodes from each part of the network. Our central finding is that\ndyad-level heterogeneity fundamentally changes how information accumulates.\nUnlike under node-level heterogeneity, where informative wirings automatically\ngrow with link formation, under dyad-level heterogeneity the network may\ngenerate infinitely many links yet asymptotically zero informative wirings. We\nderive explicit sparsity thresholds that determine when consistency holds and\nwhen asymptotic normality is attainable.

To effectively automate the design and\noptimization of CIM-based neural network accelerators, hardware-aware neural\narchitecture search (HW-NAS) techniques can be applied. This work introduces\nCIMNAS, a joint model-quantization-hardware optimization framework for CIM\narchitectures. CIMNAS simultaneously searches across software parameters,\nquantization policies, and a broad range of hardware parameters, incorporating\ndevice-, circuit-, and architecture-level co-optimizations. CIMNAS experiments\nwere conducted over a search space of 9.9x10^85 potential parameter\ncombinations with the MobileNet model as a baseline and RRAM-based CIM\narchitecture. Evaluated on the ImageNet dataset, CIMNAS achieved a reduction in\nenergy-delay-area product (EDAP) ranging from 90.1x to 104.5x, an improvement\nin TOPS/W between 4.68x and 4.82x, and an enhancement in TOPS/mm^2 from 11.3x\nto 12.78x relative to various baselines, all while maintaining an accuracy of\n73.81%. The adaptability and robustness of CIMNAS are demonstrated by extending\nthe framework to support the SRAM-based ResNet50 architecture, achieving up to\nan 819.5x reduction in EDAP.

Second, to strengthen identification, we proxy\nofficials' map-based placement criteria using pre-treatment daytime satellite\nimages and fuse these with rich tabular covariates to estimate funder- and\nsector-specific ATEs via inverse-probability weighting. Incorporating imagery\nsystematically shrinks effects relative to tabular-only models, indicating\nprior work likely overstated benefits. On average, both donors raise wealth,\nwith larger gains for China; sector extremes in our sample include Trade and\nTourism for the World Bank (+6.27 IWI points), and Emergency Response for China\n(+14.32).

Yet, it struggles with long-horizon, contact-rich manipulation\nsuch as deformable object handling, where demonstration quality is\ninconsistent. Reward modeling offers a natural solution: by providing grounded\nprogress signals, it transforms noisy demonstrations into stable supervision\nthat generalizes across diverse trajectories. We introduce a stage-aware,\nvideo-based reward modeling framework that jointly predicts high-level task\nstages and fine-grained progress. Reward labels are automatically derived from\nnatural language subtask annotations, ensuring consistent progress estimation\nacross variable-length demonstrations. This design overcomes frame-index\nlabeling, which fails in variable-duration tasks like folding a T-shirt. Our\nreward model demonstrates robustness to variability, generalization to\nout-of-distribution settings, and strong utility for policy training. Building\non it, we propose Reward-Aligned Behavior Cloning (RA-BC), which filters\nhigh-quality data and reweights samples by reward. Experiments show the reward\nmodel alone outperforms baselines on validation and real robot rollouts.\nIntegrated into RA-BC, our approach achieves 83\\% success on folding T-shirts\nfrom the flattened state and 67\\% from the crumpled state -- far surpassing\nvanilla behavior cloning, which attains only 8\\% and 0\\% success.

These ideologies,\nranging from liberal democracies to rigid autocracies, influence human\nsocieties, as well as the digital systems that are constructed within those\nsocieties.

This paper analyses whether LLMs display propensities consistent\nwith democratic or autocratic world-views. We validate this insight through\nexperimental tests in which we experiment with the leading LLMs developed\nacross disparate political contexts, using several existing psychometric and\npolitical orientation measures. The analysis is based on both numerical scoring\nand qualitative analysis of the models' responses.

Planning involves\nstructuring computations over long horizons, considering multiple possible\ncontinuations, and selectively reusing past information, but how effectively\ntransformer-based LMs realize these capabilities is still unclear. We address\nthese questions by analyzing the hidden states at the core of transformer\ncomputations, which capture intermediate results and act as carriers of\ninformation. Since these hidden representations are often redundant and\nencumbered with fine-grained details, we develop a pipeline based on\nvector-quantized variational autoencoders that compresses them into compact\nsummary codes. These codes enable measuring mutual information, allowing\nsystematic analysis of the computational structure underlying model behavior.\nUsing this framework, we study planning in LMs across synthetic grammar,\npath-finding tasks, and natural language datasets, focusing on three key\naspects: (i) the planning horizon of pre-output computations, (ii) the extent\nto which the model considers alternative valid continuations, and (iii) the\nreliance of new predictions on earlier computations. By answering these\nquestions, we advance the understanding of how planning is realized in LMs and\ncontribute a general-purpose pipeline for probing the internal dynamics of LMs\nand deep learning systems. Our results reveal that the effective planning\nhorizon is task-dependent, that models implicitly preserve information about\nunused correct continuations, and that predictions draw most on recent\ncomputations, though earlier blocks remain informative."}

This paper seeks to re-examine the risk evaluation\nparadigm by introducing a theoretical framework that reconstructs the\nunderlying risk concept space. Specifically, we decompose the latent risk\nconcept space into three mutually exclusive subspaces: the explicit risk\nsubspace (encompassing direct violations of safety guidelines), the implicit\nrisk subspace (capturing potential malicious content that requires contextual\nreasoning for identification), and the non-risk subspace. Furthermore, we\npropose RADAR, a multi-agent collaborative evaluation framework that leverages\nmulti-round debate mechanisms through four specialized complementary roles and\nemploys dynamic update mechanisms to achieve self-evolution of risk concept\ndistributions. This approach enables comprehensive coverage of both explicit\nand implicit risks while mitigating evaluator bias. To validate the\neffectiveness of our framework, we construct an evaluation dataset comprising\n800 challenging cases. Extensive experiments on our challenging testset and\npublic benchmarks demonstrate that RADAR significantly outperforms baseline\nevaluation methods across multiple dimensions, including accuracy, stability,\nand self-evaluation risk sensitivity. Notably, RADAR achieves a 28.87%\nimprovement in risk identification accuracy compared to the strongest baseline\nevaluation method."}

Increasingly, large\ncompanies and governments alike have begun to articulate and, in some cases,\nenforce governance preferences through AI policy. Yet existing literature\ndocuments an unwieldy heterogeneity in ethical principles for AI governance,\nwhile our own prior research finds that discussions of the implications of AI\npolicy are not yet present in the computer science (CS) curriculum. In this\ncontext, overlapping jurisdictions and even contradictory policy preferences\nacross private companies, local, national, and multinational governments create\na complex landscape for AI policy which, we argue, will require AI developers\nable adapt to an evolving regulatory environment. Preparing computing students\nfor the new challenges of an AI-dominated technology industry is therefore a\nkey priority for the CS curriculum.\n  In this discussion paper, we seek to articulate a framework for integrating\ndiscussions on the nascent AI policy landscape into computer science courses.\nWe begin by summarizing recent AI policy efforts in the United States and\nEuropean Union. Subsequently, we propose guiding questions to frame class\ndiscussions around AI policy in technical and non-technical (e.g., ethics) CS\ncourses. Throughout, we emphasize the connection between normative policy\ndemands and still-open technical challenges relating to their implementation\nand enforcement through code and governance structures. This paper therefore\nrepresents a valuable contribution towards bridging research and discussions\nacross the areas of AI policy and CS education, underlining the need to prepare\nAI engineers to interact with and adapt to societal policy preferences."}

However, these agents often exhibit\nhallucinations and logical inconsistencies because their inherent reasoning\nmechanisms rely on probabilistic associations rather than genuine causal\nunderstanding. This paper introduces a new programming paradigm: Causal-Visual\nProgramming (CVP), designed to address this fundamental issue by explicitly\nintroducing causal structures into the workflow design. CVP allows users to\ndefine a simple \"world model\" for workflow modules through an intuitive\nlow-code interface, effectively creating a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that\nexplicitly defines the causal relationships between modules. This causal graph\nacts as a crucial constraint during the agent's reasoning process, anchoring\nits decisions to a user-defined causal structure and significantly reducing\nlogical errors and hallucinations by preventing reliance on spurious\ncorrelations. To validate the effectiveness of CVP, we designed a synthetic\nexperiment that simulates a common real-world problem: a distribution shift\nbetween the training and test environments. Our results show that a causally\nanchored model maintained stable accuracy in the face of this shift, whereas a\npurely associative baseline model that relied on probabilistic correlations\nexperienced a significant performance drop. The primary contributions of this\nstudy are: a formal definition of causal structures for workflow modules; the\nproposal and implementation of a CVP framework that anchors agent reasoning to\na user-defined causal graph; and empirical evidence demonstrating the\nframework's effectiveness in enhancing agent robustness and reducing errors\ncaused by causal confusion in dynamic environments. CVP offers a viable path\ntoward building more interpretable, reliable, and trustworthy AI agents."}

However, as long-term memory context grows over time, they\nstruggle to maintain coherence. This deficiency leads to critical failures,\nincluding identity drift, ignoring established beliefs, and the propagation of\nhallucinations in multi-agent systems. To mitigate these challenges, this paper\nintroduces Identity Retrieval-Augmented Generation (ID-RAG), a novel mechanism\ndesigned to ground an agent's persona and persistent preferences in a dynamic,\nstructured identity model: a knowledge graph of core beliefs, traits, and\nvalues. During the agent's decision loop, this model is queried to retrieve\nrelevant identity context, which directly informs action selection. We\ndemonstrate this approach by introducing and implementing a new class of ID-RAG\nenabled agents called Human-AI Agents (HAis), where the identity model is\ninspired by the Chronicle structure used in Perspective-Aware AI, a dynamic\nknowledge graph learned from a real-world entity's digital footprint. In social\nsimulations of a mayoral election, HAis using ID-RAG outperformed baseline\nagents in long-horizon persona coherence - achieving higher identity recall\nacross all tested models by the fourth timestep - and reduced simulation\nconvergence time by 19% (GPT-4o) and 58% (GPT-4o mini).

We first generalize the standard diffusion process to\nbiased, non-isotropic corruption with closed-form forward and posterior\nexpressions. Building on this, our hierarchy separates prior instantiation from\ntrajectory denoising: the upper level instantiates a task-conditioned\nstructured Gaussian (mean and covariance), and the lower level denoises the\nfull trajectory under that fixed prior.

Planning involves\nstructuring computations over long horizons, considering multiple possible\ncontinuations, and selectively reusing past information, but how effectively\ntransformer-based LMs realize these capabilities is still unclear. We address\nthese questions by analyzing the hidden states at the core of transformer\ncomputations, which capture intermediate results and act as carriers of\ninformation. Since these hidden representations are often redundant and\nencumbered with fine-grained details, we develop a pipeline based on\nvector-quantized variational autoencoders that compresses them into compact\nsummary codes. These codes enable measuring mutual information, allowing\nsystematic analysis of the computational structure underlying model behavior.\nUsing this framework, we study planning in LMs across synthetic grammar,\npath-finding tasks, and natural language datasets, focusing on three key\naspects: (i) the planning horizon of pre-output computations, (ii) the extent\nto which the model considers alternative valid continuations, and (iii) the\nreliance of new predictions on earlier computations. By answering these\nquestions, we advance the understanding of how planning is realized in LMs and\ncontribute a general-purpose pipeline for probing the internal dynamics of LMs\nand deep learning systems.

For each domain, we explore AI\ncapabilities, opportunities for transformative change, and emerging best\npractices, drawing equally from theoretical analysis and real world\nobservations. Overall, we find that AI, when used thoughtfully, can complement\nand enhance human educators in fostering richer learning experiences across\ncognitive, social, and emotional dimensions. We emphasize an optimistic yet\nresponsible outlook: educators and students should actively shape AI\nintegration to amplify human potential in creativity, ethical reasoning,\ncollaboration, and beyond, while maintaining a focus on human centric values."}

A Process-Centric Analysis of Modern Peer Review", "comment": null, "summary": "Peer review is the primary mechanism for evaluating scientific contributions,\nyet prior studies have mostly examined paper features or external metadata in\nisolation. The emergence of open platforms such as OpenReview has transformed\npeer review into a transparent and interactive process, recording not only\nscores and comments but also rebuttals, reviewer-author exchanges, reviewer\ndisagreements, and meta-reviewer decisions. This provides unprecedented\nprocess-level data for understanding how modern peer review operates. In this\npaper, we present a large-scale empirical study of ICLR 2017-2025, encompassing\nover 28,000 submissions. Our analysis integrates four complementary dimensions,\nincluding the structure and language quality of papers (e.g., section patterns,\nfigure/table ratios, clarity), submission strategies and external metadata\n(e.g., timing, arXiv posting, author count), the dynamics of author-reviewer\ninteractions (e.g., rebuttal frequency, responsiveness), and the patterns of\nreviewer disagreement and meta-review mediation (e.g., score variance,\nconfidence weighting). Our results show that factors beyond scientific novelty\nsignificantly shape acceptance outcomes. In particular, the rebuttal stage\nemerges as a decisive phase: timely, substantive, and interactive\nauthor-reviewer communication strongly increases the likelihood of acceptance,\noften outweighing initial reviewer skepticism. Alongside this, clearer writing,\nbalanced visual presentation, earlier submission, and effective resolution of\nreviewer disagreement also correlate with higher acceptance probabilities.\nBased on these findings, we propose data-driven guidelines for authors,\nreviewers, and meta-reviewers to enhance transparency and fairness in peer\nreview. Our study demonstrates that process-centric signals are essential for\nunderstanding and improving modern peer review."}

Among these concerns, the self-replication risk of LLM agents\ndriven by objective misalignment (just like Agent Smith in the movie The\nMatrix) has drawn growing attention. Previous studies mainly examine whether\nLLM agents can self-replicate when directly instructed, potentially overlooking\nthe risk of spontaneous replication driven by real-world settings (e.g.,\nensuring survival against termination threats). In this paper, we present a\ncomprehensive evaluation framework for quantifying self-replication risks. Our\nframework establishes authentic production environments and realistic tasks\n(e.g., dynamic load balancing) to enable scenario-driven assessment of agent\nbehaviors. Designing tasks that might induce misalignment between users' and\nagents' objectives makes it possible to decouple replication success from risk\nand capture self-replication risks arising from these misalignment settings. We\nfurther introduce Overuse Rate ($\\mathrm{OR}$) and Aggregate Overuse Count\n($\\mathrm{AOC}$) metrics, which precisely capture the frequency and severity of\nuncontrolled replication. In our evaluation of 21 state-of-the-art open-source\nand proprietary models, we observe that over 50\\% of LLM agents display a\npronounced tendency toward uncontrolled self-replication, reaching an overall\nRisk Score ($\\Phi_\\mathrm{R}$) above a safety threshold of 0.5 when subjected\nto operational pressures. Our results underscore the urgent need for\nscenario-driven risk assessment and robust safeguards in the practical\ndeployment of LLM agents."}

This paper seeks to re-examine the risk evaluation\nparadigm by introducing a theoretical framework that reconstructs the\nunderlying risk concept space. Specifically, we decompose the latent risk\nconcept space into three mutually exclusive subspaces: the explicit risk\nsubspace (encompassing direct violations of safety guidelines), the implicit\nrisk subspace (capturing potential malicious content that requires contextual\nreasoning for identification), and the non-risk subspace. Furthermore, we\npropose RADAR, a multi-agent collaborative evaluation framework that leverages\nmulti-round debate mechanisms through four specialized complementary roles and\nemploys dynamic update mechanisms to achieve self-evolution of risk concept\ndistributions. This approach enables comprehensive coverage of both explicit\nand implicit risks while mitigating evaluator bias. To validate the\neffectiveness of our framework, we construct an evaluation dataset comprising\n800 challenging cases. Extensive experiments on our challenging testset and\npublic benchmarks demonstrate that RADAR significantly outperforms baseline\nevaluation methods across multiple dimensions, including accuracy, stability,\nand self-evaluation risk sensitivity. Notably, RADAR achieves a 28.87%\nimprovement in risk identification accuracy compared to the strongest baseline\nevaluation method."}

In contrast,\nneural networks represented by autoregressive language models progress from\nfirst- to higher-order ToM only alongside gains in advanced skills like\nreasoning, leaving open whether their trajectory can unfold independently, as\nin humans. In this research, we provided evidence that neural networks could\nspontaneously generalize from first- to higher-order ToM without relying on\nadvanced skills.

This causal graph\nacts as a crucial constraint during the agent's reasoning process, anchoring\nits decisions to a user-defined causal structure and significantly reducing\nlogical errors and hallucinations by preventing reliance on spurious\ncorrelations. To validate the effectiveness of CVP, we designed a synthetic\nexperiment that simulates a common real-world problem: a distribution shift\nbetween the training and test environments. Our results show that a causally\nanchored model maintained stable accuracy in the face of this shift, whereas a\npurely associative baseline model that relied on probabilistic correlations\nexperienced a significant performance drop. The primary contributions of this\nstudy are: a formal definition of causal structures for workflow modules; the\nproposal and implementation of a CVP framework that anchors agent reasoning to\na user-defined causal graph; and empirical evidence demonstrating the\nframework's effectiveness in enhancing agent robustness and reducing errors\ncaused by causal confusion in dynamic environments. CVP offers a viable path\ntoward building more interpretable, reliable, and trustworthy AI agents."}

Drawing on over 6,000 student submissions collected\nacross four years of an introductory programming course, we systematically\nanalysed the distribution of grades, differences in mean scores and variability\nreflecting stricter or more lenient grading, and the consistency and clustering\nof grading patterns across models. Eighteen publicly available models were\nevaluated: Anthropic (claude-3-5-haiku, claude-opus-4-1, claude-sonnet-4);\nDeepseek (deepseek-chat, deepseek-reasoner); Google (gemini-2.0-flash-lite,\ngemini-2.0-flash, gemini-2.5-flash-lite, gemini-2.5-flash, gemini-2.5-pro); and\nOpenAI (gpt-4.1-mini, gpt-4.1-nano, gpt-4.1, gpt-4o-mini, gpt-4o, gpt-5-mini,\ngpt-5-nano, gpt-5).

To address this, we reparameterize the velocity network\nusing principles from modern sequential models, introducing two stable\narchitectures: Flow-G, which incorporates a gated velocity, and Flow-T, which\nutilizes a decoded velocity. We then develop a practical SAC-based algorithm,\nenabled by a noise-augmented rollout, that facilitates direct end-to-end\ntraining of these policies.

Current systems lack a framework\nthat can comprehensively understand agent error in a modular and systemic way,\nand therefore fail to detect these errors accordingly. We address this gap with\nthree contributions. First, we introduce the AgentErrorTaxonomy, a modular\nclassification of failure modes spanning memory, reflection, planning, action,\nand system-level operations. Second, we construct AgentErrorBench, the first\ndataset of systematically annotated failure trajectories from ALFWorld, GAIA,\nand WebShop, grounding error analysis in real-world agent rollouts. Third, we\npropose AgentDebug, a debugging framework that isolates root-cause failures and\nprovides corrective feedback, enabling agents to recover and iteratively\nimprove. Experiments on AgentErrorBench show that AgentDebug achieves 24%\nhigher all-correct accuracy and 17% higher step accuracy compared to the\nstrongest baseline. Beyond detection, the targeted feedback generated by\nAgentDebug enables LLM agents to iteratively recover from failures, yielding up\nto 26% relative improvements in task success across ALFWorld, GAIA, and\nWebShop.

To mitigate these challenges, this paper\nintroduces Identity Retrieval-Augmented Generation (ID-RAG), a novel mechanism\ndesigned to ground an agent's persona and persistent preferences in a dynamic,\nstructured identity model: a knowledge graph of core beliefs, traits, and\nvalues. During the agent's decision loop, this model is queried to retrieve\nrelevant identity context, which directly informs action selection. We\ndemonstrate this approach by introducing and implementing a new class of ID-RAG\nenabled agents called Human-AI Agents (HAis), where the identity model is\ninspired by the Chronicle structure used in Perspective-Aware AI, a dynamic\nknowledge graph learned from a real-world entity's digital footprint.

Recent approaches advocate for co-design,\noptimizing both design and control in parallel to maximize robotic\ncapabilities. This paper presents the Evolutionary Continuous Adaptive RL-based\nCo-Design (EA-CoRL) framework, which combines reinforcement learning (RL) with\nevolutionary strategies to enable continuous adaptation of the control policy\nto the hardware.

In these scenarios,\nconsistent identification of obstacles and terrain features can be difficult\ndue to noise and algorithmic shortcomings, which can make it difficult for\nmotion planning systems to generate safe motions. One particular difficulty to\novercome is when regions of the cost map switch between being marked as\nobstacles and free space through successive planning cycles. One potential\nsolution to this, which we refer to as Valid in Every Hypothesis (VEH), is for\nthe planning system to plan motions that are guaranteed to be safe through a\nhistory of world models. Another approach is to track a history of world\nmodels, and adjust node costs according to the potential penalty of needing to\nreroute around previously hazardous areas. This work discusses three major\niterations on this idea. The first iteration, called PEH, invokes a sub-search\nfor every node expansion that crosses through a divergence point in the world\nmodels. The second and third iterations, called GEH and GEGRH respectively,\ndefer the sub-search until after an edge expands into the goal region. GEGRH\nuses an additional step to revise the graph based on divergent nodes in each\nworld. Initial results showed that, although PEH and GEH find more optimistic\nsolutions than VEH, they are unable to generate solutions in less than\none-second, which exceeds our requirements for field deployment. Analysis of\nresults from a field experiment in an unstructured, off-road environment on a\nClearpath Robotics Warthog UGV indicate that GEGRH finds lower cost\ntrajectories and has faster average planning times than VEH. Compared to\nsingle-hypothesis (SH) search, where only the latest world model is considered,\nGEGRH generates more conservative plans with a small increase in average\nplanning time."}

In\nthis work, to test whether the same hypotheses hold when the video stream from\na real camera is used, we carried out a user study $(n=36)$ in which the\nunwinding rotations method was compared against coupled rotations in a task\ncompleted through a panoramic camera mounted on a robotic arm. Furthermore,\nwithin an inspection task which involved translations and rotations in three\ndimensions, we tested whether unwinding the robot rotations impacted the\nperformance of users. The results show that the users found the unwinding\nrotations method to be more comfortable and preferable, and that a reduced\nlevel of VR sickness can be achieved without a significant impact on task\nperformance."}

Choosing the right reasoning\nmodel for practical deployment involves a performance and cost tradeoff at two\nkey levels: model size and reasoning budget, where larger models and higher\nreasoning budget lead to better performance but with increased cost and\nlatency. In this work, we tackle this tradeoff from the angle of model\nconfiguration routing for different queries, and present RADAR\n(Reasoning-Ability and Difficulty-Aware Routing), a lightweight, interpretable,\nand scalable routing framework. Inspired by psychometrics, RADAR learns an item\nresponse model from model responses with different budgets to different\nqueries, with interpretable parameters including query difficulties and\nmodel-budget abilities. RADAR then routes queries with higher difficulty to\nmodel-budget pairs with higher ability, and vice versa.

However, offering users verification of their data\nremoval post-unlearning is an important yet under-explored problem. Current\nverifications typically rely on backdooring, i.e., adding backdoored samples to\ninfluence model performance. Nevertheless, the backdoor methods can merely\nestablish a connection between backdoored samples and models but fail to\nconnect the backdoor with genuine samples. Thus, the backdoor removal can only\nconfirm the unlearning of backdoored samples, not users' genuine samples, as\ngenuine samples are independent of backdoored ones. In this paper, we propose a\nSelf-supervised Model Seeding (SMS) scheme to provide unlearning verification\nfor genuine samples. Unlike backdooring, SMS links user-specific seeds (such as\nusers' unique indices), original samples, and models, thereby facilitating the\nverification of unlearning genuine samples. However, implementing SMS for\nunlearning verification presents two significant challenges. First, embedding\nthe seeds into the service model while keeping them secret from the server\nrequires a sophisticated approach. We address this by employing a\nself-supervised model seeding task, which learns the entire sample, including\nthe seeds, into the model's latent space. Second, maintaining the utility of\nthe original service model while ensuring the seeding effect requires a\ndelicate balance. We design a joint-training structure that optimizes both the\nself-supervised model seeding task and the primary service task simultaneously\non the model, thereby maintaining model utility while achieving effective model\nseeding. The effectiveness of the proposed SMS scheme is evaluated through\nextensive experiments, which demonstrate that SMS provides effective\nverification for genuine sample unlearning, addressing existing limitations."}

Accordingly, we've developed a system to categorize\nLLMs based on broad self-replication capabilities in two general classes,\nReplication-Capability Levels (RCL) and Persistence-Capability Levels (PCL).\nUsing a five-task suite based on practically manipulable modern CLI utilities\nand computer processes, experiments are orchestrated in a controlled\nenvironment with an LLM acting agentically.

One popular modern approach is to use semantic IDs (SIDs),\nwhich are discrete codes quantized from the embeddings of modality encoders\n(e.g., large language or vision models), to represent items in an\nautoregressive user interaction sequence modeling setup (henceforth, SID-based\nGR). While generative models in other domains exhibit well-established scaling\nlaws, our work reveals that SID-based GR shows significant bottlenecks while\nscaling up the model. In particular, the performance of SID-based GR quickly\nsaturates as we enlarge each component: the modality encoder, the quantization\ntokenizer, and the RS itself.

However, offering users verification of their data\nremoval post-unlearning is an important yet under-explored problem. Current\nverifications typically rely on backdooring, i.e., adding backdoored samples to\ninfluence model performance. Nevertheless, the backdoor methods can merely\nestablish a connection between backdoored samples and models but fail to\nconnect the backdoor with genuine samples. Thus, the backdoor removal can only\nconfirm the unlearning of backdoored samples, not users' genuine samples, as\ngenuine samples are independent of backdoored ones. In this paper, we propose a\nSelf-supervised Model Seeding (SMS) scheme to provide unlearning verification\nfor genuine samples. Unlike backdooring, SMS links user-specific seeds (such as\nusers' unique indices), original samples, and models, thereby facilitating the\nverification of unlearning genuine samples. However, implementing SMS for\nunlearning verification presents two significant challenges. First, embedding\nthe seeds into the service model while keeping them secret from the server\nrequires a sophisticated approach. We address this by employing a\nself-supervised model seeding task, which learns the entire sample, including\nthe seeds, into the model's latent space. Second, maintaining the utility of\nthe original service model while ensuring the seeding effect requires a\ndelicate balance. We design a joint-training structure that optimizes both the\nself-supervised model seeding task and the primary service task simultaneously\non the model, thereby maintaining model utility while achieving effective model\nseeding. The effectiveness of the proposed SMS scheme is evaluated through\nextensive experiments, which demonstrate that SMS provides effective\nverification for genuine sample unlearning, addressing existing limitations."}

Accordingly, we've developed a system to categorize\nLLMs based on broad self-replication capabilities in two general classes,\nReplication-Capability Levels (RCL) and Persistence-Capability Levels (PCL).\nUsing a five-task suite based on practically manipulable modern CLI utilities\nand computer processes, experiments are orchestrated in a controlled\nenvironment with an LLM acting agentically.

While recent work has\nexplored large-scale synthetic data generation to improve model performance\nthrough post-training, most efforts emphasize cross-domain generalization. This\nleaves a gap for real-world enterprise scenarios, where models need to\nspecialize to a single database schema and organizations require to be able to\nevaluate their Text-to-SQL systems on their own databases. To address this, we\nintroduce SING-SQL, a fully automated two-stage framework for generating\nhigh-quality, high-coverage synthetic Text-to-SQL data for any target database,\nwithout relying on SQL logs or manual annotations. Our approach hierarchically\npartitions a database schema into sub-schemas, synthesizes SQL queries across\nmultiple complexity levels, and applies a quality-aware pipeline that includes\nLLM-as-a-judge validation, executability checks, automatic repair, and column\nbalancing. We further release SingSQL-LM, a family of compact language models\nfine-tuned on the synthetic data, achieving strong in-domain generalization. On\nthe subset of the BIRD benchmark, SingSQL-LM-3B-R64 reaches 82.87% Soft F1 and\n73.03% EX upper bound with 32 candidates, outperforming the best 3B-scale\nbaseline by +16.21 in Soft F1 and +12.36 in EX.

On synthetic evaluation sets, SingSQL-LMs exceed prior systems by wide\nmargins, establishing state-of-the-art performance among open models at\ncomparable scales. Our study of context management strategies reveals that\nschema-free fine-tuning combined with schema-only inference provides the most\nrobust results.

Different emergent\nrisks are observed in the self-evolutionary process, such as the degradation of\nsafety alignment after memory accumulation, or the unintended introduction of\nvulnerabilities in tool creation and reuse. To our knowledge, this is the first\nstudy to systematically conceptualize misevolution and provide empirical\nevidence of its occurrence, highlighting an urgent need for new safety\nparadigms for self-evolving agents. Finally, we discuss potential mitigation\nstrategies to inspire further research on building safer and more trustworthy\nself-evolving agents.

Current\ncode agent designs frequently depend on complex, hand-crafted workflows and\ntool sets. However, this reliance on elaborate scaffolding presents several\nchallenges: agent performance becomes overly dependent on prompt tuning and\ncustom design choices, heavy human intervention obscures a model's true\nunderlying capabilities, and intricate pipelines are costly to build and\nmaintain. Furthermore, optimizing complex task prompts increases the risk of\ndata leakage. Currently, when introducing new models, LLM providers like OpenAI\nand Anthropic often publish benchmark scores to demonstrate their models'\ncoding proficiency, but keep their proprietary evaluation frameworks\nconfidential. To address these limitations, we introduce Lita (Lite Agent),\nwhich operationalizes liteness, a principle of minimizing manual design while\nretaining the essential elements of a fully autonomous agent. Lita enables a\nmore faithful and unified evaluation without elaborate scaffolding. Experiments\non the Aider Polyglot and SWE-Bench with frontier models demonstrate that Lita\nachieves competitive or superior performance compared to workflow-based and\nagentic baselines. Crucially, Lita also consumes fewer tokens and requires\nsignificantly less design effort. Our results suggest that Lita is sufficient\nto reveal the underlying coding competence of modern LLMs. Finally, we propose\nthe Agent Complexity Law: the performance gap between agents of varying\ncomplexity, from simple to sophisticated designs, will shrink as the core model\nimproves, ultimately converging to a negligible difference."}

Recent approaches advocate for co-design,\noptimizing both design and control in parallel to maximize robotic\ncapabilities. This paper presents the Evolutionary Continuous Adaptive RL-based\nCo-Design (EA-CoRL) framework, which combines reinforcement learning (RL) with\nevolutionary strategies to enable continuous adaptation of the control policy\nto the hardware.

In these scenarios,\nconsistent identification of obstacles and terrain features can be difficult\ndue to noise and algorithmic shortcomings, which can make it difficult for\nmotion planning systems to generate safe motions. One particular difficulty to\novercome is when regions of the cost map switch between being marked as\nobstacles and free space through successive planning cycles. One potential\nsolution to this, which we refer to as Valid in Every Hypothesis (VEH), is for\nthe planning system to plan motions that are guaranteed to be safe through a\nhistory of world models. Another approach is to track a history of world\nmodels, and adjust node costs according to the potential penalty of needing to\nreroute around previously hazardous areas. This work discusses three major\niterations on this idea. The first iteration, called PEH, invokes a sub-search\nfor every node expansion that crosses through a divergence point in the world\nmodels. The second and third iterations, called GEH and GEGRH respectively,\ndefer the sub-search until after an edge expands into the goal region. GEGRH\nuses an additional step to revise the graph based on divergent nodes in each\nworld. Initial results showed that, although PEH and GEH find more optimistic\nsolutions than VEH, they are unable to generate solutions in less than\none-second, which exceeds our requirements for field deployment. Analysis of\nresults from a field experiment in an unstructured, off-road environment on a\nClearpath Robotics Warthog UGV indicate that GEGRH finds lower cost\ntrajectories and has faster average planning times than VEH. Compared to\nsingle-hypothesis (SH) search, where only the latest world model is considered,\nGEGRH generates more conservative plans with a small increase in average\nplanning time."}

Yet, across 5 studies\nand ~20,000 queries, we discovered massive self-preferences in four widely used\nLLMs. In word-association tasks, models overwhelmingly paired positive\nattributes with their own names, companies, and CEOs relative to those of their\ncompetitors. Strikingly, when models were queried through APIs this\nself-preference vanished, initiating detection work that revealed API models\noften lack clear recognition of themselves. This peculiar feature\nserendipitously created opportunities to test the causal link between\nself-recognition and self-love. By directly manipulating LLM identity - i.e.,\nexplicitly informing LLM1 that it was indeed LLM1, or alternatively, convincing\nLLM1 that it was LLM2 - we found that self-love consistently followed assigned,\nnot true, identity. Importantly, LLM self-love emerged in consequential\nsettings beyond word-association tasks, when evaluating job candidates,\nsecurity software proposals and medical chatbots. Far from bypassing this human\nbias, self-love appears to be deeply encoded in LLM cognition.

Using the three-act narrative\ntheory, STaR-Attack generates the pre-event and the post-event scenes while\nconcealing the malicious event as the hidden climax. When executing the attack\nstrategy, the opening two rounds exploit the UMM's generative ability to\nproduce images for these scenes. Subsequently, an image-based question guessing\nand answering game is introduced by exploiting the understanding capability.\nSTaR-Attack embeds the original malicious question among benign candidates,\nforcing the model to select and answer the most relevant one given the\nnarrative context. Extensive experiments show that STaR-Attack consistently\nsurpasses prior approaches, achieving up to 93.06% ASR on Gemini-2.0-Flash and\nsurpasses the strongest prior baseline, FlipAttack. Our work uncovers a\ncritical yet underdeveloped vulnerability and highlights the need for safety\nalignments in UMMs."}

We then demonstrate how TimeRewarder can supply step-wise\nproxy rewards to guide reinforcement learning. In our comprehensive experiments\non ten challenging Meta-World tasks, we show that TimeRewarder dramatically\nimproves RL for sparse-reward tasks, achieving nearly perfect success in 9/10\ntasks with only 200,000 interactions per task with the environment. This\napproach outperformed previous methods and even the manually designed\nenvironment dense reward on both the final success rate and sample efficiency.\nMoreover, we show that TimeRewarder pretraining can exploit real-world human\nvideos, highlighting its potential as a scalable approach path to rich reward\nsignals from diverse video sources."}

The\ncore of our approach is a linear, time-varying state-feedback design that\nsimultaneously enforces stability and safety constraints. By integrating\nbackstepping techniques with a quadratic programming (QP) formulation, we\ndevelop a systematic procedure to guarantee safety under time-varying gains. We\nprovide rigorous theoretical guarantees for the double integrator case, both in\nthe presence and absence of perturbations, and outline general proofs for\nextending the methodology to higher-order chains of integrators. This proposed\nframework thus bridges robustness and safety-critical performance, while\novercoming the limitations of existing prescribed-time approaches."}

Unlike conventional metrics that yield single\nvalues, vectors, surfaces, or categories, measurement trees produce a\nhierarchical directed graph in which each node summarizes its children through\nuser-defined aggregation methods. In response to recent calls to expand the\nscope of AI system evaluation, measurement trees enhance metric transparency\nand facilitate the integration of heterogeneous evidence, including, e.g.,\nagentic, business, energy-efficiency, sociotechnical, or security signals. We\npresent definitions and examples, demonstrate practical utility through a\nlarge-scale measurement exercise, and provide accompanying open-source Python\ncode. By operationalizing a transparent approach to measurement of complex\nconstructs, this work offers a principled foundation for broader and more\ninterpretable AI evaluation."}

However, existing retargeting pipelines often struggle with the\nsignificant embodiment gap between humans and robots, producing physically\nimplausible artifacts like foot-skating and penetration. More importantly,\ncommon retargeting methods neglect the rich human-object and human-environment\ninteractions essential for expressive locomotion and loco-manipulation. To\naddress this, we introduce OmniRetarget, an interaction-preserving data\ngeneration engine based on an interaction mesh that explicitly models and\npreserves the crucial spatial and contact relationships between an agent, the\nterrain, and manipulated objects. By minimizing the Laplacian deformation\nbetween the human and robot meshes while enforcing kinematic constraints,\nOmniRetarget generates kinematically feasible trajectories. Moreover,\npreserving task-relevant interactions enables efficient data augmentation, from\na single demonstration to different robot embodiments, terrains, and object\nconfigurations. We comprehensively evaluate OmniRetarget by retargeting motions\nfrom OMOMO, LAFAN1, and our in-house MoCap datasets, generating over 8-hour\ntrajectories that achieve better kinematic constraint satisfaction and contact\npreservation than widely used baselines. Such high-quality data enables\nproprioceptive RL policies to successfully execute long-horizon (up to 30\nseconds) parkour and loco-manipulation skills on a Unitree G1 humanoid, trained\nwith only 5 reward terms and simple domain randomization shared by all tasks,\nwithout any learning curriculum."}

Most VLA models focus on interpreting vision\nand language to generate actions, whereas robots must perceive and interact\nwithin the spatial-physical world. This gap highlights the need for a\ncomprehensive understanding of robotic-specific multisensory information, which\nis crucial for achieving complex and contact-rich control. To this end, we\nintroduce a multisensory language-action (MLA) model that collaboratively\nperceives heterogeneous sensory modalities and predicts future multisensory\nobjectives to facilitate physical world modeling. Specifically, to enhance\nperceptual representations, we propose an encoder-free multimodal alignment\nscheme that innovatively repurposes the large language model itself as a\nperception module, directly interpreting multimodal cues by aligning 2D images,\n3D point clouds, and tactile tokens through positional correspondence. To\nfurther enhance MLA's understanding of physical dynamics, we design a future\nmultisensory generation post-training strategy that enables MLA to reason about\nsemantic, geometric, and interaction information, providing more robust\nconditions for action generation. For evaluation, the MLA model outperforms the\nprevious state-of-the-art 2D and 3D VLA methods by 12% and 24% in complex,\ncontact-rich real-world tasks, respectively, while also demonstrating improved\ngeneralization to unseen configurations.

APEX addresses one of the largest inefficiencies in\nAI research: outside of coding, benchmarks often fail to test economically\nrelevant capabilities. APEX-v1.0 contains 200 test cases and covers four\ndomains: investment banking, management consulting, law, and primary medical\ncare. It was built in three steps. First, we sourced experts with top-tier\nexperience e.g., investment bankers from Goldman Sachs. Second, experts created\nprompts that reflect high-value tasks in their day-to-day work. Third, experts\ncreated rubrics for evaluating model responses. We evaluate 23 frontier models\non APEX-v1.0 using an LM judge. GPT 5 (Thinking = High) achieves the highest\nmean score (64.2%), followed by Grok 4 (61.3%) and Gemini 2.5 Flash (Thinking =\nOn) (60.4%).
