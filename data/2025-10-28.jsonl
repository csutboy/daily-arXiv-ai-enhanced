Critically, this ability is shaped by the degree to\nwhich society invests in infrastructure, a fundamentally political question in\nlarge public systems. There, infrastructure providers are distinguished from\nusers through political processes, such as elections, and there is considerable\nheterogeneity among users. Previous political economic models have not taken\ninto account (i) dynamic infrastructures, (ii) dynamic user preferences, and\n(iii) alternatives to rational actor theory. Meanwhile, engineering often\nneglects politics. We address these gaps with a general dynamic model of shared\ninfrastructure systems that incorporates theories from political economy,\nsocial-ecological systems, and political psychology. We use the model to\ndevelop propositions on how multiple characteristics of the political process\nimpact the robustness of shared infrastructure systems to capacity shocks and\nunequal opportunity for private infrastructure investment. Under user fees,\ninequality decreases robustness, but taxing private infrastructure use can\nincrease robustness if non-elites have equal political influence. Election\ncycle periods have a nonlinear effect where increasing them increases\nrobustness up to a point but decreases robustness beyond that point. Further,\nthere is a negative relationship between the ideological sensitivity of\ncandidates and robustness. Overall, the biases of voters and candidates\n(whether they favor tax increases or decreases) mediate these\npolitical-economic effects on robustness because biases may or may not match\nthe reality of system needs (whether system recovery requires tax increases)."}

Currently, mainstream image-based\npest counting methods primarily rely on image processing combined with machine\nlearning or deep learning for pest counting.

To\naddress this issue, this paper proposed a robotic stirring method with\ntrajectory optimization and adaptive speed control for accurate pest counting\nin water traps. First, we developed an automated stirring system for pest\ncounting in yellow water traps based on a robotic arm. Stirring alters the\ndistribution of pests in the yellow water trap, making some of the occluded\nindividuals visible for detection and counting. Then, we investigated the\nimpact of different stirring trajectories on pest counting performance and\nselected the optimal trajectory for pest counting.

We present a novel\nforce-displacement profiling method that characterizes occluder deployment\ndynamics and identifies key procedural steps without relying on ionizing\nradiation. The force profiles reveal low-magnitude interaction forces,\nsuggesting minimal mechanical stress on the surrounding anatomy. This approach\nshows promise in providing clinicians with enhanced intraoperative feedback,\nimproving deployment outcome. Future work will focus on automating deployment\nsteps classification and validating the sensing strategy in dynamic, realistic\nenvironments."}

I introduce the Tukey model, which captures\ncomplementarities with a single interaction parameter, along with two\nextensions that allow richer complementarity patterns. First, I establish an\nidentification trade-off between the flexibility of the interaction function\nand the density of the matching network: the Tukey model is identified under\nmild conditions, whereas the more flexible extensions require dense networks\nthat are rarely observed in applications. Second, I propose a cycle-based\nestimator for the Tukey interaction parameter and show that it is consistent\nand asymptotically normal even when the network is sparse. Third, I use its\nasymptotic distribution to construct a formal test of no complementarities.\nFinally, an empirical illustration shows that the Tukey model recovers\neconomically meaningful complementarities."}

Their studies led to the potential deployment opportunities of\nStewart-Gough Platforms in many critical applications such as the medical\nfield, engineering machines, space research, electronic chip manufacturing,\nautomobile manufacturing, etc. Some of these applications need micro and\nnano-level movement control in 3D space for the motions to be precise,\ncomplicated, and repeatable; a Stewart-Gough platform fulfills these challenges\nsmartly. For this, the platform must be more accurate than the specified\napplication accuracy level and thus proper calibration for a parallel robot is\ncrucial. Forward kinematics-based calibration for these hexapod machines\nbecomes unnecessarily complex and inverse kinematics complete this task with\nmuch ease. To experiment with different calibration techniques, various\ncalibration approaches were implemented by using external instruments,\nconstraining one or more motions of the system, and using extra sensors for\nauto or self-calibration. This survey paid attention to those key\nmethodologies, their outcome, and important details related to inverse\nkinematic-based parallel robot calibrations. It was observed during this study\nthat the researchers focused on improving the accuracy of the platform position\nand orientation considering the errors contributed by one source or multiple\nsources. The error sources considered are mainly kinematic and structural, in\nsome cases, environmental factors also are reviewed, however, those\ncalibrations are done under no-load conditions. This study aims to review the\npresent state of the art in this field and highlight the processes and errors\nconsidered for the calibration of Stewart-Gough platforms."}

We introduce\ncomputational explanations, mappings from observations to intervention ready\ncausal accounts. We instantiate these explanations with Energy Structured\nCausal Models (ESCMs), in which mechanisms are expressed as constraints (energy\nfunctions or vector fields) rather than explicit input output maps, and\ninterventions act by local surgery on those constraints. This shift makes\ninternal structure manipulable at the level where explanations live: which\nrelations must hold, which can change, and what follows when they do.

We propose a verification-informed NN framework that\nincorporates worst-case constraint violations directly into training, producing\nmodels that are both accurate and provably safer. Through post-hoc\nverification, we achieve substantial reductions in worst-case violations and,\nfor the first time, verify all operational constraints of large-scale AC-OPF\nproxies. Practical feasibility is further enhanced via restoration and\nwarm-start strategies for infeasible operating points. Experiments on systems\nranging from 57 to 793 buses demonstrate scalability, speed, and reliability,\nbridging the gap between ML acceleration and safe, real-time deployment of\nAC-OPF solutions - and paving the way toward data-driven optimal control."}

To automate the modeling process, existing works have\nleveraged large language models (LLMs), prompting them to break down tasks into\nsteps for generating variables, constraints, and objectives. However, due to\nthe highly complex mathematical structures inherent in OR problems, standard\nfixed-step decomposition often fails to achieve high performance. To address\nthis challenge, we introduce OptiTree, a novel tree search approach designed to\nenhance modeling capabilities for complex problems through adaptive problem\ndecomposition into simpler subproblems. Specifically, we develop a modeling\ntree that organizes a wide range of OR problems based on their hierarchical\nproblem taxonomy and complexity, with each node representing a problem category\nand containing relevant high-level modeling thoughts. Given a problem to model,\nwe recurrently search the tree to identify a series of simpler subproblems and\nsynthesize the global modeling thoughts by adaptively integrating the\nhierarchical thoughts.

However, traditional static knowledge graph (KG)\nconstruction often overlooks the dynamic and time-sensitive nature of\nreal-world data, limiting adaptability to continuous changes. Moreover, recent\nzero- or few-shot approaches that avoid domain-specific fine-tuning or reliance\non prebuilt ontologies often suffer from instability across multiple runs, as\nwell as incomplete coverage of key facts. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce ATOM (AdapTive and OptiMized), a few-shot and scalable approach that\nbuilds and continuously updates Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) from\nunstructured texts.

For treatment generation, CLIN-LLM employs Biomedical\nSentence-BERT to retrieve top-k relevant dialogues from the 260,000-sample\nMedDialog corpus. The retrieved evidence and patient context are fed into a\nfine-tuned FLAN-T5 model for personalized treatment generation, followed by\npost-processing with RxNorm for antibiotic stewardship and drug-drug\ninteraction (DDI) screening.

Conventional iterative approaches linearize a\nhighly non-convex optimization objective, requiring repeated solving of normal\nequations, which often converge to local minima and thus produce suboptimal\nestimates. We propose a scalable, outlier-robust distributed planar PGO\nframework using Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). We cast distributed\nPGO as a partially observable Markov game defined on local pose-graphs, where\neach action refines a single edge's pose estimate. A graph partitioner\ndecomposes the global pose graph, and each robot runs a recurrent\nedge-conditioned Graph Neural Network (GNN) encoder with adaptive edge-gating\nto denoise noisy edges. Robots sequentially refine poses through a hybrid\npolicy that utilizes prior action memory and graph embeddings. After local\ngraph correction, a consensus scheme reconciles inter-robot disagreements to\nproduce a globally consistent estimate.

Whether treating sequences as a specialized language,\nrisking the loss of functional motif information, or as a separate modality,\nintroducing formidable alignment challenges, current strategies fundamentally\nlimit their reasoning capacity. We challenge this sequence-centric paradigm by\npositing that a more effective strategy is to provide Sci-LLMs with high-level\nstructured context derived from established bioinformatics tools, thereby\nbypassing the need to interpret low-level noisy sequence data directly. Through\na systematic comparison of leading Sci-LLMs on biological reasoning tasks, we\ntested three input modes: sequence-only, context-only, and a combination of\nboth. Our findings are striking: the context-only approach consistently and\nsubstantially outperforms all other modes.

This integration enables the robot\nto generate navigation decisions that are both socially compliant and\nphysically safe, under well-defined constraints such as personal space,\ncollision avoidance, and timing.

To capture complex\ninter-variable and dynamic temporal dependencies in bidding data, we propose\ntwo attention mechanisms separately treating embeddings of different variables\nand embeddings at different times as attention tokens for representation\nlearning. On top of the learned variable and temporal representations, a\nvariable-aware fusion module is used to perform adaptive bidding outcome\nprediction. To model the unique bidding data distribution, we devise a\nzero-inflated projection module to incorporate the estimated non-zero\nprobability into its value prediction, which makes up a joint optimization\nobjective containing classification and regression.

Although recent 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) based SLAM\nframeworks achieve high-fidelity mapping under clean conditions, they remain\nvulnerable to compounded degradations that degrade mapping and tracking\nperformance. A key observation underlying our work is that the original 3DGS\nrendering pipeline inherently behaves as an implicit low-pass filter,\nattenuating high-frequency noise but also risking over-smoothing. Building on\nthis insight, we propose RoGER-SLAM, a robust 3DGS SLAM system tailored for\nnoise and low-light resilience. The framework integrates three innovations: a\nStructure-Preserving Robust Fusion (SP-RoFusion) mechanism that couples\nrendered appearance, depth, and edge cues; an adaptive tracking objective with\nresidual balancing regularization; and a Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining\n(CLIP)-based enhancement module, selectively activated under compounded\ndegradations to restore semantic and structural fidelity.

Specifically, the study exploits the ability of Random-Set\nNeural Networks (RS-NNs) to explicitly quantify prediction uncertainty. Unlike\ntraditional CNNs or Bayesian methods, RS-NNs predict belief functions over sets\nof classes, allowing the system to identify and signal uncertainty clearly in\nnovel or ambiguous scenarios. The system is tested in a real-world autonomous\nracing vehicle software stack, with the RS-NN classifying the layout of the\nroad ahead and providing the associated uncertainty of the prediction.\nPerformance of the RS-NN under a range of road conditions is compared against\ntraditional CNN and Bayesian neural networks, with the RS-NN achieving\nsignificantly higher accuracy and superior uncertainty calibration. This\nintegration of RS-NNs into Robot Operating System (ROS)-based vehicle control\npipeline demonstrates that predictive uncertainty can dynamically modulate\nvehicle speed, maintaining high-speed performance under confident predictions\nwhile proactively improving safety through speed reductions in uncertain\nscenarios.

Conventional iterative approaches linearize a\nhighly non-convex optimization objective, requiring repeated solving of normal\nequations, which often converge to local minima and thus produce suboptimal\nestimates. We propose a scalable, outlier-robust distributed planar PGO\nframework using Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). We cast distributed\nPGO as a partially observable Markov game defined on local pose-graphs, where\neach action refines a single edge's pose estimate. A graph partitioner\ndecomposes the global pose graph, and each robot runs a recurrent\nedge-conditioned Graph Neural Network (GNN) encoder with adaptive edge-gating\nto denoise noisy edges. Robots sequentially refine poses through a hybrid\npolicy that utilizes prior action memory and graph embeddings. After local\ngraph correction, a consensus scheme reconciles inter-robot disagreements to\nproduce a globally consistent estimate. Our extensive evaluations on a\ncomprehensive suite of synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our\nlearned MARL-based actors reduce the global objective by an average of 37.5%\nmore than the state-of-the-art distributed PGO framework, while enhancing\ninference efficiency by at least 6X.

PIP-LLMs first decomposes the command by translating the\ncommand into a team-level PDDL problem and solves it to obtain a team-level\nplan, abstracting away robot assignment. Each team-level action represents a\nsubtask to be finished by the team. Next, this plan is translated into a\ndependency graph representing the subtasks' dependency structure. Such a\ndependency graph is then used to guide the robot-level planning, in which each\nsubtask node will be formulated as an IP-based task allocation problem,\nexplicitly optimizing travel costs and workload while respecting robot\ncapabilities and user-defined constraints. This separation of planning from\nassignment allows PIP-LLM to avoid the pitfalls of syntax-based decomposition\nand scale to larger teams. Experiments across diverse tasks show that PIP-LLM\nimproves plan success rate, reduces maximum and average travel costs, and\nachieves better load balancing compared to state-of-the-art baselines."}

To realize this practically, we propose a deep AIF framework\nthat integrates a diffusion policy as the policy model and a multiple timescale\nrecurrent state-space model (MTRSSM) as the world model. The diffusion policy\ngenerates diverse candidate actions while the MTRSSM predicts their\nlong-horizon consequences through latent imagination, enabling action selection\nthat minimizes EFE.
