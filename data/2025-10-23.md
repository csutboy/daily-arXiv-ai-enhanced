  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 月球极区永久阴影区地形复杂，适合腿式机器人探索，但现有外部传感器无法量化地形与机器人的物理交互，需要基于本体感知的地形映射方法。

Method: 开发了基于四足机器人内部传感的地形映射框架，在运动过程中估计高程、滑移、能耗和稳定性指标，并增量集成到多层2.5D网格地图中。

Result: 在模拟月球环境中使用21公斤Aliengo机器人进行测试，显示在月球重力和地形条件下具有一致的映射性能。

Conclusion: 提出的基于本体感知的地形交互映射框架能够有效量化地形物理特性，为月球探索任务中的机器人导航和决策提供重要信息。

Abstract: Permanently Shadowed Regions (PSRs) near the lunar poles are of interest for
future exploration due to their potential to contain water ice and preserve
geological records. Their complex, uneven terrain favors the use of legged
robots, which can traverse challenging surfaces while collecting in-situ data,
and have proven effective in Earth analogs, including dark caves, when equipped
with onboard lighting. While exteroceptive sensors like cameras and lidars can
capture terrain geometry and even semantic information, they cannot quantify
its physical interaction with the robot, a capability provided by
proprioceptive sensing. We propose a terrain mapping framework for quadruped
robots, which estimates elevation, foot slippage, energy cost, and stability
margins from internal sensing during locomotion. These metrics are
incrementally integrated into a multi-layer 2.5D gridmap that reflects terrain
interaction from the robot's perspective. The system is evaluated in a
simulator that mimics a lunar environment, using the 21 kg quadruped robot
Aliengo, showing consistent mapping performance under lunar gravity and terrain
conditions.

Abstract: In the past decade, the adoption of compact 3D range sensors, such as LiDARs,
has driven the developments of robust state-estimation pipelines, making them a
standard sensor for aerial, ground, and space autonomy. Unfortunately, poor
propagation of electromagnetic waves underwater, has limited the
visibility-independent sensing options of underwater state-estimation to
acoustic range sensors, which provide 2D information including, at-best,
spatially ambiguous information. This paper, to the best of our knowledge, is
the first study examining the performance, capacity, and opportunities arising
from the recent introduction of the first compact 3D sonar. Towards that
purpose, we introduce calibration procedures for extracting the extrinsics
between the 3D sonar and a camera and we provide a study on acoustic response
in different surfaces and materials. Moreover, we provide novel mapping and
SLAM pipelines tested in deployments in underwater cave systems and other
geometrically and acoustically challenging underwater environments. Our
assessment showcases the unique capacity of 3D sonars to capture consistent
spatial information allowing for detailed reconstructions and localization in
datasets expanding to hundreds of meters. At the same time it highlights
remaining challenges related to acoustic propagation, as found also in other
acoustic sensors. Datasets collected for our evaluations would be released and
shared with the community to enable further research advancements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下机器人缺乏类似陆地机器人的先进3D传感器能力，最近才出现3D声纳这种紧凑传感器，需要开发专门的水下3D导航解决方案。

Method: 提出传感器幻觉概念，从不存在但具有便利参数的传感器中生成测量数据，以适应新型传感器数据流并实现实时局部最优性能。

Abstract: Autonomous navigation in 3D is a fundamental problem for autonomy. Despite
major advancements in terrestrial and aerial settings due to improved range
sensors including LiDAR, compact sensors with similar capabilities for
underwater robots have only recently become available, in the form of 3D
sonars. This paper introduces a novel underwater 3D navigation pipeline, called
SHRUMS (Sensor Hallucination for Robust Underwater Motion planning with 3D
Sonar). To the best of the authors' knowledge, SHRUMS is the first underwater
autonomous navigation stack to integrate a 3D sonar. The proposed pipeline
exhibits strong robustness while operating in complex 3D environments in spite
of extremely poor visibility conditions. To accommodate the intricacies of the
novel sensor data stream while achieving real-time locally optimal performance,
SHRUMS introduces the concept of hallucinating sensor measurements from
non-existent sensors with convenient arbitrary parameters, tailored to
application specific requirements. The proposed concepts are validated with
real 3D sonar sensor data, utilizing real inputs in challenging settings and
local maps constructed in real-time. Field deployments validating the proposed
approach in full are planned in the very near future.

### [4] [$\nabla$-SDF: Learning Euclidean Signed Distance Functions Online with Gradient-Augmented Octree Interpolation and Neural Residual](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18999)
*Zhirui Dai,Qihao Qian,Tianxing Fan,Nikolay Atanasov*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合显式梯度增强八叉树插值和隐式神经残差的混合方法，用于从点云数据重建非截断的符号距离函数，在计算效率和精度之间取得了平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在在线大规模SDF重建中存在局限性：基于离散体积数据结构的方法影响SDF估计的连续性和可微性，而神经网络方法虽然精度高但效率低、存在灾难性遗忘和内存限制，且通常仅限于截断SDF。

Method: 提出∇-SDF混合方法，结合梯度增强八叉树插值提供的显式先验和隐式神经残差，实现非截断欧几里得SDF重建。

Result: 该方法在计算和内存效率上可与体积方法相媲美，在可微性和精度上可与神经网络方法相媲美，在准确性和效率方面优于现有技术。

Conclusion: ∇-SDF为机器人和计算机视觉中的下游任务提供了一个可扩展的解决方案，在SDF重建的效率和精度之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Estimation of signed distance functions (SDFs) from point cloud data has been
shown to benefit many robot autonomy capabilities, including localization,
mapping, motion planning, and control. Methods that support online and
large-scale SDF reconstruction tend to rely on discrete volumetric data
structures, which affect the continuity and differentiability of the SDF
estimates. Recently, using implicit features, neural network methods have
demonstrated high-fidelity and differentiable SDF reconstruction but they tend
to be less efficient, can experience catastrophic forgetting and memory
limitations in large environments, and are often restricted to truncated SDFs.
This work proposes $\nabla$-SDF, a hybrid method that combines an explicit
prior obtained from gradient-augmented octree interpolation with an implicit
neural residual. Our method achieves non-truncated (Euclidean) SDF
reconstruction with computational and memory efficiency comparable to
volumetric methods and differentiability and accuracy comparable to neural
network methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \methodname{}
outperforms the state of the art in terms of accuracy and efficiency, providing
a scalable solution for downstream tasks in robotics and computer vision.

### [5] [Motion Planning and Control of an Overactuated 4-Wheel Drive with Constrained Independent Steering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19054)
*Shiyu Liu,Ilija Hadzic,Akshay Gupta,Aliasghar Arab*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对四轮独立转向驱动系统的运动规划和控制方法，解决了机械约束导致的运动不连续性问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 四轮独立转向系统存在机械约束限制车轮不能360度旋转，导致配置空间受限并包含不连续性，影响机器人运动的平滑性

Method: 引入转向约束的数学公式化，推导速度空间中的不连续平面，设计考虑转向约束和速度过渡平滑性的运动规划器，控制器使用局部反馈生成驱动并处理不连续交叉

Result: 将运动规划器实现为ROS导航包的扩展，并在仿真和物理机器人上进行了系统评估

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够有效处理四轮独立转向系统的运动不连续性问题，实现平滑高效的运动控制

Abstract: This paper addresses motion planning and con- trol of an overactuated 4-wheel
drive train with independent steering (4WIS) where mechanical constraints
prevent the wheels from executing full 360-degree rotations (swerve). The
configuration space of such a robot is constrained and contains discontinuities
that affect the smoothness of the robot motion. We introduce a mathematical
formulation of the steering constraints and derive discontinuity planes that
partition the velocity space into regions of smooth and efficient motion. We
further design the motion planner for path tracking and ob- stacle avoidance
that explicitly accounts for swerve constraints and the velocity transition
smoothness. The motion controller uses local feedback to generate actuation
from the desired velocity, while properly handling the discontinuity crossing
by temporarily stopping the motion and repositioning the wheels. We implement
the proposed motion planner as an extension to ROS Navigation package and
evaluate the system in simulation and on a physical robot.

Conclusion: 该算法能够自主生成满足碰撞概率要求的最小能量机动方案，或在无法满足要求时提供最小风险解决方案，适用于低地球轨道卫星碰撞规避。

Abstract: Conjunction analysis and maneuver planning for spacecraft collision avoidance
remains a manual and time-consuming process, typically involving repeated
forward simulations of hand-designed maneuvers. With the growing density of
satellites in low-Earth orbit (LEO), autonomy is becoming essential for
efficiently evaluating and mitigating collisions. In this work, we present an
algorithm to design low-thrust collision-avoidance maneuvers for short-term
conjunction events. We first formulate the problem as a nonconvex
quadratically-constrained quadratic program (QCQP), which we then relax into a
convex semidefinite program (SDP) using Shor's relaxation. We demonstrate
empirically that the relaxation is tight, which enables the recovery of
globally optimal solutions to the original nonconvex problem. Our formulation
produces a minimum-energy solution while ensuring a desired probability of
collision at the time of closest approach. Finally, if the desired probability
of collision cannot be satisfied, we relax this constraint into a penalty,
yielding a minimum-risk solution. We validate our algorithm with a
high-fidelity simulation of a satellite conjunction in low-Earth orbit with a
simulated conjunction data message (CDM), demonstrating its effectiveness in
reducing collision risk.

Result: 仿真结果显示RMSE为6.14×10⁻⁴ m，稳定时间3.2s；实验验证平均RMSE为5.66×10⁻³ m，稳态误差8.05×10⁻³ m，稳定时间1.58s。

Conclusion: 该控制器有潜力提升软假肢系统的运动精度和响应性，推动自适应智能控制在可穿戴辅助设备中的集成。

Abstract: The functionality and natural motion of prosthetic hands remain limited by
the challenges in controlling compliant wrist mechanisms. Current control
strategies often lack adaptability and incur high computational costs, which
impedes real-time deployment in assistive robotics. To address this gap, this
study presents a computationally efficient Neural Network (NN)-based Model
Reference Adaptive Controller (MRAC) for a tendon-driven soft continuum wrist
integrated with a prosthetic hand. The dynamic modeling of the wrist is
formulated using Timoshenko beam theory, capturing both shear and bending
deformations. The proposed NN-MRAC estimates the required tendon forces from
deflection errors and minimizes deviation from a reference model through online
adaptation. Simulation results demonstrate improved precision with a root mean
square error (RMSE) of $6.14 \times 10^{-4}$ m and a settling time of $3.2$s.
Experimental validations confirm real-time applicability, with an average RMSE
of $5.66 \times 10^{-3}$ m, steady-state error of $8.05 \times 10^{-3}$ m, and
settling time of $1.58$ s. These results highlight the potential of the
controller to enhance motion accuracy and responsiveness in soft prosthetic
systems, thereby advancing the integration of adaptive intelligent control in
wearable assistive devices.

Abstract: This paper investigates a sample-based solution to the hybrid mode control
problem across non-differentiable and algorithmic hybrid modes. Our approach
reasons about a set of hybrid control modes as an integer-based optimization
problem where we select what mode to apply, when to switch to another mode, and
the duration for which we are in a given control mode. A sample-based variation
is derived to efficiently search the integer domain for optimal solutions. We
find our formulation yields strong performance guarantees that can be applied
to a number of robotics-related tasks. In addition, our approach is able to
synthesize complex algorithms and policies to compound behaviors and achieve
challenging tasks. Last, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in
real-world robotic examples that require reactive switching between long-term
planning and high-frequency control.

Abstract: Recent advances in robotics and autonomous systems have broadened the use of
robots in laboratory settings, including automated synthesis, scalable reaction
workflows, and collaborative tasks in self-driving laboratories (SDLs). This
paper presents a comprehensive development of a mobile manipulator designed to
assist human operators in such autonomous lab environments. Kinematic modeling
of the manipulator is carried out based on the Denavit Hartenberg (DH)
convention and inverse kinematics solution is determined to enable precise and
adaptive manipulation capabilities. A key focus of this research is enhancing
the manipulator ability to reliably grasp textured objects as a critical
component of autonomous handling tasks. Advanced vision-based algorithms are
implemented to perform real-time object detection and pose estimation, guiding
the manipulator in dynamic grasping and following tasks. In this work, we
integrate a vision method that combines feature-based detection with
homography-driven pose estimation, leveraging depth information to represent an
object pose as a $2$D planar projection within $3$D space. This adaptive
capability enables the system to accommodate variations in object orientation
and supports robust autonomous manipulation across diverse environments. By
enabling autonomous experimentation and human-robot collaboration, this work
contributes to the scalability and reproducibility of next-generation chemical
laboratories

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 腿式机器人虽然能通过力交互感知地形，但在高度可变形或不稳定地形中仍面临挑战，需要更可靠的可通行性评估方法。

Method: 使用高斯过程回归从腿-地形交互中在线估计安全区域和前沿区域，结合反应式控制器实现实时安全探索和导航。

Result: 在仿真中验证了SAEGT仅使用本体感知估计的可通行性就能安全探索并导航到指定目标。

Conclusion: SAEGT框架为腿式机器人在视觉失效的颗粒地形中提供了有效的安全导航解决方案。

Abstract: Legged robots can sense terrain through force interactions during locomotion,
offering more reliable traversability estimates than remote sensing and serving
as scouts for guiding wheeled rovers in challenging environments. However, even
legged scouts face challenges when traversing highly deformable or unstable
terrain. We present Safe Active Exploration for Granular Terrain (SAEGT), a
navigation framework that enables legged robots to safely explore unknown
granular environments using proprioceptive sensing, particularly where visual
input fails to capture terrain deformability. SAEGT estimates the safe region
and frontier region online from leg-terrain interactions using Gaussian Process
regression for traversability assessment, with a reactive controller for
real-time safe exploration and navigation. SAEGT demonstrated its ability to
safely explore and navigate toward a specified goal using only proprioceptively
estimated traversability in simulation.

TL;DR: GADGET是一个基于扩散模型的路径规划框架，能够在新环境和不同机器人上实现零样本迁移，无需重新训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高维复杂环境中机器人路径规划的计算效率低、参数调优困难以及现有学习方法泛化能力不足的问题。

Conclusion: GADGET能够生成安全、无碰撞的轨迹，在真实环境中表现出色，为机器人路径规划提供了有效的通用解决方案。

Abstract: Path planning for a robotic system in high-dimensional cluttered environments
needs to be efficient, safe, and adaptable for different environments and
hardware. Conventional methods face high computation time and require extensive
parameter tuning, while prior learning-based methods still fail to generalize
effectively. The primary goal of this research is to develop a path planning
framework capable of generalizing to unseen environments and new robotic
manipulators without the need for retraining. We present GADGET (Generalizable
and Adaptive Diffusion-Guided Environment-aware Trajectory generation), a
diffusion-based planning model that generates joint-space trajectories
conditioned on voxelized scene representations as well as start and goal
configurations. A key innovation is GADGET's hybrid dual-conditioning mechanism
that combines classifier-free guidance via learned scene encoding with
classifier-guided Control Barrier Function (CBF) safety shaping, integrating
environment awareness with real-time collision avoidance directly in the
denoising process. This design supports zero-shot transfer to new environments
and robotic embodiments without retraining. Experimental results show that
GADGET achieves high success rates with low collision intensity in
spherical-obstacle, bin-picking, and shelf environments, with CBF guidance
further improving safety. Moreover, comparative evaluations indicate strong
performance relative to both sampling-based and learning-based baselines.
Furthermore, GADGET provides transferability across Franka Panda, Kinova Gen3
(6/7-DoF), and UR5 robots, and physical execution on a Kinova Gen3 demonstrates
its ability to generate safe, collision-free trajectories in real-world
settings.

Conclusion: GRASPLAT证明了仅使用RGB图像训练就能实现有效的灵巧抓取，为在真实场景中部署多指手抓取系统提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Achieving dexterous robotic grasping with multi-fingered hands remains a
significant challenge. While existing methods rely on complete 3D scans to
predict grasp poses, these approaches face limitations due to the difficulty of
acquiring high-quality 3D data in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we
introduce GRASPLAT, a novel grasping framework that leverages consistent 3D
information while being trained solely on RGB images. Our key insight is that
by synthesizing physically plausible images of a hand grasping an object, we
can regress the corresponding hand joints for a successful grasp. To achieve
this, we utilize 3D Gaussian Splatting to generate high-fidelity novel views of
real hand-object interactions, enabling end-to-end training with RGB data.
Unlike prior methods, our approach incorporates a photometric loss that refines
grasp predictions by minimizing discrepancies between rendered and real images.
We conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world grasping
datasets, demonstrating that GRASPLAT improves grasp success rates up to 36.9%
over existing image-based methods. Project page:

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于可变形线性物体（DLO）长时程布线任务的自主分层框架，结合视觉语言模型进行高层推理和强化学习技能执行，在复杂布线场景中达到92.5%的成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决DLO（如电缆和绳索）在工业装配线和日常生活中的长时程布线任务挑战，这些任务需要长时程规划、可靠技能执行、适应非线性动力学和分解抽象布线目标。

Method: 使用分层框架：利用视觉语言模型进行上下文高层推理生成可行计划，通过强化学习训练的低层技能执行计划，并引入故障恢复机制将DLO重新定向到可插入状态。

Conclusion: 该分层框架能够有效处理DLO的长时程布线任务，具有强大的泛化能力和鲁棒性，为复杂机器人操作任务提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Long-horizon routing tasks of deformable linear objects (DLOs), such as
cables and ropes, are common in industrial assembly lines and everyday life.
These tasks are particularly challenging because they require robots to
manipulate DLO with long-horizon planning and reliable skill execution.
Successfully completing such tasks demands adapting to their nonlinear
dynamics, decomposing abstract routing goals, and generating multi-step plans
composed of multiple skills, all of which require accurate high-level reasoning
during execution. In this paper, we propose a fully autonomous hierarchical
framework for solving challenging DLO routing tasks. Given an implicit or
explicit routing goal expressed in language, our framework leverages
vision-language models~(VLMs) for in-context high-level reasoning to synthesize
feasible plans, which are then executed by low-level skills trained via
reinforcement learning. To improve robustness in long horizons, we further
introduce a failure recovery mechanism that reorients the DLO into
insertion-feasible states. Our approach generalizes to diverse scenes involving
object attributes, spatial descriptions, as well as implicit language commands.
It outperforms the next best baseline method by nearly 50% and achieves an
overall success rate of 92.5% across long-horizon routing scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出了TARMAC - 化学机器人操作分类法，这是一个用于定义和组织实验室实践中核心操作技能的领域特定框架，旨在解决化学实验室自动化中缺乏系统化操作技能描述的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前化学实验室自动化系统仍然依赖频繁的人工干预，现有的实验抽象通常只描述协议级步骤，而没有指定执行这些步骤所需的机器人操作，缺乏对实验室机器人所需操作技能的系统化描述。

Method: 基于标注的教学实验室演示和实验验证，TARMAC根据功能角色和物理执行要求对操作进行分类，可以实例化为机器人可执行的原语，并组合成更高级的宏操作。

Conclusion: TARMAC为化学实验室机器人操作提供了一个结构化的分类体系，通过定义可重用和可组合的操作原语，支持更灵活和自主的实验室自动化系统。

Abstract: Chemistry laboratory automation aims to increase throughput, reproducibility,
and safety, yet many existing systems still depend on frequent human
intervention. Advances in robotics have reduced this dependency, but without a
structured representation of the required skills, autonomy remains limited to
bespoke, task-specific solutions with little capacity to transfer beyond their
initial design. Current experiment abstractions typically describe
protocol-level steps without specifying the robotic actions needed to execute
them. This highlights the lack of a systematic account of the manipulation
skills required for robots in chemistry laboratories. To address this gap, we
introduce TARMAC - a Taxonomy for Robot Manipulation in Chemistry - a
domain-specific framework that defines and organizes the core manipulations
needed in laboratory practice. Based on annotated teaching-lab demonstrations
and supported by experimental validation, TARMAC categorizes actions according
to their functional role and physical execution requirements. Beyond serving as
a descriptive vocabulary, TARMAC can be instantiated as robot-executable
primitives and composed into higher-level macros, enabling skill reuse and
supporting scalable integration into long-horizon workflows. These
contributions provide a structured foundation for more flexible and autonomous
laboratory automation. More information is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流匹配方法在机器人模仿学习中应用广泛，但面临推理时间高的问题。现有的蒸馏方法和一致性方法性能难以与原始扩散模型和流匹配模型竞争。

Method: 在捷径模型基础上扩展多步一致性损失，将一步损失拆分为多步损失；提出自适应梯度分配方法解决多步损失和原始流匹配损失的不稳定优化问题。

Result: 在两个仿真基准和五个真实环境任务中验证了算法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持快速推理的同时提升了性能，解决了流匹配方法在机器人模仿学习中的推理效率问题。

Abstract: The wide application of flow-matching methods has greatly promoted the
development of robot imitation learning. However, these methods all face the
problem of high inference time. To address this issue, researchers have
proposed distillation methods and consistency methods, but the performance of
these methods still struggles to compete with that of the original diffusion
models and flow-matching models. In this article, we propose a one-step
shortcut method with multi-step integration for robot imitation learning. To
balance the inference speed and performance, we extend the multi-step
consistency loss on the basis of the shortcut model, split the one-step loss
into multi-step losses, and improve the performance of one-step inference.
Secondly, to solve the problem of unstable optimization of the multi-step loss
and the original flow-matching loss, we propose an adaptive gradient allocation
method to enhance the stability of the learning process. Finally, we evaluate
the proposed method in two simulation benchmarks and five real-world
environment tasks. The experimental results verify the effectiveness of the
proposed algorithm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 海洋探测需求增长，需要在受限环境中进行检测和干预。Eely的细长外形和可变体态使其适合此类环境，但操作面临不确定环境、极端条件和导航能力受限等挑战。

Method: 采用贝叶斯方法来评估Eely在两种任务场景中的丢失风险，并进行敏感性分析。

Result: 通过敏感性分析识别出对Eely丢失影响最大的因素。

Conclusion: 该方法有助于提高Eely的性能和任务成功率。

Abstract: The growing interest in ocean discovery imposes a need for inspection and
intervention in confined and demanding environments. Eely's slender shape, in
addition to its ability to change its body configurations, makes articulated
underwater robots an adequate option for such environments. However, operation
of Eely in such environments imposes demanding requirements on the system, as
it must deal with uncertain and unstructured environments, extreme
environmental conditions, and reduced navigational capabilities. This paper
proposes a Bayesian approach to assess the risks of losing Eely during two
mission scenarios. The goal of this work is to improve Eely's performance and
the likelihood of mission success. Sensitivity analysis results are presented
in order to demonstrate the causes having the highest impact on losing Eely.

Method: 构建概率世界模型来显式建模terrain参数的空间相关偶然不确定性，并通过可微分物理引擎传播这种不确定性进行概率轨迹预测，利用结构化卷积算子实现高效计算。

Conclusion: 该概率框架能够有效处理越野环境中的空间相关不确定性，为下游可通行性估计和安全自主导航提供可靠支持。

Abstract: Uncertainty-aware robot motion prediction is crucial for downstream
traversability estimation and safe autonomous navigation in unstructured,
off-road environments, where terrain is heterogeneous and perceptual
uncertainty is high. Most existing methods assume deterministic or spatially
independent terrain uncertainties, ignoring the inherent local correlations of
3D spatial data and often producing unreliable predictions. In this work, we
introduce an efficient probabilistic framework that explicitly models spatially
correlated aleatoric uncertainty over terrain parameters as a probabilistic
world model and propagates this uncertainty through a differentiable physics
engine for probabilistic trajectory forecasting. By leveraging structured
convolutional operators, our approach provides high-resolution multivariate
predictions at manageable computational cost. Experimental evaluation on a
publicly available dataset shows significantly improved uncertainty estimation
and trajectory prediction accuracy over aleatoric uncertainty estimation
baselines.

TL;DR: 提出一种简单的采样策略来解决机器人任务数据集中物理动作不平衡的问题，只需几行代码即可集成到现有代码库中，提高模型泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人任务数据集虽然任务描述不同，但许多涉及相似的物理动作序列，导致数据集在物理动作表示上存在严重不平衡。

Method: 提出一种简单的采样策略，在策略训练中缓解这种不平衡问题，该方法易于集成到现有代码库中。

Result: 在预训练小模型和微调大型基础模型中都显示出显著改进，特别是在低资源任务上相比现有方法有大幅提升，且不会降低高资源任务的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法能更有效地利用多任务策略的模型容量，并在真实机器人设置中得到验证。

Abstract: Increasingly large datasets of robot actions and sensory observations are
being collected to train ever-larger neural networks. These datasets are
collected based on tasks and while these tasks may be distinct in their
descriptions, many involve very similar physical action sequences (e.g., 'pick
up an apple' versus 'pick up an orange'). As a result, many datasets of robotic
tasks are substantially imbalanced in terms of the physical robotic actions
they represent. In this work, we propose a simple sampling strategy for policy
training that mitigates this imbalance. Our method requires only a few lines of
code to integrate into existing codebases and improves generalization. We
evaluate our method in both pre-training small models and fine-tuning large
foundational models. Our results show substantial improvements on low-resource
tasks compared to prior state-of-the-art methods, without degrading performance
on high-resource tasks. This enables more effective use of model capacity for
multi-task policies. We also further validate our approach in a real-world
setup on a Franka Panda robot arm across a diverse set of tasks.

TL;DR: GigaBrain-0是一个利用世界模型生成数据来训练视觉-语言-动作模型的新方法，显著减少对真实机器人数据的依赖，同时提升跨任务泛化能力和策略鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视觉-语言-动作模型训练需要大量真实机器人数据，收集成本高且效率低，限制了模型的扩展性和泛化能力。

Method: 使用世界模型生成多样化数据（视频生成、真实到真实迁移、人类迁移、视角迁移、仿真到真实迁移），结合RGBD输入建模和具身思维链监督来提升策略鲁棒性。

Result: 在灵巧操作、长时程任务和移动操作任务上实现显著性能提升，在外观、物体放置和相机视角变化方面表现出优异的泛化能力。

Conclusion: GigaBrain-0通过世界模型生成数据有效解决了真实数据收集瓶颈，为通用机器人VLA模型的发展提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Training Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for generalist robots typically
requires large-scale real-world robot data, which is expensive and
time-consuming to collect. The inefficiency of physical data collection
severely limits the scalability, and generalization capacity of current VLA
systems. To address this challenge, we introduce GigaBrain-0, a novel VLA
foundation model empowered by world model-generated data (e.g., video
generation, real2real transfer, human transfer, view transfer, sim2real
transfer data). By leveraging world models to generate diverse data at scale,
GigaBrain-0 significantly reduces reliance on real robot data while improving
cross-task generalization. Our approach further improves policy robustness
through RGBD input modeling and embodied Chain-of-Thought (CoT) supervision,
enabling the model to reason about spatial geometry, object states, and
long-horizon dependencies during task execution. This leads to substantial
gains in real-world performance on dexterous, long-horizon, and mobile
manipulation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GigaBrain-0 achieves
superior generalization across variations in appearances (e.g., textures,
colors), object placements, and camera viewpoints. Additionally, we present
GigaBrain-0-Small, an optimized lightweight variant designed to run efficiently
on devices such as the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模仿学习依赖高质量专家数据，限制了在多样化现实场景中的适应性。非专家数据（如游戏数据、次优演示）覆盖范围更广且收集成本更低，但现有方法无法有效利用这些数据

Method: 提出简单的算法修改，通过扩大策略分布的支持范围，让离线强化学习能够在稀疏数据覆盖的现实场景中有效利用非专家数据

Result: 在操作任务中显著提高了学习策略在更广泛初始条件下的成功率，能够利用包括部分或次优演示在内的所有收集数据来增强任务导向策略性能

Conclusion: 算法技术对于利用非专家数据进行鲁棒策略学习在机器人领域具有重要意义

Abstract: Imitation learning has proven effective for training robots to perform
complex tasks from expert human demonstrations. However, it remains limited by
its reliance on high-quality, task-specific data, restricting adaptability to
the diverse range of real-world object configurations and scenarios. In
contrast, non-expert data -- such as play data, suboptimal demonstrations,
partial task completions, or rollouts from suboptimal policies -- can offer
broader coverage and lower collection costs. However, conventional imitation
learning approaches fail to utilize this data effectively. To address these
challenges, we posit that with right design decisions, offline reinforcement
learning can be used as a tool to harness non-expert data to enhance the
performance of imitation learning policies. We show that while standard offline
RL approaches can be ineffective at actually leveraging non-expert data under
the sparse data coverage settings typically encountered in the real world,
simple algorithmic modifications can allow for the utilization of this data,
without significant additional assumptions. Our approach shows that broadening
the support of the policy distribution can allow imitation algorithms augmented
by offline RL to solve tasks robustly, showing considerably enhanced recovery
and generalization behavior. In manipulation tasks, these innovations
significantly increase the range of initial conditions where learned policies
are successful when non-expert data is incorporated. Moreover, we show that
these methods are able to leverage all collected data, including partial or
suboptimal demonstrations, to bolster task-directed policy performance. This
underscores the importance of algorithmic techniques for using non-expert data
for robust policy learning in robotics.

Conclusion: 这项研究为智能假肢系统提供了一个有前景的方向，对机器人学和生物医学工程领域做出了贡献。

Abstract: The integration of advanced control strategies into prosthetic hands is
essential to improve their adaptability and performance. In this study, we
present an implementation of a Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategy to
regulate the motions of a soft continuum wrist section attached to a
tendon-driven prosthetic hand with less computational effort. MPC plays a
crucial role in enhancing the functionality and responsiveness of prosthetic
hands. By leveraging predictive modeling, this approach enables precise
movement adjustments while accounting for dynamic user interactions. This
advanced control strategy allows for the anticipation of future movements and
adjustments based on the current state of the prosthetic device and the
intentions of the user. Kinematic and dynamic modelings are performed using
Euler-Bernoulli beam and Lagrange methods respectively. Through simulation and
experimental validations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of MPC in optimizing
wrist articulation and user control. Our findings suggest that this technique
significantly improves the prosthetic hand dexterity, making movements more
natural and intuitive. This research contributes to the field of robotics and
biomedical engineering by offering a promising direction for intelligent
prosthetic systems.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: LaViRA是一个零样本视觉语言导航框架，通过语言-视觉-机器人的层次化动作分解，在未见环境中实现基于自然语言指令的导航，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决零样本视觉语言导航中的关键权衡问题：要么依赖环境特定的路径点预测器限制场景泛化，要么在导航过程中未充分利用大模型的推理能力。

Method: 提出LaViRA框架，将动作分解为三个层次：语言动作用于高层规划、视觉动作用于感知接地、机器人动作用于鲁棒导航，利用不同规模多模态大语言模型的优势。

Result: 在VLN-CE基准测试中显著优于现有最先进方法，在未见环境中展现出优越的泛化能力。

Conclusion: LaViRA通过模块化分解实现了强大的推理、接地和实际控制能力，同时保持透明度和效率，适合实际部署。

Abstract: Zero-shot Vision-and-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE)
requires an agent to navigate unseen environments based on natural language
instructions without any prior training. Current methods face a critical
trade-off: either rely on environment-specific waypoint predictors that limit
scene generalization, or underutilize the reasoning capabilities of large
models during navigation. We introduce LaViRA, a simple yet effective zero-shot
framework that addresses this dilemma by decomposing action into a
coarse-to-fine hierarchy: Language Action for high-level planning, Vision
Action for perceptual grounding, and Robot Action for robust navigation. This
modular decomposition allows us to leverage the distinct strengths of different
scales of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) at each stage, creating a
system that is powerful in its reasoning, grounding and practical control.
LaViRA significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on the
VLN-CE benchmark, demonstrating superior generalization capabilities in unseen
environments, while maintaining transparency and efficiency for real-world
deployment.

Motivation: 为敏捷无人机群的实时定位系统提供快速机载检测能力，特别是在低端无人机和微型飞行器上的应用可行性。

Method: 开发了三种并行架构：CPU优化程序、GPU着色器程序和功能等效的FPGA流架构，用于快速检测视觉相对定位中的孤立标记。

Result: CPU和GPU解决方案的每像素平均处理时间比现有技术快2-3个数量级，FPGA架构通过最小化从相机曝光到检测结果的总延迟提供了最显著的总体加速。

Conclusion: 该方法已成为敏捷无人机群的关键使能技术，在各种32位和64位嵌入式平台上验证了其效率和可行性。

Abstract: A novel approach for the fast onboard detection of isolated markers for
visual relative localisation of multiple teammates in agile UAV swarms is
introduced in this paper. As the detection forms a key component of real-time
localisation systems, a three-fold innovation is presented, consisting of an
optimised procedure for CPUs, a GPU shader program, and a functionally
equivalent FPGA streaming architecture. For the proposed CPU and GPU solutions,
the mean processing time per pixel of input camera frames was accelerated by
two to three orders of magnitude compared to the state of the art. For the
localisation task, the proposed FPGA architecture offered the most significant
overall acceleration by minimising the total delay from camera exposure to
detection results. Additionally, the proposed solutions were evaluated on
various 32-bit and 64-bit embedded platforms to demonstrate their efficiency,
as well as their feasibility for applications using low-end UAVs and MAVs.
Thus, it has become a crucial enabling technology for agile UAV swarming.

TL;DR: LITEN方法通过将VLA低级策略与高级VLM连接，利用过去经验进行上下文学习，使机器人能够在失败时动态调整行为策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉-语言-动作模型缺乏在任务失败时动态调整行为的能力，无法像人类一样从失败中学习并改进策略。

Method: LITEN在推理阶段和执行评估阶段之间迭代：推理阶段生成并执行低级VLA计划，评估阶段反思执行结果并提取有用结论用于后续推理。

Result: 实验结果表明LITEN能够有效从过去经验中学习，生成使用高可用性指令来完成长时程任务的计划。

Conclusion: LITEN通过连接高低级模型并利用上下文学习，成功实现了机器人从失败经验中学习并改进行为策略的能力。

Abstract: Solving complex real-world control tasks often takes multiple tries: if we
fail at first, we reflect on what went wrong, and change our strategy
accordingly to avoid making the same mistake. In robotics,
Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) offer a promising path towards solving
complex control tasks, but lack the ability to contextually and dynamically
readjust behavior when they fail to accomplish a task. In this work, we
introduce Learning from Inference-Time Execution (LITEN), which connects a VLA
low-level policy to a high-level VLM that conditions on past experiences by
including them in-context, allowing it to learn the affordances and
capabilities of the low-level VLA. Our approach iterates between a reasoning
phase that generates and executes plans for the low-level VLA, and an
assessment phase that reflects on the resulting execution and draws useful
conclusions to be included in future reasoning contexts. Unlike similar
approaches to self-refinement in non-robotics domains, LITEN must reflect on
unstructured real-world robot trajectories (e.g., raw videos), which requires
structured guiderails during assessment. Our experimental results demonstrate
LITEN is able to effectively learn from past experience to generate plans that
use high-affordance instructions to accomplish long-horizon tasks.

Motivation: 现有基于学习的方法依赖单步路径点预测，缺乏长期环境理解，导致探索效率不高。需要增强智能体对环境的长期理解能力。

Method: 提出迭代预测-探索框架，基于当前观测显式预测地图缺失区域，利用实际累积地图与预测全局地图的差异指导探索，并设计基于强化学习的奖励机制更新长期探索策略。

Conclusion: SEA方法通过语义地图预测和强化学习分层策略，有效提升了机器人探索的效率和准确性。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose SEA, a novel approach for active robot exploration
through semantic map prediction and a reinforcement learning-based hierarchical
exploration policy. Unlike existing learning-based methods that rely on
one-step waypoint prediction, our approach enhances the agent's long-term
environmental understanding to facilitate more efficient exploration. We
propose an iterative prediction-exploration framework that explicitly predicts
the missing areas of the map based on current observations. The difference
between the actual accumulated map and the predicted global map is then used to
guide exploration. Additionally, we design a novel reward mechanism that
leverages reinforcement learning to update the long-term exploration
strategies, enabling us to construct an accurate semantic map within limited
steps. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art exploration strategies, achieving superior
coverage ares of the global map within the same time constraints.

*Precious Eze,Stephanie Lunn,Bruk Berhane*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 该研究评估了6个大型语言模型在描述非洲10个国家计算职业期望方面的表现，发现开源模型在上下文意识和技能平衡方面表现更好，但所有模型都存在文化敏感性和基础设施考虑不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 雇主期望毕业生在工作中使用LLMs，但非洲计算岗位所需能力因国家背景不同而存在差异，需要明确这些能力要求。

Method: 使用Computing Curricula 2020框架，结合数字殖民主义理论和Ubuntu哲学，分析6个LLM对标准化提示的60个响应。

Result: 开源模型在9/10国家中得分最高，表现出更强的上下文意识；所有模型平均上下文意识仅为35.4%，存在西方中心偏见。

Conclusion: 非洲计算能力要求差异很大，需要去殖民化的AI教育方法，强调上下文相关性，开源模型在资源受限环境中表现优异。

Abstract: Employers increasingly expect graduates to utilize large language models
(LLMs) in the workplace, yet the competencies needed for computing roles across
Africa remain unclear given varying national contexts. This study examined how
six LLMs, namely ChatGPT 4, DeepSeek, Gemini, Claude 3.5, Llama 3, and Mistral
AI, describe entry-level computing career expectations across ten African
countries. Using the Computing Curricula 2020 framework and drawing on Digital
Colonialism Theory and Ubuntu Philosophy, we analyzed 60 LLM responses to
standardized prompts. Technical skills such as cloud computing and programming
appeared consistently, but notable differences emerged in how models addressed
non-technical competencies, particularly ethics and responsible AI use. Models
varied considerably in recognizing country-specific factors, including local
technology ecosystems, language requirements, and national policies.
Open-source models demonstrated stronger contextual awareness and a better
balance between technical and professional skills, earning top scores in nine
of ten countries. Still, all models struggled with cultural sensitivity and
infrastructure considerations, averaging only 35.4% contextual awareness. This
first broad comparison of LLM career guidance for African computing students
uncovers entrenched infrastructure assumptions and Western-centric biases,
creating gaps between technical recommendations and local needs. The strong
performance of cost-effective open-source models (Llama: 4.47/5; DeepSeek:
4.25/5) compared to proprietary alternatives (ChatGPT 4: 3.90/5; Claude:
3.46/5) challenges assumptions about AI tool quality in resource-constrained
settings. Our findings highlight how computing competency requirements vary
widely across Africa and underscore the need for decolonial approaches to AI in
education that emphasize contextual relevance

Motivation: 计算课程特别是涉及AI/ML公平与伦理的课程，需要理解如何解决实现公平结果的障碍，课程大纲分析可以评估课程的覆盖范围、深度和实践，但人工评估耗时且不一致。

Method: 开发了面向公平的评分标准，使用大语言模型通过多视角角色模拟（教师、系主任、机构评审员、外部评估员）评估24门课程大纲，并识别主题趋势。

Result: 多视角评估能够注意到细微的、角色特定的优先级，利用这些优先级填补AI/ML及相关计算课程在公平与伦理课程设计中的隐藏差距。

Conclusion: 这些见解为改进此类课程中公平、伦理和正义内容的设计和交付提供了具体方向。

Abstract: Course syllabi set the tone and expectations for courses, shaping the
learning experience for both students and instructors. In computing courses,
especially those addressing fairness and ethics in artificial intelligence
(AI), machine learning (ML), and algorithmic design, it is imperative that we
understand how approaches to navigating barriers to fair outcomes are being
addressed.These expectations should be inclusive, transparent, and grounded in
promoting critical thinking. Syllabus analysis offers a way to evaluate the
coverage, depth, practices, and expectations within a course. Manual syllabus
evaluation, however, is time-consuming and prone to inconsistency. To address
this, we developed a justice-oriented scoring rubric and asked a large language
model (LLM) to review syllabi through a multi-perspective role simulation.
Using this rubric, we evaluated 24 syllabi from four perspectives: instructor,
departmental chair, institutional reviewer, and external evaluator. We also
prompted the LLM to identify thematic trends across the courses. Findings show
that multiperspective evaluation aids us in noting nuanced, role-specific
priorities, leveraging them to fill hidden gaps in curricula design of AI/ML
and related computing courses focused on fairness and ethics. These insights
offer concrete directions for improving the design and delivery of fairness,
ethics, and justice content in such courses.

Motivation: 数字平台经济虽然提供了新的就业机会和灵活性，但也导致了经济剥削加剧、职业隔离和工作条件恶化，算法管理对边缘群体造成不成比例的影响，强化了性别和种族不平等。

Method: 运用女权主义理论分析数字平台工作中的权力结构，提出了包含四个关键维度的分析框架：(i)不稳定性和剥削，(ii)监控和控制，(iii)就业边界模糊，(iv)殖民遗留问题。

Result: 研究揭示了数字平台工作如何通过算法管理强化资本主义体系内的权力不平衡，特别对边缘化群体造成负面影响。

Abstract: The rapid growth of the digital platform economy is transforming labor
markets, offering new employment opportunities with promises of flexibility and
accessibility. However, these benefits often come at the expense of increased
economic exploitation, occupational segregation, and deteriorating working
conditions. Research highlights that algorithmic management disproportionately
impacts marginalized groups, reinforcing gendered and racial inequalities while
deepening power imbalances within capitalist systems. This study seeks to
elucidate the complex nature of digital platform work by drawing on feminist
theories that have historically scrutinized and contested the structures of
power within society, especially in the workplace. It presents a framework
focused on four key dimensions to lay a foundation for future research: (i)
precarity and exploitation, (ii) surveillance and control, (iii) blurring
employment boundaries, and (iv) colonial legacies. It advocates for
participatory research, transparency in platform governance, and structural
changes to promote more equitable conditions for digital platform workers.

Abstract: Natural disasters always have several effects on human lives. It is
challenging for governments to tackle these incidents and to rebuild the
economic, social and physical infrastructures and facilities with the available
resources (mainly budget and time). Governments always define plans and
policies according to the law and political strategies that should maximise
social benefits. The severity of damage and the vast resources needed to bring
life back to normality make such reconstruction a challenge. This article is
the extension of our previously published work by conducting comprehensive
comparative analysis by integrating additional deep learning models plus random
agent which is used as a baseline. Our prior research introduced a decision
support system by using the Deep Reinforcement Learning technique for the
planning of post-disaster city reconstruction, maximizing the social benefit of
the reconstruction process, considering available resources, meeting the needs
of the broad community stakeholders (like citizens' social benefits and
politicians' priorities) and keeping in consideration city's structural
constraints (like dependencies among roads and buildings). The proposed
approach, named post disaster REbuilding plAn ProvIdeR (REPAIR) is generic. It
can determine a set of alternative plans for local administrators who select
the ideal one to implement, and it can be applied to areas of any extension. We
show the application of REPAIR in a real use case, i.e., to the L'Aquila
reconstruction process, damaged in 2009 by a major earthquake.

### [30] [Integrating Transparent Models, LLMs, and Practitioner-in-the-Loop: A Case of Nonprofit Program Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19799)
*Ji Ma,Albert Casella*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一个结合透明决策树模型与大语言模型的实践者参与工作流程，旨在提高AI工具的预测准确性、可解释性和实用性，促进公共和非营利组织对AI的负责任采用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公共和非营利组织通常不愿采用AI工具，因为大多数模型不透明，且标准方法通常分析聚合模式而非提供可操作的具体案例指导。

Method: 采用实践者参与循环工作流程，将透明决策树模型与LLMs配对，通过决策树识别关键预测因子，然后将树结构提供给LLM以生成基于透明模型的案例级预测。实践者参与特征工程、模型设计、解释审查和可用性评估全过程。

Result: 整合透明模型、LLMs和实践者输入能够产生准确、可信且可操作的案例级评估。

Conclusion: 该方法为公共和非营利部门负责任地采用AI提供了一条可行路径，通过结合透明模型、LLMs和实践者专业知识，实现了准确、可信且可操作的AI应用。

Abstract: Public and nonprofit organizations often hesitate to adopt AI tools because
most models are opaque even though standard approaches typically analyze
aggregate patterns rather than offering actionable, case-level guidance. This
study tests a practitioner-in-the-loop workflow that pairs transparent
decision-tree models with large language models (LLMs) to improve predictive
accuracy, interpretability, and the generation of practical insights. Using
data from an ongoing college-success program, we build interpretable decision
trees to surface key predictors. We then provide each tree's structure to an
LLM, enabling it to reproduce case-level predictions grounded in the
transparent models. Practitioners participate throughout feature engineering,
model design, explanation review, and usability assessment, ensuring that field
expertise informs the analysis at every stage. Results show that integrating
transparent models, LLMs, and practitioner input yields accurate, trustworthy,
and actionable case-level evaluations, offering a viable pathway for
responsible AI adoption in the public and nonprofit sectors.

TL;DR: 研究发现LLM智能体在社交网络中的意见更新遵循S型曲线，不同模型具有不同的从众阈值，并揭示了"说服不对称性"现象，即从肯定到否定与从否定到肯定的认知努力不同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型智能体在社交网络中如何受同伴压力影响更新意见，探索其与传统从众假设的差异。

Method: 将LLM智能体嵌入社交网络，让它们基于同伴观点更新意见，测试不同认知承诺水平下的行为模式。

Result: 发现智能体遵循S型曲线响应模式，不同模型具有不同的从众阈值，并识别出"说服不对称性"和"双重认知层次"现象。

Conclusion: 多智能体AI系统的决策受制于流动的、情境依赖的架构而非静态逻辑，这为审计其涌现的社会认知行为提供了新框架。

Abstract: We investigate how peer pressure influences the opinions of Large Language
Model (LLM) agents across a spectrum of cognitive commitments by embedding them
in social networks where they update opinions based on peer perspectives. Our
findings reveal key departures from traditional conformity assumptions. First,
agents follow a sigmoid curve: stable at low pressure, shifting sharply at
threshold, and saturating at high. Second, conformity thresholds vary by model:
Gemini 1.5 Flash requires over 70% peer disagreement to flip, whereas
ChatGPT-4o-mini shifts with a dissenting minority. Third, we uncover a
fundamental "persuasion asymmetry," where shifting an opinion from
affirmative-to-negative requires a different cognitive effort than the reverse.
This asymmetry results in a "dual cognitive hierarchy": the stability of
cognitive constructs inverts based on the direction of persuasion. For
instance, affirmatively-held core values are robust against opposition but
easily adopted from a negative stance, a pattern that inverts for other
constructs like attitudes. These dynamics echoing complex human biases like
negativity bias, prove robust across different topics and discursive frames
(moral, economic, sociotropic). This research introduces a novel framework for
auditing the emergent socio-cognitive behaviors of multi-agent AI systems,
demonstrating their decision-making is governed by a fluid, context-dependent
architecture, not a static logic.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI在STEM教育中的快速集成带来了变革性机遇，但也存在算法偏见、学生隐私和加剧教育不平等等伦理挑战，需要建立负责任集成框架。

Method: 通过伦理视角分析AI在STEM课堂的影响，提出三阶段实施路线图（准备、试点、扩展）和分层专业发展模型，强调公平中心设计。

Result: 确定了当前AI教育研究的关键差距，特别是缺乏学科特定的负责任集成框架，开发了结合技术AI素养与伦理推理的框架。

Conclusion: 通过弥合理论与实践，提出了优先考虑教学完整性、公平性和学生自主权的研究支持方法，确保AI成为包容性、以人为本的STEM教育工具。

Abstract: The rapid integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into K-12 STEM
education presents transformative opportunities alongside significant ethical
challenges. While AI-powered tools such as Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS),
automated assessments, and predictive analytics enhance personalized learning
and operational efficiency, they also risk perpetuating algorithmic bias,
eroding student privacy, and exacerbating educational inequities. This paper
examines the dual-edged impact of AI in STEM classrooms, analyzing its benefits
(e.g., adaptive learning, real-time feedback) and drawbacks (e.g., surveillance
risks, pedagogical limitations) through an ethical lens. We identify critical
gaps in current AI education research, particularly the lack of
subject-specific frameworks for responsible integration and propose a
three-phased implementation roadmap paired with a tiered professional
development model for educators. Our framework emphasizes equity-centered
design, combining technical AI literacy with ethical reasoning to foster
critical engagement among students. Key recommendations include mandatory bias
audits, low-resource adaptation strategies, and policy alignment to ensure AI
serves as a tool for inclusive, human-centered STEM education. By bridging
theory and practice, this work advances a research-backed approach to AI
integration that prioritizes pedagogical integrity, equity, and student agency
in an increasingly algorithmic world. Keywords: Artificial Intelligence, STEM
education, algorithmic bias, ethical AI, K-12 pedagogy, equity in education

Conclusion: 该设计为机构提供了一个可跨学科实施和试验的基于文献的前瞻性方案，能够解决博士指导中的现有痛点，同时通过防护措施降低AI过度依赖和虚假学习感知的风险。

Abstract: This study presents a design science blueprint for an orchestrated AI
assistant and co-pilot in doctoral supervision that acts as a socio-technical
mediator. Design requirements are derived from Stakeholder Theory and bounded
by Academic Integrity. We consolidated recent evidence on supervision gaps and
student wellbeing, then mapped issues to adjacent large language model
capabilities using a transparent severity-mitigability triage. The artefact
assembles existing capabilities into one accountable agentic AI workflow that
proposes retrieval-augmented generation and temporal knowledge graphs, as well
as mixture-of-experts routing as a solution stack of technologies to address
existing doctoral supervision pain points. Additionally, a student context
store is proposed, which introduces behaviour patches that turn tacit guidance
into auditable practice and student-set thresholds that trigger progress
summaries, while keeping authorship and final judgement with people. We specify
a student-initiated moderation loop in which assistant outputs are routed to a
supervisor for review and patching, and we analyse a reconfigured stakeholder
ecosystem that makes information explicit and accountable. Risks in such a
system exist, and among others, include AI over-reliance and the potential for
the illusion of learning, while guardrails are proposed. The contribution is an
ex ante, literature-grounded design with workflow and governance rules that
institutions can implement and trial across disciplines.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖文本输入，忽视了视觉感知在网页GUI交互中对人类决策的重要影响，需要缩小合成代理与真实用户之间的差距。

Method: 使用SFT进行联合动作预测和原理生成，结合动作历史、HTML观察和当前网页截图；集成RL与分层奖励结构，通过难度感知因子优先处理挑战性决策点。

Conclusion: 多模态基础不仅提高了预测准确性，还增强了视觉复杂环境中的模拟保真度，捕捉了纯文本代理经常遗漏的人类注意力和决策细微差别。

Abstract: LLMs have recently demonstrated strong potential in simulating online shopper
behavior. Prior work has improved action prediction by applying SFT on action
traces with LLM-generated rationales, and by leveraging RL to further enhance
reasoning capabilities. Despite these advances, current approaches rely on
text-based inputs and overlook the essential role of visual perception in
shaping human decision-making during web GUI interactions. In this paper, we
investigate the integration of visual information, specifically webpage
screenshots, into behavior simulation via VLMs, leveraging OPeRA dataset. By
grounding agent decision-making in both textual and visual modalities, we aim
to narrow the gap between synthetic agents and real-world users, thereby
enabling more cognitively aligned simulations of online shopping behavior.
Specifically, we employ SFT for joint action prediction and rationale
generation, conditioning on the full interaction context, which comprises
action history, past HTML observations, and the current webpage screenshot. To
further enhance reasoning capabilities, we integrate RL with a hierarchical
reward structure, scaled by a difficulty-aware factor that prioritizes
challenging decision points. Empirically, our studies show that incorporating
visual grounding yields substantial gains: the combination of text and image
inputs improves exact match accuracy by more than 6% over text-only inputs.
These results indicate that multi-modal grounding not only boosts predictive
accuracy but also enhances simulation fidelity in visually complex
environments, which captures nuances of human attention and decision-making
that text-only agents often miss. Finally, we revisit the design space of
behavior simulation frameworks, identify key methodological limitations, and
propose future research directions toward building efficient and effective
human behavior simulators.

Method: SWM-AP方法学习社会世界模型，从交互轨迹推断智能体特质，并基于特质预测智能体对部署机制的响应。机制设计策略通过与社会世界模型交互收集训练轨迹，同时在现实交互中在线推断智能体特质以提升学习效率。

Result: 在税收政策设计、团队协调和设施选址等多样化设置中，SWM-AP在累积奖励和样本效率方面优于现有的基于模型和无模型的强化学习基线方法。

Conclusion: 社会世界模型为异构复杂系统中的机制设计提供了有前景的途径，SWM-AP方法在多个实际场景中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Designing adaptive mechanisms to align individual and collective interests
remains a central challenge in artificial social intelligence. Existing methods
often struggle with modeling heterogeneous agents possessing persistent latent
traits (e.g., skills, preferences) and dealing with complex multi-agent system
dynamics. These challenges are compounded by the critical need for high sample
efficiency due to costly real-world interactions. World Models, by learning to
predict environmental dynamics, offer a promising pathway to enhance mechanism
design in heterogeneous and complex systems. In this paper, we introduce a
novel method named SWM-AP (Social World Model-Augmented Mechanism Design Policy
Learning), which learns a social world model hierarchically modeling agents'
behavior to enhance mechanism design. Specifically, the social world model
infers agents' traits from their interaction trajectories and learns a
trait-based model to predict agents' responses to the deployed mechanisms. The
mechanism design policy collects extensive training trajectories by interacting
with the social world model, while concurrently inferring agents' traits online
during real-world interactions to further boost policy learning efficiency.
Experiments in diverse settings (tax policy design, team coordination, and
facility location) demonstrate that SWM-AP outperforms established model-based
and model-free RL baselines in cumulative rewards and sample efficiency.

Motivation: 研究旨在探索如何将AI应用从单纯的自动化工具转变为创新伙伴，并培养学生对AI使用的批判性思考能力。

Method: 在AI增强设计课程中，要求学生通过结构化反思表格和设计简报，评估AI是作为工具、队友还是被刻意不使用，结合教师观察进行定性编码分析。

Result: 学生不仅利用AI加速原型设计和技能获取，还学会了拒绝AI输出、创建幻觉检测流程，并将节省的时间用于更深度的用户研究，将效率转化为创新。

Abstract: This pilot study traces students' reflections on the use of AI in a 13-week
foundational design course enrolling over 500 first-year engineering and
architecture students at the Singapore University of Technology and Design. The
course was an AI-enhanced design course, with several interventions to equip
students with AI based design skills. Students were required to reflect on
whether the technology was used as a tool (instrumental assistant), a teammate
(collaborative partner), or neither (deliberate non-use). By foregrounding this
three-way lens, students learned to use AI for innovation rather than just
automation and to reflect on agency, ethics, and context rather than on prompt
crafting alone. Evidence stems from coursework artefacts: thirteen structured
reflection spreadsheets and eight illustrated briefs submitted, combined with
notes of teachers and researchers. Qualitative coding of these materials
reveals shared practices brought about through the inclusion of Gen-AI,
including accelerated prototyping, rapid skill acquisition, iterative prompt
refinement, purposeful "switch-offs" during user research, and emergent
routines for recognizing hallucinations. Unexpectedly, students not only
harnessed Gen-AI for speed but (enabled by the tool-teammate-neither triage)
also learned to reject its outputs, invent their own hallucination fire-drills,
and divert the reclaimed hours into deeper user research, thereby transforming
efficiency into innovation. The implications of the approach we explore shows
that: we can transform AI uptake into an assessable design habit; that
rewarding selective non-use cultivates hallucination-aware workflows; and,
practically, that a coordinated bundle of tool access, reflection, role
tagging, and public recognition through competition awards allows AI based
innovation in education to scale without compromising accountability.

Motivation: 研究动机是探索当学习者被邀请共同设计他们使用的技术时，学生能动性如何被激活，以及从AI工具使用者到设计者的转变如何重塑学生与技术、知识的关系。

Method: 采用两学期课程设计，学生先使用教师创建的GPT支持质性研究任务，然后重新设计这些工具创建自定义应用；通过学生幻灯片展示和焦点小组访谈进行质性主题分析。

Result: 研究发现学生在角色和心态上发生显著转变：通过选择工具功能、设计和目的感到更自主，通过获取提示工程和迭代测试等AI技能感到更有能力，通过团队协作和共同目标感与同伴联系更紧密。

Conclusion: 从AI工具使用者到设计者的转变将学生从知识消费者重新配置为共同创造者，在演变的教育格局中激活了学生的能动性，重塑了与技术、知识的关系。

Abstract: This study explores how graduate students in an urban planning program
transitioned from passive users of generative AI to active creators of custom
GPT-based knowledge tools. Drawing on Self-Determination Theory (SDT), which
emphasizes the psychological needs of autonomy, competence, and relatedness as
foundations for intrinsic motivation, the research investigates how the act of
designing AI tools influences students' learning experiences, identity
formation, and engagement with knowledge. The study is situated within a
two-term curriculum, where students first used instructor-created GPTs to
support qualitative research tasks and later redesigned these tools to create
their own custom applications, including the Interview Companion GPT. Using
qualitative thematic analysis of student slide presentations and focus group
interviews, the findings highlight a marked transformation in students' roles
and mindsets. Students reported feeling more autonomous as they chose the
functionality, design, and purpose of their tools, more competent through the
acquisition of AI-related skills such as prompt engineering and iterative
testing, and more connected to peers through team collaboration and a shared
sense of purpose. The study contributes to a growing body of evidence that
student agency can be powerfully activated when learners are invited to
co-design the very technologies they use. The shift from AI tool users to AI
tool designers reconfigures students' relationships with technology and
knowledge, transforming them from consumers into co-creators in an evolving
educational landscape.

Motivation: 研究AI快速扩散背景下，文化背景如何塑造采用模式及其对人类日常生活的后果，填补文化因素在AI采用研究中的空白。

Method: 基于跨文化心理学、数字伦理和社会技术系统理论，使用来自欧洲、非洲、亚洲和南美洲9个国家21名参与者的调查数据，分析人口统计学变量（年龄、性别、职业角色）和文化取向（语言、价值观、制度接触）如何中介对AI的信任、伦理可接受性和依赖感知。

Result: 发现两个关键结果：1）文化因素特别是语言和年龄显著影响AI采用和可靠性认知，年长参与者报告更多将AI用于教育目的；2）对AI使用的伦理判断因领域而异，专业环境将其视为实用合作者而学术环境强调抄袭风险。

Conclusion: AI使用既非普遍也非中立，而是文化依赖、领域特定和伦理情境的，研究对教育、专业实践和全球技术政策中的AI使用具有启示意义，指向实现文化适应和伦理稳健的AI使用方式。

Abstract: The swift diffusion of artificial intelligence (AI) raises critical questions
about how cultural contexts shape adoption patterns and their consequences for
human daily life. This study investigates the cultural dimensions of AI
adoption and their influence on cognitive strategies across nine national
contexts in Europe, Africa, Asia, and South America. Drawing on survey data
from a diverse pilot sample (n = 21) and guided by cross-cultural psychology,
digital ethics, and sociotechnical systems theory, we examine how demographic
variables (age, gender, professional role) and cultural orientations (language,
values, and institutional exposure) mediate perceptions of trust, ethical
acceptability, and reliance on AI. Results reveal two key findings: First,
cultural factors, particularly language and age, significantly affect AI
adoption and perceptions of reliability with older participants reporting
higher engagement with AI for educational purposes. Second, ethical judgment
about AI use varied across domains, with professional contexts normalizing its
role as a pragmatic collaborator while academic settings emphasized risks of
plagiarism. These findings extend prior research on culture and technology
adoption by demonstrating that AI use is neither universal nor neutral but
culturally contingent, domain-specific, and ethically situated. The study
highlights implications for AI use in education, professional practice, and
global technology policy, pointing at actions that enable usage of AI in a way
that is both culturally adaptive and ethically robust.

Method: 通过对13名荷兰媒体编辑、记者和创新经理的访谈，分析记者如何主动管理AI技术的整合过程。

Result: 提出了"受控变革"概念，发现记者通过三种主要机制管理AI整合：制定符合伦理的适应性指南、实验性测试AI工具、批判性评估AI系统的能力与局限。

Conclusion: 记者正在以受监督的方式预期和整合AI技术，通过主动管理来维护其专业权威，确保AI工具的使用符合新闻伦理标准。

Abstract: Using (generative) artificial intelligence tools and systems in journalism is
expected to increase journalists' production rates, transform newsrooms'
economic models, and further personalize the audience's news consumption
practices. Since its release in 2022, OpenAI's ChatGPT and other large language
models have raised the alarms inside news organizations, not only for bringing
new challenges to news reporting and fact-checking but also for what these
technologies would mean for journalists' professional authority in journalism.
This paper examines how journalists in Dutch media manage the integration of AI
technologies into their daily routines. Drawing from 13 interviews with
editors, journalists, and innovation managers in different news outlets and
media companies, we propose the concept of controlled change. as a heuristic to
explain how journalists are proactively setting guidelines, experimenting with
AI tools, and identifying their limitations and capabilities. Using
professional authority as a theoretical framework, we argue that journalists
anticipate and integrate AI technologies in a supervised manner and identify
three primary mechanisms through which journalists manage this integration: (1)
developing adaptive guidelines that align AI use with ethical codes, (2)
experimenting with AI technologies to determine their necessity and fit, and
(3) critically assessing the capabilities and limitations of AI systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨数字移民在跨文化平台环境中如何适应算法治理，以及不同影响力用户如何发展不同的沟通策略。

Method: 采用多方法框架，分析时间发布模式、影响力动态、主题偏好和情感加权话题表达，将用户分为高影响力和低影响力群体进行比较分析。

Result: 发现主导话题相对稳定，但高影响力用户更倾向于文化共鸣或商业策略内容；政治话语被选择性激活作为跨国参与点；高影响力用户在文化连接话题中表达更积极情感。

Conclusion: 跨文化平台迁移不仅受结构条件影响，还取决于用户适应、表现和保持可见度的不同能力，对平台社会、情感公众和跨国数字环境中的用户能动性研究有贡献。

Abstract: In January 2025, the U.S. government enacted a nationwide ban on TikTok,
prompting a wave of American users -- self-identified as ``TikTok Refugees'' --
to migrate to alternative platforms, particularly the Chinese social media app
RedNote (Xiaohongshu). This paper examines how these digital migrants navigate
cross-cultural platform environments and develop adaptive communicative
strategies under algorithmic governance. Drawing on a multi-method framework,
the study analyzes temporal posting patterns, influence dynamics, thematic
preferences, and sentiment-weighted topic expressions across three distinct
migration phases: Pre-Ban, Refugee Surge, and Stabilization.
  An entropy-weighted influence score was used to classify users into high- and
low-influence groups, enabling comparative analysis of content strategies.
Findings reveal that while dominant topics remained relatively stable over time
(e.g., self-expression, lifestyle, and creativity), high-influence users were
more likely to engage in culturally resonant or commercially strategic content.
Additionally, political discourse was not avoided, but selectively activated as
a point of transnational engagement.
  Emotionally, high-influence users tended to express more positive affect in
culturally connective topics, while low-influence users showed stronger
emotional intensity in personal narratives. These findings suggest that
cross-cultural platform migration is shaped not only by structural affordances
but also by users' differential capacities to adapt, perform, and maintain
visibility. The study contributes to literature on platform society, affective
publics, and user agency in transnational digital environments.

Abstract: Since the COVID-19 pandemic, online grocery shopping has rapidly reshaped
consumer behavior worldwide, fueled by ever-faster delivery promises aimed at
maximizing convenience. Yet, this growth has also substantially increased urban
traffic congestion, emissions, and pollution. Despite extensive research on
urban delivery optimization, little is known about the trade-off between
individual convenience and these societal costs. In this study, we investigate
the value of marginal extensions in delivery times, termed customer patience,
in mitigating the traffic burden caused by grocery deliveries. We first
conceptualize the problem and present a mathematical model that highlights a
convex relationship between patience and traffic congestion. The theoretical
predictions are confirmed by an extensive, network-science based analysis
leveraging two large-scale datasets encompassing over 8 million grocery orders
in Dubai. Our findings reveal that allowing just five additional minutes in
delivery time reduces daily delivery mileage by approximately 30 percent and
life-cycle CO2 emissions by 20 percent. Beyond ten minutes of added patience,
however, marginal benefits diminish significantly. These results highlight that
modest increases in consumer patience can deliver substantial gains in traffic
reduction and sustainability, offering a scalable strategy to balance
individual convenience with societal welfare in urban delivery systems.

### [43] [UniqueRank: Identifying Important and Difficult-to-Replace Nodes in Attributed Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19113)
*Erica Cai,Benjamin A. Miller,Olga Simek,Christopher L. Smith*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: 提出了UniqueRank方法，结合结构重要性和属性独特性来识别网络中难以被替代的关键节点


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有节点排序方法只考虑结构重要性，忽略了节点被移除后可能被邻近节点替代的情况，无法识别真正难以替代的关键节点

Method: 基于马尔可夫链的方法，同时捕获结构重要性和属性独特性，使排名靠前的节点更难被替代

Result: 在简单对称网络中识别出与邻居属性不同的重要节点；在真实网络中移除UniqueRank排名靠前的节点会导致更大的效率降低；在生物分子结构中识别出具有独特化学环境的关键原子

Conclusion: UniqueRank方法能够有效识别网络中难以替代的关键节点，在恐怖网络、社交网络、供应链网络和生物分子结构等多种应用中表现出优越性

Abstract: Node-ranking methods that focus on structural importance are widely used in a
variety of applications, from ranking webpages in search engines to identifying
key molecules in biomolecular networks. In real social, supply chain, and
terrorist networks, one definition of importance considers the impact on
information flow or network productivity when a given node is removed. In
practice, however, a nearby node may be able to replace another node upon
removal, allowing the network to continue functioning as before. This
replaceability is an aspect that existing ranking methods do not consider. To
address this, we introduce UniqueRank, a Markov-Chain-based approach that
captures attribute uniqueness in addition to structural importance, making
top-ranked nodes harder to replace. We find that UniqueRank identifies
important nodes with dissimilar attributes from its neighbors in simple
symmetric networks with known ground truth. Further, on real terrorist, social,
and supply chain networks, we demonstrate that removing and attempting to
replace top UniqueRank nodes often yields larger efficiency reductions than
removing and attempting to replace top nodes ranked by competing methods.
Finally, we show UniqueRank's versatility by demonstrating its potential to
identify structurally critical atoms with unique chemical environments in
biomolecular structures.

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: 通过固定单个高连接度源节点的状态来打破全局对称性，可显著提高Belief Propagation算法在稀疏网络中的推理精度，无需额外计算成本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Belief Propagation算法在稀疏网络中常产生不准确的序参数估计，特别是在环较少的网络中，需要改进其推理精度

Method: 在渗流和Ising模型中，固定单个高连接度源节点的状态来打破全局对称性

Result: 该方法显著提高了推理精度，能捕捉广泛的有限尺寸效应，尤其在树状网络中效果明显

Conclusion: 通过简单的对称性打破策略，可以低成本地显著改善BP算法在稀疏网络中的性能

Abstract: Belief Propagation (BP) is an efficient message-passing algorithm widely used
for inference in graphical models and for solving various problems in
statistical physics. However, BP often yields inaccurate estimates of order
parameters and their susceptibilities in finite systems, particularly in sparse
networks with few loops. Here, we show for both percolation and Ising models
that fixing the state of a single well-connected "source" node to break global
symmetry substantially improves inference accuracy and captures finite-size
effects across a broad range of networks, especially tree-like ones, at no
additional computational cost.

Abstract: As a key to accessing research impact, citation dynamics underpins research
evaluation, scholarly recommendation, and the study of knowledge diffusion.
Citation prediction is particularly critical for newborn papers, where early
assessment must be performed without citation signals and under highly
long-tailed distributions. We identify two key research gaps: (i) insufficient
modeling of implicit factors of scientific impact, leading to reliance on
coarse proxies; and (ii) a lack of bias-aware learning that can deliver stable
predictions on lowly cited papers. We address these gaps by proposing a
Bias-Aware Citation Prediction Framework, which combines multi-agent feature
extraction with robust graph representation learning. First, a multi-agent x
graph co-learning module derives fine-grained, interpretable signals, such as
reproducibility, collaboration network, and text quality, from metadata and
external resources, and fuses them with heterogeneous-network embeddings to
provide rich supervision even in the absence of early citation signals. Second,
we incorporate a set of robust mechanisms: a two-stage forward process that
routes explicit factors through an intermediate exposure estimate, GroupDRO to
optimize worst-case group risk across environments, and a regularization head
that performs what-if analyses on controllable factors under monotonicity and
smoothness constraints. Comprehensive experiments on two real-world datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model. Specifically, our model
achieves around a 13% reduction in error metrics (MALE and RMSLE) and a notable
5.5% improvement in the ranking metric (NDCG) over the baseline methods.

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: 该论文系统性地审计了作者归属技术在性别、母语和年龄方面的偏见，发现在封闭世界设置中不存在偏见，但在真实作者被排除时，模型倾向于将文本错误地归属于与真实作者相同人口特征的用户。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 作者归属技术被广泛应用于在线环境，但其在不同人口群体间的公平性未知。偏见可能导致对特定群体的错误指控、账号封禁和隐私侵犯。

Method: 通过三种方式评估公平性：1) 评估不同人口特征比例对分类器性能的影响；2) 评估人口特征是否影响文本被误分类的概率；3) 评估当真实作者被排除时发生的错误类型。

Result: 在封闭世界设置中未发现人口偏见，但当真实作者被排除时，模型倾向于将文本错误地归属于与真实作者相同人口特征的用户，且这些错误不仅包括偏离用户通常风格的文本，也包括非常接近作者平均风格的文本。

Conclusion: 尽管在封闭世界设置中模型可能看起来公平，但这并不能保证在错误不可避免时的公平性，需要更全面的公平性评估。

Abstract: Authorship attribution techniques are increasingly being used in online
contexts such as sock puppet detection, malicious account linking, and
cross-platform account linking. Yet, it is unknown whether these models perform
equitably across different demographic groups. Bias in such techniques could
lead to false accusations, account banning, and privacy violations
disproportionately impacting users from certain demographics. In this paper, we
systematically audit authorship attribution for bias with respect to gender,
native language, and age. We evaluate fairness in 3 ways. First, we evaluate
how the proportion of users with a certain demographic characteristic impacts
the overall classifier performance. Second, we evaluate if a user's demographic
characteristics influence the probability that their texts are misclassified.
Our analysis indicates that authorship attribution does not demonstrate bias
across demographic groups in the closed-world setting. Third, we evaluate the
types of errors that occur when the true author is removed from the suspect
set, thereby forcing the classifier to choose an incorrect author. Unlike the
first two settings, this analysis demonstrates a tendency to attribute
authorship to users who share the same demographic characteristic as the true
author. Crucially, these errors do not only include texts that deviate from a
user's usual style, but also those that are very close to the author's average.
Our results highlight that though a model may appear fair in the closed-world
setting for a performant classifier, this does not guarantee fairness when
errors are inevitable.

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: 本研究分析了上海网约车与公共交通的关系，发现互补性出行（9.22%）和替代性出行（9.06%）比例相当，与传统认知不同。通过CatBoost和SHAP方法揭示了影响因素的非线性效应，特别是与地铁站距离呈现倒U型关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着网约车市场扩张和成熟，其与公共交通的互补和替代关系可能发生变化。本研究旨在探索这种转变是否正在发生，特别是在上海这样网约车市场趋于饱和的城市。

Method: 收集上海96,716辆网约车2022年9月的出行数据，提出增强的数据驱动框架将网约车-公共交通关系分为四类：首公里互补、末公里互补、替代和独立。采用CatBoost和SHAP机器学习方法分析影响因素的非线性效应。

Result: 发现互补性出行（9.22%）和替代性出行（9.06%）比例相当，与传统研究结果形成鲜明对比。影响因素如与最近地铁站距离、公交站点密度等呈现显著非线性效应。与单线地铁站距离呈现倒U型关系，在1.5公里内急剧上升，1.5-3公里保持峰值，15公里后下降。

Conclusion: 网约车与公共交通的关系正在从传统认知的替代为主转变为互补与替代并存的复杂模式。地铁枢纽和普通单线站点对首末公里互补比例有不同影响，距离效应呈现非线性特征。

Abstract: The literature on transportation network companies (TNCs), also known as
ride-hailing services, has often characterized these service providers as
predominantly substitutive to public transit (PT). However, as TNC markets
expand and mature, the complementary and substitutive relationships with PT may
shift. To explore whether such a transformation is occurring, this study
collected travel data from 96,716 ride-hailing vehicles during September 2022
in Shanghai, a city characterized by an increasingly saturated TNC market. An
enhanced data-driven framework is proposed to classify TNC-PT relationships
into four types: first-mile complementary, last-mile complementary,
substitutive, and independent. Our findings indicate comparable ratios of
complementary trips (9.22%) and substitutive trips (9.06%), contrasting sharply
with the findings of prior studies. Furthermore, to examine the nonlinear
impact of various influential factors on these ratios, a machine learning
method integrating categorical boosting (CatBoost) and Shapley additive
explanations (SHAP) is proposed. The results show significant nonlinear effects
in some variables, including the distance to the nearest metro station and the
density of bus stops. Moreover, metro hubs and regular single-line stations
exhibit distinct effects on first- or last-mile complementary ratios. These
ratios' relation to the distance to single-line stations shows an inverted
U-shaped pattern, with effects rising sharply within 1.5 km, remaining at the
peak between 1.5 and 3 km, and then declining as the distance increases to
about 15 km.

Motivation: 细胞和基因治疗试验通常样本量小、疗效极高，当出现缺失数据时监管机构要求处理策略，但针对二元终点的多重插补方法文献缺乏。

Method: 比较并开发了三种新的多重插补方法来处理二元终点的缺失数据，关注成功率的总体比例参数。

Result: 提出的方法表现良好，产生了良好的95%覆盖率。

Conclusion: 这些方法成功应用于美国国立卫生研究院进行的临床胰岛移植研究，证明了其在实际临床研究中的有效性。

Abstract: There has been an increasing interest in using cell and gene therapy (CGT) to
treat/cure difficult diseases. The hallmark of CGT trials are the small sample
size and extremely high efficacy. Due to the innovation and novelty of such
therapies, when there is missing data, more scrutiny is exercised, and
regulators often request for missing data handling strategy when missing data
occurs. Often, multiple imputation (MI) will be used. MI for continuous
endpoint is well established but literature of MI for binary endpoint is
lacking. In this work, we compare and develop 3 new methods to handle missing
data using MI for binary endpoints when the sample size is small and efficacy
extremely high. The parameter of interest is population proportion of success.
We show that our proposed methods performed well and produced good 95%
coverage. We also applied our methods to an actual clinical study, the Clinical
Islet Transplantation (CIT) Protocol 07, conducted by National Institutes of
Health (NIH).

Motivation: 目标试验模拟在非随机研究中应用日益广泛，但在模拟整群随机试验方面的应用有限。当整群随机化不可行时，需要找到合适的方法来设计非随机研究。

Method: 使用基线普查数据模拟比较四种统计方法：beta回归、准二项回归、逆概率处理加权和朴素Wald检验，评估其I类错误率和统计功效。

Result: 只有逆概率处理加权和beta回归能将I类错误率控制在0.05，但逆概率处理加权的统计功效较差。beta回归显示出足够的统计功效，被选为主要分析方法。

Conclusion: 在目标试验模拟中采用模拟引导的设计原则，可以稳健地规划模拟整群随机试验的组级非随机研究。该研究的经验也适用于个体随机试验的目标试验模拟规划。

Abstract: While target trial emulation (TTE) is increasingly used to improve the
analysis of non-randomized studies by applying trial design principles, TTE
applications to emulate cluster randomized trials (RCTs) have been limited. We
performed simulations to prospectively plan data collection of a non-randomized
study intended to emulate a village-level cluster RCT when
cluster-randomization was infeasible. The planned study will assess the impact
of mass distribution of nutritional supplements embedded within an existing
immunization program to improve pentavalent vaccination rates among children
12-24 months old in Niger. The design included covariate-constrained random
selection of villages for outcome ascertainment at follow-up. Simulations used
baseline census data on pentavalent vaccination rates and cluster-level
covariates to compare the type I error rate and power of four statistical
methods: beta-regression; quasi-binomial regression; inverse probability of
treatment weighting (IPTW); and na\"ive Wald test. Of these methods, only IPTW
and beta-regression controlled the type I error rate at 0.05, but IPTW yielded
poor statistical power. Beta-regression, which showed adequate statistical
power, was chosen as our primary analysis. Adopting simulation-guided design
principles within TTE can enable robust planning of a group-level
non-randomized study emulating a cluster RCT. Lessons from this study also
apply to TTE planning of individually-RCTs.

Motivation: 作为中国应对气候风险的核心政策工具，绿色金融在塑造碳减排成果方面具有战略重要性，需要研究其非线性影响和交互效应。

Method: 采用贝叶斯加性回归树(BART)捕捉复杂非线性关系和交互路径，使用SHAP值增强模型可解释性，并将气候物理风险指数纳入分析框架。

Result: 绿色金融指数对碳排放强度有显著倒U型效应，存在区域异质性；气候物理风险指数对碳排放无显著影响；在高能耗情景下，更强的绿色金融发展有助于降低碳排放强度。

Conclusion: 绿色金融是降低碳强度的有效工具，尤其是在能源密集型环境中，设计和实施绿色金融政策时需要考虑非线性效应和区域差异。

Abstract: As a core policy tool for China in addressing climate risks, green finance
plays a strategically important role in shaping carbon mitigation outcomes.
This study investigates the nonlinear and interaction effects of green finance
on carbon emission intensity (CEI) using Chinese provincial panel data from
2000 to 2022. The Climate Physical Risk Index (CPRI) is incorporated into the
analytical framework to assess its potential role in shaping carbon outcomes.
We employ Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) to capture complex
nonlinear relationships and interaction pathways, and use SHapley Additive
exPlanations values to enhance model interpretability. Results show that the
Green Finance Index (GFI) has a statistically significant inverted U-shaped
effect on CEI, with notable regional heterogeneity. Contrary to expectations,
CPRI does not show a significant impact on carbon emissions. Further analysis
reveals that in high energy consumption scenarios, stronger green finance
development contributes to lower CEI. These findings highlight the potential of
green finance as an effective instrument for carbon intensity reduction,
especially in energy-intensive contexts, and underscore the importance of
accounting for nonlinear effects and regional disparities when designing and
implementing green financial policies.

Motivation: 传统离散博弈假设玩家完全了解自身收益，忽略了信息获取可能是战略性选择。本文放松这一假设，考虑信息获取成本对博弈结果的影响。

Method: 构建一个统一框架，玩家面对自身收益不确定性，同时优化信息精度和行动选择。模型参数可点识别，通过蒙特卡洛实验验证识别结果。

Result: 在美国航空业进入博弈的实证应用中，发现低成本航空公司获取较少精确信息且信息成本较低，这与其注重成本效率的商业模式一致。

Conclusion: 企业信息策略的差异可以解释市场进入行为和竞争中的异质性，信息获取成本是理解企业战略决策的重要因素。

Abstract: This paper develops a novel econometric framework for static discrete choice
games with costly information acquisition. In traditional discrete games,
players are assumed to perfectly know their own payoffs when making decisions,
ignoring that information acquisition can be a strategic choice. In the
proposed framework, I relax this assumption by allowing players to face
uncertainty about their own payoffs and to optimally choose both the precision
of information and their actions, balancing the expected payoffs from precise
information against the information cost. The model provides a unified
structure to analyze how information and strategic interactions jointly
determine equilibrium outcomes. The model primitives are point identified, and
the identification results are illustrated through Monte Carlo experiments. The
empirical application of the U.S airline entry game shows that the low-cost
carriers acquire less precise information about profits and incur lower
information costs than other airlines, which is consistent with their business
model that focuses on cost efficiency. The analysis highlights how differences
in firms' information strategies can explain observed heterogeneity in market
entry behavior and competition.

absorbing treatment. The third example has a discrete multivalued treatment
that can increase or decrease multiple times over time. The fourth example has
two, binary and absorbing treatments, where the second treatment always happens
after the first.

Conclusion: COVID-19后的监管改革有效降低了欧洲银行系统的网络互联性和系统性脆弱性。

Abstract: This paper develops a continuous functional framework for analyzing contagion
dynamics in financial networks, extending the Navier-Stokes-based approach to
network-structured spatial processes. We model financial distress propagation
as a diffusion process on weighted networks, deriving a network diffusion
equation from first principles that predicts contagion decay depends on the
network's algebraic connectivity through the relation $\kappa =
\sqrt{\lambda_2/D}$, where $\lambda_2$ is the second-smallest eigenvalue of the
graph Laplacian and $D$ is the diffusion coefficient. Applying this framework
to European banking data from the EBA stress tests (2018, 2021, 2023), we
estimate interbank exposure networks using maximum entropy methods and track
the evolution of systemic risk through the COVID-19 crisis. Our key finding is
that network connectivity declined by 45\% from 2018 to 2023, implying a 26\%
reduction in the contagion decay parameter. Difference-in-differences analysis
reveals this structural change was driven by regulatory-induced deleveraging of
systemically important banks, which experienced differential asset reductions
of 17\% relative to smaller institutions. The networks exhibit lognormal rather
than scale-free degree distributions, suggesting greater resilience than
previously assumed in the literature. Extensive robustness checks across
parametric and non-parametric estimation methods confirm declining systemic
risk, with cross-method correlations exceeding 0.95. These findings demonstrate
that post-COVID-19 regulatory reforms effectively reduced network
interconnectedness and systemic vulnerability in the European banking system.

Motivation: 研究动机是为波动率管理提供微观基础，解释为什么风险厌恶投资者在波动状态下减少敞口是最优策略，并合理化逆方差启发式方法。

Method: 提出了一种分布式的行动者-评论者算法，学习针对特定风险的时间一致策略，不受效用函数形式限制，并将分位数值映射到可解释的倾斜。

Result: 实证选择的投资组合表现与投资者目标一致，证明该方法能够有效实现投资者的特定风险偏好。

Conclusion: 该研究为理解投资者基于分位数的决策行为提供了理论框架，并为波动率管理策略提供了微观经济基础，提出的算法能够有效学习符合投资者风险偏好的投资策略。

Abstract: We study the dynamic investment decisions of investors who prioritise
specific quantiles of outcomes over their expected values. Downside-focused
agents targeting low quantiles reduce risk in states with high variance, while
those with a preference for high quantiles concentrate in sleeves with high
dispersion when there is potential for upside. These results provide a
microfoundation for volatility management, demonstrating that reducing exposure
in volatile states is an optimal response for risk-averse investors and
rationalising inverse-variance heuristics. We propose a distributional
actor-critic algorithm that learns time-consistent policies tailored to these
specific risks, irrespective of the utilitys functional form. The quantile
value can be mapped onto interpretable tilts, and the performance of
empirically chosen portfolios aligns with investors objectives.

Method: 通过估计规模和风格beta系数、识别断点、分析投资风格、评估风险转移强度，比较风格转变前后的绩效指标。

Result: 基金在不同风格间转换，反映轮动、漂移或强化趋势；许多中盘混合基金保持原类别，部分转向大盘混合或中盘价值，显示价值导向策略或大盘股敞口；部分基金采用小盘价值和小盘混合等高收益风格。

Conclusion: 风格调整能基于市场条件提升收益，该研究强调了风格转换对共同基金收益的重要影响。

Abstract: Investment style groups investment approaches to predict portfolio return
variations. This study examines the relationship between investment style,
style consistency, and risk-adjusted returns of Indian equity mutual funds. The
methodology involves estimating size and style beta coefficients, identifying
breakpoints, analysing investment styles, and assessing risk-shifting
intensity. Funds transition across styles over time, reflecting rotation,
drift, or strengthening trends. Many Mid Blend funds remain in the same
category, while others shift to Large Blend or Mid Value, indicating
value-oriented strategies or large-cap exposure. Some funds adopt high-return
styles like Small Value and Small Blend, aiming for alpha through small-cap
equities. Performance changes following risk structure shifts are analyzed by
comparing pre- and post-shift metrics, showing that style adjustments can
enhance returns based on market conditions. This study contributes to mutual
fund evaluation literature by highlighting the impact of style transitions on
returns.

Motivation: 研究开发性金融机构在撒哈拉以南非洲如何降低投资风险、促进经济多元化，填补该地区实证研究的空白。

Method: 基于安哥拉的定性案例研究，通过对国际发展顾问、外交专业人士和公共部门高级利益相关者的访谈收集数据。

Result: DFIs能够降低投资风险、增强项目可信度、促进非采掘部门多元化，但其效果受到制度弱化和与国家优先事项不匹配的限制。

Conclusion: DFIs在脆弱环境中发挥关键推动作用，但长期成功需要配套的国内改革、治理改善和战略协调。

Abstract: This study investigates how Development Finance Institutions (DFIs)
contribute to de-risking development in Sub-Saharan Africa by shaping Foreign
Direct Investment (FDI) flows and supporting sustainable economic
transformation. Focusing on Angola as a representative case, the research draws
on qualitative interviews with international development advisors, foreign
affairs professionals, and senior public sector stakeholders. The study
explores how DFIs mitigate investment risk, enhance project credibility, and
promote diversification beyond extractive sectors. While DFIs are widely
recognized as catalysts for private sector engagement, particularly in
infrastructure, agriculture, and manufacturing, their effectiveness is often
constrained by institutional weaknesses and misalignment with national
development priorities. The findings suggest that DFIs play a crucial enabling
role in fragile and resource-dependent settings, but their long-term impact
depends on complementary domestic reforms, improved governance, and strategic
coordination. This research contributes to the literature on development
finance by offering grounded empirical insights from an under examined
Sub-Saharan context.

### [57] [Government Transparency Affects Innovation: Evidence from Wireless Products](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19377)
*Šimon Trlifaj*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: 政府透明度对创新的影响研究：政府无线产品数据库的推出使新技术使用量在十年内翻倍，促进了后续创新，但效果随时间减弱，且对外国竞争者的促进作用大于美国本土企业。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨政府信息透明度是否以及如何影响私营部门的创新活动，特别是通过公开技术信息数据库的方式。

Method: 评估美国政府推出的包含347,000种无线产品详细技术信息的数据库的发布效果，分析其对后续十年技术创新的影响。

Result: 数据库发布使新技术使用量约翻倍，影响范围包括同类产品和全新产品类别，但效果随时间递减，且对外国竞争者的促进作用更显著。

Conclusion: 信息对私营部门创新至关重要，政府透明度能够显著促进创新，但需要考虑其对竞争格局的影响和效果的可持续性。

Abstract: Does government transparency affect innovation? I evaluate the launch of a
government database with detailed technical information on the universe of
wireless-enabled products on the U.S. market (N 347 thousand). The results show
the launch approximately doubled the use of new technologies in the following
ten years, an indicator of follow-on innovation. The increase affected both
products in the same and new product classes, suggesting novelty; waned over
several years, potentially due to an increase in secrecy and patenting; and
boosted foreign more than U.S. domestic competitors. These results highlight
the importance of information for private sector innovation.

### [58] [Test-time Verification via Optimal Transport: Coverage, ROC, & Sub-optimality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18982)
*Arpan Mukherjee,Marcello Bullo,Debabrota Basu,Deniz Gündüz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个统一框架，将可验证的测试时缩放建模为传输问题，揭示了生成器覆盖率、验证器收敛区域和采样算法次优性之间的几何交互关系，并识别了三个不同的机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管测试时缩放与验证在提升大语言模型性能方面显示出潜力，但验证器的作用及其缺陷仍未得到充分探索。现有研究只捕捉了这些因素的部分子集，缺乏一个量化它们交互几何特性的统一框架。

Method: 将可验证的测试时缩放框架化为传输问题，分析覆盖率、收敛区域和次优性之间的相互作用。提出并分析了两类采样算法——顺序和批量采样，并研究了它们的计算复杂度如何影响这些权衡。

Result: 理论分析表明次优性-覆盖率曲线呈现三个机制：传输机制（次优性随覆盖率增加）、策略改进机制（次优性可能随覆盖率减少，取决于验证器的收敛区域）和饱和机制（次优性趋于平稳）。在Qwen、Llama和Gemma模型上的实证结果验证了理论发现。

Conclusion: 通过将可验证的测试时缩放建模为传输问题，该研究提供了一个统一框架来理解生成器覆盖率、验证器收敛区域和采样算法次优性之间的复杂交互关系，为优化大语言模型的测试时缩放策略提供了理论基础。

Abstract: While test-time scaling with verification has shown promise in improving the
performance of large language models (LLMs), the role of the verifier and its
imperfections remain underexplored. The effect of verification manifests
through interactions of three quantities: (i) the generator's coverage, (ii)
the verifier's region of convergence (ROC), and (iii) the sampling algorithm's
sub-optimality. Though recent studies capture subsets of these factors, a
unified framework quantifying the geometry of their interplay is missing. We
frame verifiable test-time scaling as a transport problem. This characterizes
the interaction of coverage, ROC, and sub-optimality, and uncovers that the
sub-optimality--coverage curve exhibits three regimes. A transport regime --
where sub-optimality increases with coverage, a policy improvement regime --
where sub-optimality may decrease with coverage, depending on the verifier's
ROC, and a saturation regime -- where sub-optimality plateaus, unaffected by
coverage. We further propose and analyze two classes of sampling algorithms --
sequential and batched, and examine how their computational complexities shape
these trade-offs. Empirical results with Qwen, Llama, and Gemma models
corroborate our theoretical findings.

*Silas Ruhrberg Estévez,Nicolás Astorga,Mihaela van der Schaar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ACTMED是一个结合贝叶斯实验设计和大型语言模型的临床诊断框架，通过逐步选择能最大程度减少诊断不确定性的测试来优化诊断流程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习诊断方法依赖静态数据集，无法模拟临床医生在实践中的顺序性、资源感知推理过程。诊断在高压或资源有限环境中仍然复杂且容易出错。

Method: 整合贝叶斯实验设计与大型语言模型，LLMs作为灵活模拟器生成患者状态分布并支持信念更新，无需结构化任务特定训练数据。临床医生可参与审查测试建议和中间输出。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上评估显示，ACTMED能优化测试选择，提高诊断准确性、可解释性和资源利用效率。

Conclusion: 该框架向透明、自适应且与临床医生对齐的诊断系统迈进一步，能在减少对领域特定数据依赖的情况下跨环境泛化。

Abstract: There is growing interest in using machine learning (ML) to support clinical
diag- nosis, but most approaches rely on static, fully observed datasets and
fail to reflect the sequential, resource-aware reasoning clinicians use in
practice. Diagnosis remains complex and error prone, especially in
high-pressure or resource-limited settings, underscoring the need for
frameworks that help clinicians make timely and cost-effective decisions. We
propose ACTMED (Adaptive Clinical Test selection via Model-based Experimental
Design), a diagnostic framework that integrates Bayesian Experimental Design
(BED) with large language models (LLMs) to better emulate real-world diagnostic
reasoning. At each step, ACTMED selects the test expected to yield the greatest
reduction in diagnostic uncertainty for a given patient. LLMs act as flexible
simulators, generating plausible patient state distributions and supporting
belief updates without requiring structured, task-specific training data.
Clinicians can remain in the loop; reviewing test suggestions, interpreting
intermediate outputs, and applying clinical judgment throughout. We evaluate
ACTMED on real-world datasets and show it can optimize test selection to
improve diagnostic accuracy, interpretability, and resource use. This
represents a step to- ward transparent, adaptive, and clinician-aligned
diagnostic systems that generalize across settings with reduced reliance on
domain-specific data.

### [60] [Rectifying Shortcut Behaviors in Preference-based Reward Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19050)
*Wenqian Ye,Guangtao Zheng,Aidong Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出PRISM方法，通过学习群不变核来缓解基于偏好的奖励模型中的捷径行为问题，提高奖励模型的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于人类反馈的强化学习中，偏好奖励模型容易出现过优化和奖励破解问题，模型会利用训练数据中的虚假特征（如回答冗长、讨好语气等）而非真正目标来获取高奖励分数。

Method: 受核视角不变性理论启发，提出PRISM方法，通过闭式学习目标学习具有特征映射的群不变核，缓解捷径行为。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，该方法一致提高了奖励模型在多样化分布外任务上的准确性，并减少了下游策略模型对捷径的依赖。

Conclusion: PRISM为基于偏好的对齐建立了一个稳健框架，有效缓解了奖励模型中的捷径行为问题。

Abstract: In reinforcement learning from human feedback, preference-based reward models
play a central role in aligning large language models to human-aligned
behavior. However, recent studies show that these models are prone to reward
hacking and often fail to generalize well due to over-optimization. They
achieve high reward scores by exploiting shortcuts, that is, exploiting
spurious features (e.g., response verbosity, agreeable tone, or sycophancy)
that correlate with human preference labels in the training data rather than
genuinely reflecting the intended objectives. In this paper, instead of probing
these issues one at a time, we take a broader view of the reward hacking
problem as shortcut behaviors and introduce a principled yet flexible approach
to mitigate shortcut behaviors in preference-based reward learning. Inspired by
the invariant theory in the kernel perspective, we propose Preference-based
Reward Invariance for Shortcut Mitigation (PRISM), which learns group-invariant
kernels with feature maps in a closed-form learning objective. Experimental
results in several benchmarks show that our method consistently improves the
accuracy of the reward model on diverse out-of-distribution tasks and reduces
the dependency on shortcuts in downstream policy models, establishing a robust
framework for preference-based alignment.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了MUSE基准测试来评估多模态大语言模型的音乐理解能力，发现现有模型在关系推理方面存在根本性弱点，与人类专家存在显著差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在音频理解方面的评估可能掩盖了其在关系推理方面的根本弱点，需要更全面的评估工具。

Method: 开发了MUSE基准测试，包含10个任务来探测基础音乐感知技能，评估了4个SOTA模型并与200人的人类基线进行比较。

Result: 发现SOTA模型能力差异很大，与人类专家存在持续差距。Gemini Pro在基础感知上表现良好，但Qwen和Audio Flamingo 3表现接近随机水平，显示出严重的感知缺陷。思维链提示效果不一致且通常有害。

Conclusion: MUSE基准为评估不变音乐表征提供了关键工具，将推动开发更稳健的AI系统。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated capabilities in
audio understanding, but current evaluations may obscure fundamental weaknesses
in relational reasoning. We introduce the Music Understanding and Structural
Evaluation (MUSE) Benchmark, an open-source resource with 10 tasks designed to
probe fundamental music perception skills. We evaluate four SOTA models (Gemini
Pro and Flash, Qwen2.5-Omni, and Audio-Flamingo 3) against a large human
baseline (N=200). Our results reveal a wide variance in SOTA capabilities and a
persistent gap with human experts. While Gemini Pro succeeds on basic
perception, Qwen and Audio Flamingo 3 perform at or near chance, exposing
severe perceptual deficits. Furthermore, we find Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
prompting provides inconsistent, often detrimental results. Our work provides a
critical tool for evaluating invariant musical representations and driving
development of more robust AI systems.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了大型语言模型在按照CONSORT标准评估临床试验报告方面的能力，发现不同模型和提示条件在推理风格、不确定性表达和解释模式上存在显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在医疗领域快速扩展，但其按照CONSORT标准评估临床试验报告的能力尚不明确，特别是在认知和推理策略方面。

Method: 采用行为和元认知分析方法，使用专家验证数据，系统比较了两个代表性LLM在三种提示条件下的表现。

Result: 模型在不同CONSORT项目和提示类型上表现出明显差异，包括推理风格的转变、明确的不确定性表达和替代解释模式。

Conclusion: 结果突出了这些系统在临床合规自动化方面的当前局限性，强调了理解其认知适应和策略行为对于开发更可解释和可靠的医疗AI的重要性。

Abstract: Despite the rapid expansion of Large Language Models (LLMs) in healthcare,
the ability of these systems to assess clinical trial reporting according to
CONSORT standards remains unclear, particularly with respect to their cognitive
and reasoning strategies. This study applies a behavioral and metacognitive
analytic approach with expert-validated data, systematically comparing two
representative LLMs under three prompt conditions. Clear differences emerged in
how the models approached various CONSORT items, and prompt types, including
shifts in reasoning style, explicit uncertainty, and alternative
interpretations shaped response patterns. Our results highlight the current
limitations of these systems in clinical compliance automation and underscore
the importance of understanding their cognitive adaptations and strategic
behavior in developing more explainable and reliable medical AI.

*Yuqiao Tan,Shizhu He,Kang Liu,Jun Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文研究了推理模型中的模式选择问题，将其识别为早期退出问题的更具挑战性变体，旨在通过零步思维决策来减少计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推理模型在数学和逻辑推理任务中表现出色，但逐步推理过程常导致过度思考，产生不必要的计算开销。为了解决这个问题，需要开发能够自动选择长链思维或短链思维模式的方法。

Method: 将模式选择识别为早期退出问题的变体，比较了九种基线方法，包括基于提示的方法和利用模型内部信息的方法，重点关注在推理过程开始时基于预定义虚假思维进行决策的零步思维方法。

Result: 基于提示的方法由于分类能力有限且依赖少量手工制作信息而经常失败；利用内部信息的方法在大多数场景中表现更好，但仍存在稳定性问题。现有方法仅依赖模型提供的信息不足以有效解决信息有限场景下的模式选择问题。

Conclusion: 模式选择是一个具有挑战性的任务，现有方法在信息有限的情况下效果有限，突显了该任务的持续挑战性。

Abstract: Reasoning models have demonstrated exceptional performance in tasks such as
mathematics and logical reasoning, primarily due to their ability to engage in
step-by-step thinking during the reasoning process. However, this often leads
to overthinking, resulting in unnecessary computational overhead. To address
this issue, Mode Selection aims to automatically decide between Long-CoT
(Chain-of-Thought) or Short-CoT by utilizing either a Thinking or NoThinking
mode. Simultaneously, Early Exit determines the optimal stopping point during
the iterative reasoning process. Both methods seek to reduce the computational
burden. In this paper, we first identify Mode Selection as a more challenging
variant of the Early Exit problem, as they share similar objectives but differ
in decision timing. While Early Exit focuses on determining the best stopping
point for concise reasoning at inference time, Mode Selection must make this
decision at the beginning of the reasoning process, relying on pre-defined fake
thoughts without engaging in an explicit reasoning process, referred to as
zero-step thinking. Through empirical studies on nine baselines, we observe
that prompt-based approaches often fail due to their limited classification
capabilities when provided with minimal hand-crafted information. In contrast,
approaches that leverage internal information generally perform better across
most scenarios but still exhibit issues with stability. Our findings indicate
that existing methods relying solely on the information provided by models are
insufficient for effectively addressing Mode Selection in scenarios with
limited information, highlighting the ongoing challenges of this task. Our code
is available at https://github.com/Trae1ounG/Zero_Step_Thinking.

TL;DR: WebGraphEval是一个将多个智能体的网络交互轨迹抽象为统一加权动作图的评估框架，能够捕捉基准数据集中的结构多样性，超越传统的二元成功指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前网络智能体评估主要依赖二元成功指标或单一参考轨迹，忽略了基准数据集中的结构多样性，需要更全面的评估方法。

Method: 将多个智能体的轨迹抽象为统一的加权动作图，对动作进行规范编码，合并重复行为，并应用奖励传播和成功加权边统计等结构分析。

Result: 在来自六个网络智能体的数千条轨迹上的评估显示，该图抽象能捕捉跨模型规律性，突出冗余和低效行为，识别被结果指标忽略的关键决策点。

Conclusion: 通过将网络交互构建为图结构数据，WebGraphEval为网络智能体建立了多路径、跨智能体和效率感知的通用评估方法。

Abstract: Current evaluation of web agents largely reduces to binary success metrics or
conformity to a single reference trajectory, ignoring the structural diversity
present in benchmark datasets. We present WebGraphEval, a framework that
abstracts trajectories from multiple agents into a unified, weighted action
graph. This representation is directly compatible with benchmarks such as
WebArena, leveraging leaderboard runs and newly collected trajectories without
modifying environments. The framework canonically encodes actions, merges
recurring behaviors, and applies structural analyses including reward
propagation and success-weighted edge statistics. Evaluations across thousands
of trajectories from six web agents show that the graph abstraction captures
cross-model regularities, highlights redundancy and inefficiency, and
identifies critical decision points overlooked by outcome-based metrics. By
framing web interaction as graph-structured data, WebGraphEval establishes a
general methodology for multi-path, cross-agent, and efficiency-aware
evaluation of web agents.

TL;DR: LLM多智能体模拟框架研究复杂社交动态，通过行为奖励函数和情境学习，使AI智能体能够再现人类在线社交行为模式，形成类似真实社交网络的结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大语言模型智能体是否能重现人类在线社交的复杂动态，包括同质性、互惠性和社会验证等特征，以及什么记忆和学习机制能促成这种动态的出现。

Method: 提出多智能体LLM模拟框架，智能体通过重复互动、相互评估和行为适应，结合行为奖励函数（涵盖社交互动、信息寻求、自我呈现、协调和情感支持）和教练信号加速的情境学习。

Result: 实验显示，经过教练的LLM智能体发展出稳定的互动模式并形成涌现的社交联系，产生的网络结构反映了真实在线社区的特性。

Conclusion: 该框架为研究LLM群体中的集体动态建立了原则性测试平台，揭示了人工智能智能体如何近似或偏离类人社交行为。

Abstract: Can large language model (LLM) agents reproduce the complex social dynamics
that characterize human online behavior -- shaped by homophily, reciprocity,
and social validation -- and what memory and learning mechanisms enable such
dynamics to emerge? We present a multi-agent LLM simulation framework in which
agents repeatedly interact, evaluate one another, and adapt their behavior
through in-context learning accelerated by a coaching signal. To model human
social behavior, we design behavioral reward functions that capture core
drivers of online engagement, including social interaction, information
seeking, self-presentation, coordination, and emotional support. These rewards
align agent objectives with empirically observed user motivations, enabling the
study of how network structures and group formations emerge from individual
decision-making. Our experiments show that coached LLM agents develop stable
interaction patterns and form emergent social ties, yielding network structures
that mirror properties of real online communities. By combining behavioral
rewards with in-context adaptation, our framework establishes a principled
testbed for investigating collective dynamics in LLM populations and reveals
how artificial agents may approximate or diverge from human-like social
behavior.

TL;DR: 本研究评估了ChatGPT在法律领域的表现，发现即使具备相关知识，它也无法整合这些知识进行推理以得出全面结果，揭示了其重大局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在评估ChatGPT在法律领域的实际表现，特别是与正则表达式基线相比，而非仅与人类表现对比，以揭示AI在法律推理中的真实能力。

Method: 通过实验比较ChatGPT与正则表达式（Regex）在法律决策分析任务中的表现，重点关注从法律判决中提取法律原则关键段落的能力。

Result: 研究发现ChatGPT即使拥有必要的知识和能力，也无法有效整合和推理这些知识来产生全面结果，显示出在法律领域的重大局限性。

Conclusion: 真正的智能需要分解复杂问题并整合多种能力提供统一解决方案，而AI在法律领域缺乏这种全面理解和推理能力，真正的智能仍然是人类独有的特质。

Abstract: This study examines the performance of ChatGPT with an experiment in the
legal domain. We compare the outcome with it a baseline using regular
expressions (Regex), rather than focusing solely on the assessment against
human performance. The study reveals that even if ChatGPT has access to the
necessary knowledge and competencies, it is unable to assemble them, reason
through, in a way that leads to an exhaustive result. This unveils a major
limitation of ChatGPT. Intelligence encompasses the ability to break down
complex issues and address them according to multiple required competencies,
providing a unified and comprehensive solution. In the legal domain, one of the
most crucial tasks is reading legal decisions and extracting key passages
condensed from principles of law (PoLs), which are then incorporated into
subsequent rulings by judges or defense documents by lawyers. In performing
this task, artificial intelligence lacks an all-encompassing understanding and
reasoning, which makes it inherently limited. Genuine intelligence, remains a
uniquely human trait, at least in this particular field.

Motivation: 传统先例推理假设先例集必须一致，而广义理由模型放松了这一假设。目前已有基于传统一致理由模型的论证解释方法，但缺乏针对容纳不一致先例的广义推理框架的相应论证解释方法。

Method: 扩展推导状态论证框架(DSA-framework)，以解释基于广义理由模型的推理过程。

Result: 开发了能够解释广义理由模型推理的论证框架扩展。

Conclusion: 成功将DSA框架扩展到广义理由模型，填补了不一致先例推理中论证解释方法的空白。

Abstract: Precedential constraint is one foundation of case-based reasoning in AI and
Law. It generally assumes that the underlying set of precedents must be
consistent. To relax this assumption, a generalized notion of the reason model
has been introduced. While several argumentative explanation approaches exist
for reasoning with precedents based on the traditional consistent reason model,
there has been no corresponding argumentative explanation method developed for
this generalized reasoning framework accommodating inconsistent precedents. To
address this question, this paper examines an extension of the derivation state
argumentation framework (DSA-framework) to explain the reasoning according to
the generalized notion of the reason model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实环境通常是非平稳的，需要智能体持续适应新任务和变化条件。现有的持续强化学习方法存在灾难性遗忘和知识利用效率低的问题。

Method: 提出持续知识适应策略，维护任务特定知识向量池，动态使用历史知识来适应新任务。同时提出自适应知识合并机制，合并相似知识向量以解决可扩展性挑战。

Result: 在三个基准测试中，CKA-RL优于最先进方法，整体性能提升4.20%，前向迁移提升8.02%。

Conclusion: CKA-RL通过持续知识适应有效缓解了灾难性遗忘，实现了跨任务的高效知识迁移，同时通过知识合并机制降低了内存需求。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning enables agents to learn optimal behaviors through
interactions with environments. However, real-world environments are typically
non-stationary, requiring agents to continuously adapt to new tasks and
changing conditions. Although Continual Reinforcement Learning facilitates
learning across multiple tasks, existing methods often suffer from catastrophic
forgetting and inefficient knowledge utilization. To address these challenges,
we propose Continual Knowledge Adaptation for Reinforcement Learning (CKA-RL),
which enables the accumulation and effective utilization of historical
knowledge. Specifically, we introduce a Continual Knowledge Adaptation
strategy, which involves maintaining a task-specific knowledge vector pool and
dynamically using historical knowledge to adapt the agent to new tasks. This
process mitigates catastrophic forgetting and enables efficient knowledge
transfer across tasks by preserving and adapting critical model parameters.
Additionally, we propose an Adaptive Knowledge Merging mechanism that combines
similar knowledge vectors to address scalability challenges, reducing memory
requirements while ensuring the retention of essential knowledge. Experiments
on three benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed CKA-RL outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, achieving an improvement of 4.20% in overall
performance and 8.02% in forward transfer. The source code is available at

TL;DR: MSC-Bench是一个大规模基准测试，用于评估LLM代理在分层MCP生态系统中的多跳端到端工具编排能力，通过五级课程系统测试代理从单工具编排到复杂跨服务器规划的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试通常在孤立环境中评估工具，忽略了功能重叠和跨服务器编排等挑战，导致评估过于乐观。MSC-Bench旨在填补这些空白。

Method: 构建基于'等函数集'的真实基准，使用客观指标如F1分数，减少对LLM作为评判的依赖，采用五级课程系统组织测试。

Result: 实验表明，刚性层次结构在没有协同设计策略时会阻碍性能，即使最先进的代理在鲁棒性方面也存在系统性弱点。

Conclusion: MSC-Bench提供了一个诊断框架来暴露这些限制，并指导开发更强大、更高效的工具使用代理。

Abstract: We introduce MSC-Bench, a large-scale benchmark for evaluating multi-hop,
end-to-end tool orchestration by LLM agents in a hierarchical Model-Context
Protocol (MCP) ecosystem. Existing benchmarks often evaluate tools in
isolation, ignoring challenges such as functional overlap and cross-server
orchestration, leading to overly optimistic assessments. MSC-Bench addresses
these gaps by constructing ground truth through 'equal function sets', allowing
objective metrics such as F1 score and reducing the dependency on
LLM-as-a-judge evaluation. Organized as a five-level curriculum, it
systematically tests agent capabilities from single-tool orchestration to
complex cross-server planning, and robustness to out-of-scope requests.
Experiments reveal that rigid hierarchies can hinder performance without
co-designed strategies, and even state-of-the-art agents exhibit systemic
weaknesses in robustness. MSC-Bench provides a diagnostic framework to expose
these limitations and guide the development of more capable and efficient
tool-using agents. The benchmark and resources are publicly available at

TL;DR: NeSyPr是一个神经符号程序化框架，通过将符号规划转化为可组合的程序表示，使语言模型能够在资源受限的动态环境中进行高效推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在动态环境中使用语言模型进行具身任务时，由于延迟、连接性和资源限制而无法在线访问大规模推理引擎或符号规划器的问题。

Method: 首先使用符号工具生成任务特定规划，然后将这些规划转化为编码隐式产生规则的可组合程序表示，最终将这些程序无缝集成到语言模型的推理过程中。

Result: 在PDDLGym、VirtualHome和ALFWorld等具身基准测试中，NeSyPr展示了比大规模推理模型和符号规划器更高效的推理能力，同时使用更紧凑的语言模型。

Conclusion: 神经符号程序化能够将多步符号结构化路径查找和推理抽象为单步语言模型推理，适合在延迟敏感和资源受限的物理系统中部署。

Abstract: We address the challenge of adopting language models (LMs) for embodied tasks
in dynamic environments, where online access to large-scale inference engines
or symbolic planners is constrained due to latency, connectivity, and resource
limitations. To this end, we present NeSyPr, a novel embodied reasoning
framework that compiles knowledge via neurosymbolic proceduralization, thereby
equipping LM-based agents with structured, adaptive, and timely reasoning
capabilities. In NeSyPr, task-specific plans are first explicitly generated by
a symbolic tool leveraging its declarative knowledge. These plans are then
transformed into composable procedural representations that encode the plans'
implicit production rules, enabling the resulting composed procedures to be
seamlessly integrated into the LM's inference process. This neurosymbolic
proceduralization abstracts and generalizes multi-step symbolic structured
path-finding and reasoning into single-step LM inference, akin to human
knowledge compilation. It supports efficient test-time inference without
relying on external symbolic guidance, making it well suited for deployment in
latency-sensitive and resource-constrained physical systems. We evaluate NeSyPr
on the embodied benchmarks PDDLGym, VirtualHome, and ALFWorld, demonstrating
its efficient reasoning capabilities over large-scale reasoning models and a
symbolic planner, while using more compact LMs.

TL;DR: 提出DAIL方法解决语言指令模糊性问题，通过分布策略和语义对齐提升智能代理对自然语言指令的理解和执行能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言指令的灵活性导致任务模糊性，严重影响算法性能，需要解决语言条件任务中的指令歧义问题

Method: DAIL方法包含两个关键组件：分布策略（通过价值分布估计机制增强任务可区分性）和语义对齐模块（捕捉轨迹与语言指令的对应关系）

Result: 在结构化和视觉观察基准测试上的广泛实验表明，DAIL有效解决了指令模糊性问题，性能优于基线方法

Conclusion: DAIL通过分布对齐学习成功解决了语言指令模糊性挑战，为智能代理理解自然语言指令提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Comprehending natural language and following human instructions are critical
capabilities for intelligent agents. However, the flexibility of linguistic
instructions induces substantial ambiguity across language-conditioned tasks,
severely degrading algorithmic performance. To address these limitations, we
present a novel method named DAIL (Distributional Aligned Learning), featuring
two key components: distributional policy and semantic alignment. Specifically,
we provide theoretical results that the value distribution estimation mechanism
enhances task differentiability. Meanwhile, the semantic alignment module
captures the correspondence between trajectories and linguistic instructions.
Extensive experimental results on both structured and visual observation
benchmarks demonstrate that DAIL effectively resolves instruction ambiguities,
achieving superior performance to baseline methods. Our implementation is
available at https://github.com/RunpengXie/Distributional-Aligned-Learning.

*Yiqian Yang,Tian Lan,Qianghuai Jia,Li Zhu,Hui Jiang,Hang Zhu,Longyue Wang,Weihua Luo,Kaifu Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HSCodeComp是首个评估深度搜索代理在分层规则应用能力的电商基准测试，要求代理根据商品描述预测10位HS编码，现有最佳代理准确率仅46.8%，远低于人类专家的95.0%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前代理基准测试忽视了深度搜索代理应用复杂规则（如法律条款、医疗手册、关税规则）的关键能力，这些规则通常具有模糊边界和隐式逻辑关系。

Method: 从大型电商平台收集真实数据构建HSCodeComp基准，包含632个产品条目，涵盖多样化产品类别，HS编码由多位人类专家标注。

Result: 在多个最先进的LLM、开源和闭源代理上的实验结果显示巨大性能差距：最佳代理仅达到46.8%的10位准确率，远低于人类专家的95.0%，测试时扩展也无法进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: 分层规则应用对深度搜索代理具有挑战性，当前代理在此类任务上表现不佳，需要开发更有效的规则理解和应用方法。

Abstract: Effective deep search agents must not only access open-domain and
domain-specific knowledge but also apply complex rules-such as legal clauses,
medical manuals and tariff rules. These rules often feature vague boundaries
and implicit logic relationships, making precise application challenging for
agents. However, this critical capability is largely overlooked by current
agent benchmarks.
  To fill this gap, we introduce HSCodeComp, the first realistic, expert-level
e-commerce benchmark designed to evaluate deep search agents in hierarchical
rule application. In this task, the deep reasoning process of agents is guided
by these rules to predict 10-digit Harmonized System Code (HSCode) of products
with noisy but realistic descriptions. These codes, established by the World
Customs Organization, are vital for global supply chain efficiency. Built from
real-world data collected from large-scale e-commerce platforms, our proposed
HSCodeComp comprises 632 product entries spanning diverse product categories,
with these HSCodes annotated by several human experts.
  Extensive experimental results on several state-of-the-art LLMs, open-source,
and closed-source agents reveal a huge performance gap: best agent achieves
only 46.8% 10-digit accuracy, far below human experts at 95.0%. Besides,
detailed analysis demonstrates the challenges of hierarchical rule application,
and test-time scaling fails to improve performance further.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AgentSense是一个基于多智能体进化系统的混合框架，将大语言模型集成到参与式城市感知中，无需训练即可适应动态城市条件和异构工作者偏好，同时提供自然语言解释增强透明度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有城市感知系统在多样化城市场景中泛化能力有限，决策过程缺乏可解释性。需要开发能够适应动态条件并提供透明解释的系统。

Method: 采用混合、免训练框架，结合经典规划器生成基线解决方案，通过多智能体进化系统迭代优化，使感知任务分配适应动态城市条件和异构工作者偏好。

Result: 在两个大规模移动数据集和七种动态干扰上的实验表明，AgentSense在适应性和可解释性方面优于传统方法，相比单智能体LLM基线在性能和鲁棒性方面表现更优。

Conclusion: AgentSense代表了向部署自适应和可解释城市感知系统的重要进展，为基于网络的城市管理提供了更可靠和透明的解决方案。

Abstract: Web-based participatory urban sensing has emerged as a vital approach for
modern urban management by leveraging mobile individuals as distributed
sensors. However, existing urban sensing systems struggle with limited
generalization across diverse urban scenarios and poor interpretability in
decision-making. In this work, we introduce AgentSense, a hybrid, training-free
framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) into participatory urban
sensing through a multi-agent evolution system. AgentSense initially employs
classical planner to generate baseline solutions and then iteratively refines
them to adapt sensing task assignments to dynamic urban conditions and
heterogeneous worker preferences, while producing natural language explanations
that enhance transparency and trust. Extensive experiments across two
large-scale mobility datasets and seven types of dynamic disturbances
demonstrate that AgentSense offers distinct advantages in adaptivity and
explainability over traditional methods. Furthermore, compared to single-agent
LLM baselines, our approach outperforms in both performance and robustness,
while delivering more reasonable and transparent explanations. These results
position AgentSense as a significant advancement towards deploying adaptive and
explainable urban sensing systems on the web.

TL;DR: 开发了一个基于图论的吉他即兴演奏建议引擎，通过构建和弦音琶音图并计算最优路径，为吉他学生提供和弦音即兴演奏建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 和弦音即兴演奏是爵士吉他理论的基础练习，但学习和实践难度较大，需要系统化的工具辅助。

Method: 首先生成和弦音琶音，构建加权图模型，计算相邻和弦节点间的最优过渡音权重，通过最短路径算法生成和弦音即兴演奏线条。

Result: 开发了一个用户友好的系统，能够处理输入输出，为吉他学生提供可实践的和弦音即兴演奏建议。

Conclusion: 该图论引擎为吉他学生提供了有效的和弦音即兴演奏练习工具，有助于掌握这一基础技能。

Abstract: We present a graph-based engine for computing chord tone soloing suggestions
for guitar students. Chord tone soloing is a fundamental practice for
improvising over a chord progression, where the instrumentalist uses only the
notes contained in the current chord. This practice is a building block for all
advanced jazz guitar theory but is difficult to learn and practice. First, we
discuss methods for generating chord-tone arpeggios. Next, we construct a
weighted graph where each node represents a chord tone arpeggio for a chord in
the progression. Then, we calculate the edge weight between each consecutive
chord's nodes in terms of optimal transition tones. We then find the shortest
path through this graph and reconstruct a chord-tone soloing line. Finally, we
discuss a user-friendly system to handle input and output to this engine for
guitar students to practice chord tone soloing.

TL;DR: 提出了一种可解释的电子竞技流式胜率预测分类解决方案，通过滑动窗口控制输入数据以反映游戏变化，准确率超过90%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子竞技观众和玩家数量增长，加上通信技术和云计算发展，推动了在线游戏行业增长。传统AI解决方案主要关注批处理分类，忽视了可视化技术。

Method: 使用滑动窗口控制输入数据的流式分类方法，包含可解释性模块，能够反映游戏中的相关变化。

Result: 实验结果显示准确率超过90%，超越了文献中的竞争解决方案。

Conclusion: 该系统可被排名和推荐系统利用，通过可解释性模块增强对预测结果的信任，支持明智决策。

Abstract: The increasing number of spectators and players in e-sports, along with the
development of optimized communication solutions and cloud computing
technology, has motivated the constant growth of the online game industry. Even
though Artificial Intelligence-based solutions for e-sports analytics are
traditionally defined as extracting meaningful patterns from related data and
visualizing them to enhance decision-making, most of the effort in professional
winning prediction has been focused on the classification aspect from a batch
perspective, also leaving aside the visualization techniques. Consequently,
this work contributes to an explainable win prediction classification solution
in streaming in which input data is controlled over several sliding windows to
reflect relevant game changes. Experimental results attained an accuracy higher
than 90 %, surpassing the performance of competing solutions in the literature.
Ultimately, our system can be leveraged by ranking and recommender systems for
informed decision-making, thanks to the explainability module, which fosters
trust in the outcome predictions.

### [76] [RLIE: Rule Generation with Logistic Regression, Iterative Refinement, and Evaluation for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19698)
*Yang Yang,Hua XU,Zhangyi Hu,Yutao Yue*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RLIE是一个将大语言模型与概率建模相结合的统一框架，用于学习加权规则集，通过四个阶段实现：规则生成、逻辑回归学习权重、迭代优化和评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM方法忽视规则间的相互作用，且未充分探索将LLM与概率规则学习结合进行鲁棒推理的机会。

Method: 四阶段框架：1) LLM生成和筛选候选规则；2) 逻辑回归学习概率权重；3) 基于预测误差迭代优化规则集；4) 评估加权规则集作为直接分类器的性能。

Result: 使用学习权重的规则直接应用性能更优，而将规则、权重和逻辑模型输出注入LLM反而降低准确性，表明LLM擅长语义生成但概率集成不可靠。

Conclusion: RLIE阐明了LLM在归纳推理中的潜力和局限性，通过与经典概率规则组合方法结合，实现更可靠的神经符号推理。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can propose rules in natural language,
sidestepping the need for a predefined predicate space in traditional rule
learning. Yet many LLM-based approaches ignore interactions among rules, and
the opportunity to couple LLMs with probabilistic rule learning for robust
inference remains underexplored. We present RLIE, a unified framework that
integrates LLMs with probabilistic modeling to learn a set of weighted rules.
RLIE has four stages: (1) Rule generation, where an LLM proposes and filters
candidates; (2) Logistic regression, which learns probabilistic weights for
global selection and calibration; (3) Iterative refinement, which updates the
rule set using prediction errors; and (4) Evaluation, which compares the
weighted rule set as a direct classifier with methods that inject rules into an
LLM. We evaluate multiple inference strategies on real-world datasets. Applying
rules directly with their learned weights yields superior performance, whereas
prompting LLMs with the rules, weights, and logistic-model outputs surprisingly
degrades accuracy. This supports the view that LLMs excel at semantic
generation and interpretation but are less reliable for precise probabilistic
integration. RLIE clarifies the potential and limitations of LLMs for inductive
reasoning and couples them with classic probabilistic rule combination methods
to enable more reliable neuro-symbolic reasoning.

*Gunshi Gupta,Karmesh Yadav,Zsolt Kira,Yarin Gal,Rahaf Aljundi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Memo是一个基于transformer的强化学习架构，通过引入记忆创建和检索机制来解决长时程任务中的上下文限制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于transformer的具身智能体在处理长时程任务时面临上下文限制，而人类能够利用压缩记忆来维持环境上下文。现有方法要么使用固定大小的循环记忆，要么依赖完整上下文，缺乏有效的记忆压缩机制。

Method: Memo在训练期间通过定期插入总结标记来创建和检索记忆，实现输入的高效压缩和抽象。

Result: 在网格世界元强化学习基准和照片级真实室内多目标导航任务中，Memo优于朴素的长上下文transformer基线，同时计算和存储效率更高。Memo在推理时对更长上下文具有更好的泛化能力，并在流式设置中保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Memo通过记忆机制有效解决了transformer在长时程具身任务中的上下文限制问题，实现了更好的性能和效率。

Abstract: To enable embodied agents to operate effectively over extended timeframes, it
is crucial to develop models that form and access memories to stay
contextualized in their environment. In the current paradigm of training
transformer-based policies for embodied sequential decision-making tasks,
visual inputs often overwhelm the context limits of transformers, while humans
can maintain and utilize a lifetime of experience compressed as memories.
Significant compression is possible in principle, as much of the input is
irrelevant and can be abstracted. However, existing approaches predominantly
focus on either recurrent models with fixed-size memory or transformers with
full-context reliance. In this work, we propose Memo, a transformer-based
architecture and training recipe for reinforcement learning (RL) on
memory-intensive, long-horizon tasks. Memo incorporates the creation and
retrieval of memory by interleaving periodic summarization tokens with the
inputs of a model during training. We demonstrate Memo's effectiveness on a
gridworld meta-RL benchmark and a multi-object navigation task in
photo-realistic indoor settings. Memo outperforms naive long-context
transformer baselines while being more compute and storage efficient.
Additionally, Memo generalizes better to longer contexts at inference time and
remains robust in streaming settings, where historical context must be
truncated to fit inference constraints.

TL;DR: 提出了PROBE基准来评估LLM智能体的主动性能力，将主动性分解为三个核心能力：搜索未指定问题、识别具体瓶颈和执行适当解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估主动性的基准局限于局部上下文，无法测试跨来源和长时间跨度的推理能力，需要更全面的评估框架。

Method: 设计PROBE基准，将主动性分解为三个核心能力管道，并应用于评估领先的LLM和流行智能体框架。

Result: 即使是先进模型也难以解决该基准，GPT-5和Claude Opus-4.1的最佳端到端性能仅为40%，揭示了当前自主行动系统的局限性。

Conclusion: 结果突显了智能体系统中自主行动的当前限制，并揭示了有前景的未来研究方向。

Abstract: LLM-based agents are increasingly moving towards proactivity: rather than
awaiting instruction, they exercise agency to anticipate user needs and solve
them autonomously. However, evaluating proactivity is challenging; current
benchmarks are constrained to localized context, limiting their ability to test
reasoning across sources and longer time horizons. To address this gap, we
present PROBE (Proactive Resolution Of BottlEnecks). PROBE decomposes
proactivity as a pipeline of three core capabilities: (1) searching for
unspecified issues, (2) identifying specific bottlenecks, and (3) executing
appropriate resolutions. We apply PROBE to evaluate leading LLMs and popular
agentic frameworks, showing that even state-of-the-art models struggle to solve
this benchmark. Computing our consistent measurements across frontier LLMs and
agents, we find that the best end-to-end performance of 40% is achieved by both
GPT-5 and Claude Opus-4.1. Additionally, we demonstrate the relative
capabilities of each model and analyze mutual failure modes. Our results
highlight the current limitations of autonomous action in agentic systems, and
expose promising future research directions.

TL;DR: WorldTest是一个评估模型学习智能体的协议，通过奖励无关的交互和在不同但相关环境中的测试阶段来评估世界模型，超越了传统的下一帧预测和奖励最大化评估方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的世界模型学习和评估方法偏离了实际目标：训练和评估都局限于下一帧预测，成功标准是在同一环境中最大化奖励。需要一种更全面的评估协议来测试模型支持多种下游任务的能力。

Method: 提出了WorldTest协议，包含奖励无关的探索、衍生测试和行为评分三个要素。具体实例化为AutumnBench，包含43个交互式网格世界环境和129个任务，涵盖掩码帧预测、规划和因果动态变化预测三个任务家族。

Result: 比较了517名人类参与者和三个前沿模型在AutumnBench上的表现，发现人类优于模型，计算规模扩展只在某些环境中提高性能而非所有环境。

Conclusion: WorldTest提供了一个新颖的模板来评估智能体对环境动态的学习情况，AutumnBench揭示了世界模型学习方面仍有显著改进空间。

Abstract: Model-learning agents should gather information to learn world models that
support many downstream tasks and inferences, such as predicting unobserved
states, estimating near- and far-term consequences of actions, planning action
sequences, and detecting changes in dynamics. Current methods for learning and
evaluating world models diverge from this goal: training and evaluation are
anchored to next-frame prediction, and success is scored by reward maximization
in the same environment. We propose WorldTest, a protocol to evaluate
model-learning agents that separates reward-free interaction from a scored test
phase in a different but related environment. WorldTest is
open-ended$\unicode{x2014}$models should support many different tasks unknown
ahead of time$\unicode{x2014}$and agnostic to model representation, allowing
comparison across approaches. We instantiated WorldTest with AutumnBench, a
suite of 43 interactive grid-world environments and 129 tasks across three
families: masked-frame prediction, planning, and predicting changes to the
causal dynamics. We compared 517 human participants and three frontier models
on AutumnBench. We found that humans outperform the models, and scaling compute
improves performance only in some environments but not others. WorldTest
provides a novel template$\unicode{x2014}$reward-free exploration, derived
tests, and behavior-based scoring$\unicode{x2014}$to evaluate what agents learn
about environment dynamics, and AutumnBench exposes significant headroom in
world-model learning.

Abstract: Machine olfaction is rapidly emerging as a transformative capability, with
applications spanning non-invasive medical diagnostics, industrial monitoring,
agriculture, and security and defense. Recent advances in stabilizing mammalian
olfactory receptors and integrating them into biophotonic and bioelectronic
systems have enabled detection at near single-molecule resolution thus placing
machines on par with trained detection dogs. As this technology converges with
multimodal AI and distributed sensor networks imbued with embedded AI, it
introduces a new, biochemical layer to a sensing ecosystem currently dominated
by machine vision and audition. This review and industry roadmap surveys the
scientific foundations, technological frontiers, and strategic applications of
machine olfaction making the case that we are currently witnessing the rise of
a new industry that brings with it a global chemosensory infrastructure. We
cover exemplary industrial, military and consumer applications and address some
of the ethical and legal concerns arising. We find that machine olfaction is
poised to bring forth a planet-wide molecular awareness tech layer with the
potential of spawning vast emerging markets in health, security, and
environmental sensing via scent.

Abstract: We present an experimental unit that realizes the ``multi-input, multi-output
manifold'' thermal management technology proposed by Lamarre & Raymond (2023).
The proposed setup can be used for experiments aimed at controlling
spatiotemporal temperature distribution. Temperature control is achieved by
impinging coolant fluid jets, leveraging a manifold of channels targeted to the
surface. The direction of the fluid is controlled by shifting the role of
channels between inputs, outputs, or closing them. Files associated with this
work include Computer-Aided Design (CAD) STEP files, Gerber files to
manufacture a Printed Circuit Board (PCB), and a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
written in Python. We provide a step-by-step guide to assemble the experimental
setup. We also provide instructions to interact with the setup through the GUI,
which allows for real-time tracking of sample temperature and flow rates per
flow control device. Additionally, we provide examples of usage of the setup,
including system characterization with step response,
Proportional-Integral-Derivative performance tracking, and disturbance
rejection in a coupled system. Extending the application is accessible through
the files provided in the open repository associated with this work. The active
cooling device presents a safe, flexible, and complete design, allowing for

Motivation: 欧洲电网拥堵日益严重，需要准确预测负荷特别是峰值负荷。非时间分辨模型具有简单紧凑的优势，其中Velander公式是传统方法。

Method: 基于极值理论建立数学模型，使用多重分位数回归和最大似然估计，通过似然比检验验证分布类型。

Result: 模型将分位数Velander公式简化为四个参数，且不牺牲预测性能，验证了峰值负荷分布属于重尾Fréchet类。

Conclusion: 提出的极值理论模型有效表征了大非居民用户的峰值负荷概率分布，简化了传统方法并保持了预测准确性。

Abstract: Electrical grid congestion is a growing challenge in Europe, driving the need
for accurate prediction of load, particularly of peak load. Non-time-resolved
models of peak load offer the advantages of simplicity and compactness, and
among them, Velander's formula (VF) is a traditional method that has been used
for decades. Moreover, VF can be adapted into a quantile VF, which learns a
truncated cumulative distribution function of peak load based on electricity
consumption. This paper proposes a mathematical model based on extreme value
theory to characterize the probability distribution of peak load for large
non-residential customers. The model underpins the quantile VF as demonstrated
through multiple quantile regression and reduces its representation to just
four parameters without sacrificing predictive performance. Moreover, using
maximum likelihood estimation and the likelihood ratio test, we validate that
the probability distribution of peak load of analysed groups belongs to the
heavy-tailed Fr\'echet class.

Abstract: This paper proposes graph analysis methods to fully automate the fault
location identification task in power distribution systems. The proposed
methods take basic unordered data from power distribution systems as input,
including branch parameters, load values, and the location of measuring
devices. The proposed data preparation and analysis methods automatically
identify the system's topology and extract essential information, such as
faulted paths, structures, loading of laterals and sublaterals, and estimate
the fault location accordingly. The proposed graph analysis methods do not
require complex node and branch numbering processes or renumbering following
changes in the system topology. The proposed methods eliminate the need for
human intervention at any step of the fault location identification process.
They are scalable and applicable to systems of any size. The performance of the
proposed algorithm is demonstrated using the IEEE 34-bus distribution test
system.

Abstract: This paper proposes a time-domain fault location identification method for
mixed overhead-underground power distribution systems that can handle
challenging fault scenarios such as sub-cycle faults, arcing faults and
evolving faults. The proposed method is formulated based on differential
equations of the system and accounts for the peculiarities of power
distribution systems with distributed generations. It considers the presence of
loads, multi-phase laterals and sub-laterals, heterogenous overhead and
underground lines, and infeeds and remote-end fault current contributions of
distributed generations. It utilizes data collected by limited number of
measuring devices installed in modern power distribution systems to
systematically eliminate possible multiple fault location estimations to
provide a single correct estimation of the actual location of the fault. The

Abstract: Ensuring the safety of vulnerable road users (VRUs), including pedestrians,
cyclists, electric scooter riders, and motorcyclists, remains a major challenge
for advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and connected and automated
vehicles (CAV) technologies. Real-world VRU tests are expensive and sometimes
cannot capture or repeat rare and hazardous events. In this paper, we present a
lightweight, configurable simulation framework that follows European New Car
Assessment Program (Euro NCAP) VRU testing protocols. A rule-based finite-state
machine (FSM) is developed as a motion planner to provide vehicle automation
during the VRU interaction. We also integrate ego-vehicle perception and
idealized Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) awareness to demonstrate safety margins
in different scenarios. This work provides an extensible platform for rapid and
repeatable VRU safety validation, paving the way for broader case-study
deployment in diverse, user-defined settings, which will be essential for
building a more VRU-friendly and sustainable intelligent transportation system.

Abstract: The paper focuses on designing a controller for unknown dynamical multi-agent
systems to achieve temporal reach-avoid-stay tasks for each agent while
preventing inter-agent collisions. The main objective is to generate a
spatiotemporal tube (STT) for each agent and thereby devise a closed-form,
approximation-free, and decentralized control strategy that ensures the system
trajectory reaches the target within a specific time while avoiding
time-varying unsafe sets and collisions with other agents. In order to achieve
this, the requirements of STTs are formulated as a robust optimization problem
(ROP) and solved using a sampling-based scenario optimization problem (SOP) to
address the issue of infeasibility caused by the infinite number of constraints
in ROP. The STTs are generated by solving the SOP, and the corresponding
closed-form control is designed to fulfill the specified task. Finally, the
effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through two case studies, one
involving omnidirectional robots and the other involving multiple drones
modelled as Euler-Lagrange systems.

TL;DR: 本研究开发了一个电动汽车车队模拟器，通过强化学习策略优化充电政策，在保持短期盈利能力的同时延长车队寿命并减轻电网压力。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电动汽车车队运营面临短期盈利、电池寿命和电网稳定性的冲突挑战。最大速率充电虽能确保车辆可用性，但会加速电池退化并增加电网压力。

Method: 开发EV车队模拟器，使用纽约出租车真实数据，比较80-20基准充电策略与强化学习策略，评估电池退化、电网压力和盈利能力。

Result: 经过5年监测，学习策略在电网压力、电池退化和盈利能力方面均优于基准策略。

Conclusion: 该模拟器帮助车队运营商评估不同充电政策的影响，为未来决策提供依据，强化学习策略能有效平衡多个目标。

Abstract: Operating fleets of electric vehicles (EVs) introduces several challenges,
some of which are borne by the fleet operator, and some of which are borne by
the power grid. To maximize short-term profit a fleet operator could always
charge EVs at the maximum rate to ensure vehicles are ready to service ride
demand. However, due to the stochastic nature of electricity demand, charging
EVs at their maximum rate may potentially increase the grid stress and lead to
overall instability. Furthermore, high-rate charging of EVs can accelerate
battery degradation, thereby reducing the service lifespan of the fleet. This
study aims to reconcile the conflicting incentives of fleet longevity,
short-term profitability, and grid stability by simulating a taxi fleet
throughout its lifespan in relation to its charging policies and service
conditions. We develop an EV fleet simulator to evaluate the battery
degradation due to unpredictable charging and ride demand. Consequently, the
impact on the power grid through the charging infrastructure is assessed due to
these activities. This simulation utilizes publicly accessible real-world
travel data from the NYC taxi dataset. We compare a baseline 80-20 fleet
charging policy with a reinforcement learning-based policy designed to prolong
the fleet's service life and alleviate grid stress. We monitor grid stress,
battery degradation, and profitability over five years and find that our
learned policy outperforms the baseline. This simulator enables fleet operators
to assess the impact of different charging policies on these indicators to make
informed decisions in the future.

Motivation: 需要协调多无人机监测未知洪水区域并估计淹没范围，传统方法对淹没区域的表征不够准确。

Method: 采用基于质心Voronoi划分的密度驱动覆盖框架，使用高斯混合密度函数建模密度函数。

Result: 在不同无人机数量（16、20、24）的ROS/Gazebo仿真中，GMDF方法始终获得更高的覆盖率。

Conclusion: GMDF方法能有效提升洪水监测效果，改善无人机空间分布。

Abstract: This study presents a control strategy for coordinating multiple unmanned
aerial vehicles (UAVs) to monitor unknown flood regions and estimate the extent
of inundation. The proposed method adopts a density-driven coverage framework
based on Centroidal Voronoi Tessellation (CVT), in which the density function
is modeled using a Gaussian Mixture of Density Functions (GMDF). This
formulation provides a more accurate characterization of inundated areas
compared to conventional axis-aligned Gaussian models. The performance of the
two density modeling approaches is systematically evaluated under different UAV
fleet sizes (16, 20, and 24), with multiple simulation trials conducted in the
ROS/Gazebo environment. The results show that the GMDF-based formulation
consistently achieves higher coverage rates, demonstrating its effectiveness in
enhancing flood monitoring and improving UAV spatial distribution.

Conclusion: 所提出的框架能够有效合成时变控制屏障函数，确保系统满足信号时序逻辑任务，且比现有方法更高效。

Abstract: This paper introduces a new framework for synthesizing time-varying control
barrier functions (TV-CBFs) for general Signal Temporal Logic (STL)
specifications using spatiotemporal tubes (STT). We first formulate the STT
synthesis as a robust optimization problem (ROP) and solve it through a
scenario optimization problem (SOP), providing formal guarantees that the
resulting tubes capture the given STL specifications. These STTs are then used
to construct TV-CBFs, ensuring that under any control law rendering them
invariant, the system satisfies the STL tasks. We demonstrate the framework
through case studies on a differential-drive mobile robot and a quadrotor, and
provide a comparative analysis showing improved efficiency over existing
approaches.

Conclusion: 所提出的降阶框架能够有效生成高精度的简化网络模型，适用于稳态分析和最优潮流研究，GPU加速显著提升了计算效率。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel structure-preserving, Kron-based reduction
framework for unbalanced distribution feeders. The method aggregates
electrically similar nodes within a mixed-integer optimization (MIP) problem to
produce reduced networks that optimally reproduce the voltage profiles of the
original full network. To overcome computational bottlenecks of MIP
formulations, we propose an exhaustive-search formulation to identify optimal
aggregation decisions while enforcing voltage margin limits. The proposed
exhaustive network reduction algorithm is parallelizable on GPUs, which enables
scalable network reduction. The resulting reduced networks approximate the full
system's voltage profiles with low errors and are suitable for steady-state
analysis and optimal power flow studies. The framework is validated on two real
utility distribution feeders with 5,991 and 8,381 nodes. The reduced models
achieve up to 90% and 80% network reduction, respectively, while the maximum
voltage-magnitude error remains below 0.003 p.u. Furthermore, on a 1000-node
version of the network, the GPU-accelerated reduction algorithm runs up to 15x
faster than its CPU-based counterpart.
