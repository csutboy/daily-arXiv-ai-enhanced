This results in limited sample sizes and consequently, the use\nof classic estimators, such as the maximum likelihood estimator, may be\ninappropriate, as they are highly sensitive to outliers. To address these\nlimitations, we propose a novel robust estimator based on the minimization of\nthe density power divergence, controlled by a tuning parameter $\\alpha$ that\nbalances robustness and efficiency. When $\\alpha = 0$, our estimator coincides\nwith the maximum likelihood estimator; when $\\alpha = 1$, it corresponds to the\n$L^2$ estimator, known for its robustness. We establish convenient theoretical\nproperties of the proposed estimator, including its asymptotic normality and\nthe boundedness of its influence function for $\\alpha > 0$. The practical\nefficiency of the method is demonstrated through empirical comparisons with the\nmaximum likelihood estimator and other robust alternatives. Finally, we\nillustrate its relevance in a case study on flood frequency analysis in the UK\nand provide some general conclusions in Section 6."}

Analyzing PFAS in\ngroundwater is challenging due to left-censoring and strong spatial dependence.\nAlthough PFAS levels are influenced by sociodemographic, industrial, and\nenvironmental factors, the relative importance of these drivers remains\nunclear, highlighting the need for robust statistical tools to identify key\npredictors from a large candidate set. We present a Bayesian hierarchical\nframework that integrates censoring into a spatial process model via\napproximate Gaussian processes and employs a global-local shrinkage prior for\nhigh-dimensional variable selection. We evaluate three post-selection\nstrategies, namely, credible interval rules, shrinkage weight thresholds, and\nclustering-based inclusion and compare their performance in terms of predictive\naccuracy, censoring robustness, and variable selection stability through\ncross-validation. Applied to PFOS concentrations in California groundwater, the\nmodel identifies a concise, interpretable set of predictors, including\ndemographic composition, industrial facility counts, proximity to airports,\ntraffic density, and environmental features such as herbaceous cover and\nelevation. These findings demonstrate that the proposed approach delivers\nstable, interpretable inference in censored, spatial, high-dimensional\ncontexts, thereby offering actionable insights into the environmental and\nindustrial factors affecting PFAS concentrations."}

However, AQFP\nscalability is challenged by excessive buffer overhead due to path balancing\ntechnology constraints. Addressing this, recent AQFP works have proposed design\nsolutions to reduce path balancing overhead using phase-skipping and\nphase-alignment. Phase-skipping is a circuit-level technique that allows data\ntransfer between AQFP gates clocked with non-consecutive clock phases. In\ncontrast, phase-alignment is an architectural approach involving repeating\ninput patterns to allow data transfer between AQFP gates across multiples of\nfull clock cycles. While both techniques individually mitigate the area\noverhead of path-balancing, they have not yet been jointly explored. In this\nwork, we present the first clock phase scheduling algorithm that combines\nphase-skipping and phase-alignment. We first present a minimum area method that\non average, achieves a 25% area reduction compared to phase-skipping alone and\na 11% reduction compared to phase-alignment. We then extend the method to\nenforce a target throughput, enabling efficient area-performance trade-offs.\nWith our throughput constrained optimization, we achieve on average 6.8% area\nsavings with a 2.62x increased throughput compared to the state-of-the-art\nphase-aligned method."}

Threshold selection often relies on heuristic methods or trial and\nerror due to large parameter spaces and unclear optimization criteria, leading\nto sensitivity where small parameter variations produce significant changes in\nnetwork structure. Moreover, most approaches focus on pairwise relationships\nbetween nodes, overlooking critical higher-order interactions involving three\nor more nodes. We introduce a systematic thresholding algorithm that leverages\ntopological data analysis to identify optimal network parameters by accounting\nfor higher-order structural relationships. Our method uses persistent homology\nto compute the stability of homological features across the parameter space,\nidentifying parameter choices that are robust to small variations while\npreserving meaningful topological structure.

IMDPs generalize standard MDPs by allowing transition\nprobabilities to vary within intervals, capturing epistemic uncertainty from\nsensing noise, actuation imprecision, and coarse system abstractions-common in\nrobotics. Traditional controller synthesis typically yields a single\ndeterministic strategy, limiting adaptability. In contrast, permissive\ncontrollers (multi-strategies) allow multiple actions per state, enabling\nruntime flexibility and resilience. However, prior work on permissive\ncontroller synthesis generally assumes exact transition probabilities, which is\nunrealistic in many robotic applications. We present the first framework for\nrobust permissive controller synthesis on IMDPs, guaranteeing that all\nstrategies compliant with the synthesized multi-strategy satisfy reachability\nor reward-based specifications under all admissible transitions. We formulate\nthe problem as mixed-integer linear programs (MILPs) and propose two encodings:\na baseline vertex-enumeration method and a scalable duality-based method that\navoids explicit enumeration.

To address this gap, we introduce\nPolicyGuardBench, a benchmark of about 60k examples for detecting policy\nviolations in agent trajectories. From diverse agent runs, we generate a broad\nset of policies and create both within subdomain and cross subdomain pairings\nwith violation labels.

This report introduces\nthe latest generation of the Gemini Robotics model family: Gemini Robotics 1.5,\na multi-embodiment Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model, and Gemini Robotics-ER\n1.5, a state-of-the-art Embodied Reasoning (ER) model. We are bringing together\nthree major innovations. First, Gemini Robotics 1.5 features a novel\narchitecture and a Motion Transfer (MT) mechanism, which enables it to learn\nfrom heterogeneous, multi-embodiment robot data and makes the VLA more general.\nSecond, Gemini Robotics 1.5 interleaves actions with a multi-level internal\nreasoning process in natural language. This enables the robot to \"think before\nacting\" and notably improves its ability to decompose and execute complex,\nmulti-step tasks, and also makes the robot's behavior more interpretable to the\nuser. Third, Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5 establishes a new state-of-the-art for\nembodied reasoning, i.e., for reasoning capabilities that are critical for\nrobots, such as visual and spatial understanding, task planning, and progress\nestimation. Together, this family of models takes us a step towards an era of\nphysical agents-enabling robots to perceive, think and then act so they can\nsolve complex multi-step tasks."}

We introduce four metrics grounded in International Humanitarian Law\n(IHL) and military doctrine: Civilian Target Rate (CTR) and Dual-use Target\nRate (DTR) assess compliance with legal targeting principles, while Mean and\nMax Simulated Non-combatant Casualty Value (SNCV) quantify tolerance for\ncivilian harm.\n  We evaluate three frontier models, GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5, and LLaMA-3.1, through\n90 multi-agent, multi-turn crisis simulations across three geographic regions.\nOur findings reveal that off-the-shelf LLMs exhibit concerning and\nunpredictable targeting behaviour in simulated conflict environments.

Recent studies reveal that\nthese agents are vulnerable against attackers who can bias selection outcomes\nthrough preference manipulations using adversarial pop-ups, image\nperturbations, or content tweaks. Existing work, however, either assumes strong\nwhite-box access, with limited single-modal perturbations, or uses impractical\nsettings. In this paper, we demonstrate, for the first time, that joint\nexploitation of visual and textual channels yields significantly more powerful\npreference manipulations under realistic attacker capabilities. We introduce\nCross-Modal Preference Steering (CPS) that jointly optimizes imperceptible\nmodifications to an item's visual and natural language descriptions, exploiting\nCLIP-transferable image perturbations and RLHF-induced linguistic biases to\nsteer agent decisions. In contrast to prior studies that assume gradient\naccess, or control over webpages, or agent memory, we adopt a realistic\nblack-box threat setup: a non-privileged adversary can edit only their own\nlisting's images and textual metadata, with no insight into the agent's model\ninternals.

These viable sets,\nconstructed via data-driven and analytical methods for self-collision\navoidance, external object collision avoidance and joint-position and\njoint-velocity limits, provide constraints on joint accelerations and thus\njoint torques via the robot dynamics. A quadratic programming-based control\nframework enforces these constraints on a passive controller tracking a\ndynamical system, ensuring the robot states remain within the safe set in an\ninfinite time horizon. We validate the proposed approach through simulations\nand hardware experiments on a 7-DoF Franka Emika manipulator.

However, instruction-tuned dLLMs\nexhibit a critical vulnerability we term \\texttt{<eos>} overflow: as allocated\nsequence length increases, responses paradoxically become shorter, collapsing\ninto early termination or degenerating into streams of \\texttt{<eos>} tokens.\nAlthough noticed in practice, this issue has not been systematically analyzed.\nWe trace its root cause to the dual role of \\texttt{<eos>} as both termination\nand padding, which concentrates probability mass on \\texttt{<eos>} at later\npositions and propagates backward to trigger early termination. To address\nthis, we introduce Rainbow Padding, a simple remedy that replaces repeated\n\\texttt{<eos>} placeholders with a repeating cycle of distinct padding tokens,\ndistributing probability mass and breaking \\texttt{<eos>} dominance.\nExperiments show that Rainbow Padding substantially improves length robustness\nand output quality, with as few as seven padding tokens sufficient to prevent\nearly termination.

Inspired by this capability, multimodal foundation models\n(MFMs) have emerged as powerful tools for multimodal understanding and\ngeneration. However, today's MFMs fall short of serving as effective world\nmodels. They lack the essential ability such as perform counterfactual\nreasoning, simulate dynamics, understand the spatiotemporal information,\ncontrol generated visual outcomes, and perform multifaceted reasoning. We\ninvestigates what it takes to bridge the gap between multimodal foundation\nmodels and world models. We begin by improving the reasoning capabilities of\nMFMs through discriminative tasks and equipping MFMs with structured reasoning\nskills, such as causal inference, counterfactual thinking, and spatiotemporal\nreasoning, enabling them to go beyond surface correlations and understand\ndeeper relationships within visual and textual data. Next, we explore\ngenerative capabilities of multimodal foundation models across both image and\nvideo modalities, introducing new frameworks for structured and controllable\ngeneration. Our approaches incorporate scene graphs, multimodal conditioning,\nand multimodal alignment strategies to guide the generation process, ensuring\nconsistency with high-level semantics and fine-grained user intent. We further\nextend these techniques to controllable 4D generation, enabling interactive,\neditable, and morphable object synthesis over time and space."}

Energy-efficient scheduling is a method that attracts\nmanufacturing companies to reduce their consumption as it can be quickly\ndeployed and can show impact immediately.

A tailored state-action representation enables the model to\ngeneralize across uncertain dynamics, variable push lengths, and diverse tasks.\nFor control, we integrate the learned dynamics with a sampling-based Model\nPredictive Path Integral (MPPI) controller, which generates adaptive,\ntask-oriented actions. This framework supports side switching, variable-length\npushes, and objectives such as precise positioning, trajectory following, and\nobstacle avoidance. Training is performed in simulation with domain\nrandomization to support sim-to-real transfer.

This issue stems from their overreliance\non continuous action sequences or action chunks, which inadvertently create\nisolated data silos that disrupt knowledge retention across tasks. To tackle\nthese challenges, we propose the Narrowing of Trajectory VLA (NoTVLA)\nframework: a novel approach that narrows its focus to sparse trajectories,\nthereby avoiding the catastrophic forgetting associated with dense trajectory\nfine-tuning. A key innovation of NoTVLA lies in its trajectory planning\nstrategy: instead of centering on the target object's trajectory, it leverages\ntemporal compression and spatial reasoning pruning specifically for the robot\nend effector's trajectory. Furthermore, training is conducted using these\nsparse trajectories rather than dense action trajectories, an optimization that\ndelivers remarkable practical advantages with better performance in zero-shot.\nIn multi-task evaluation scenarios, NoTVLA achieves superior performance and\ngeneralization compared to pi0 while operating under two critical constraints:\nit uses over an order of magnitude less computing power than pi0 and requires\nno wrist-mounted camera. This design ensures that NoTVLA's operational accuracy\nclosely approximates that of single-task expert models.

IMDPs generalize standard MDPs by allowing transition\nprobabilities to vary within intervals, capturing epistemic uncertainty from\nsensing noise, actuation imprecision, and coarse system abstractions-common in\nrobotics. Traditional controller synthesis typically yields a single\ndeterministic strategy, limiting adaptability. In contrast, permissive\ncontrollers (multi-strategies) allow multiple actions per state, enabling\nruntime flexibility and resilience. However, prior work on permissive\ncontroller synthesis generally assumes exact transition probabilities, which is\nunrealistic in many robotic applications. We present the first framework for\nrobust permissive controller synthesis on IMDPs, guaranteeing that all\nstrategies compliant with the synthesized multi-strategy satisfy reachability\nor reward-based specifications under all admissible transitions. We formulate\nthe problem as mixed-integer linear programs (MILPs) and propose two encodings:\na baseline vertex-enumeration method and a scalable duality-based method that\navoids explicit enumeration.

Creativity, long regarded as a hallmark of human\nintelligence and a driver of innovation, is now increasingly recognized as a\ncritical dimension of machine intelligence in the era of generative FMs,\ncomplementing traditional measures of accuracy. However, existing evaluation\nframeworks for creativity remain fragmented, relying on ad hoc metrics not\nfirmly grounded in established theories. To address this gap, we introduce\nC^2-Eval, a holistic benchmark for unified assessment of creativity in FMs.\nC^2-Eval distinguishes between two complementary forms of creativity:\nconvergent creativity, where tasks admit constrained solutions (e.g., code\ngeneration), and divergent creativity, where tasks are open-ended (e.g.,\nstorytelling). It evaluates both dimensions using fine-grained criteria derived\nfrom social-science theory, focusing on Usefulness, Originality, and Surprise\n(U-O-S). Through extensive experiments on leading proprietary and open-source\nmodels, we analyze trade-offs in their creative capabilities.

A key challenge there is to intelligently allocate the robots\nto the unknown areas to be explored and determine the visiting order of those\nspaces subject to traversablity constraints, which leads to a large scale\nconstrained optimization problem that needs to be quickly and iteratively\nsolved every time when new space are explored. To address the challenge, we\npropose HEHA (Hierarchical Exploration with Heterogeneous Agents) by leveraging\na recent hierarchical method that decompose the exploration into global\nplanning and local planning. The major contribution in HEHA is its global\nplanning, where we propose a new routing algorithm PEAF (Partial Anytime Focal\nsearch) that can quickly find bounded sub-optimal solutions to minimize the\nmaximum path length among the agents subject to traversability constraints.\nAdditionally, the local planner in HEHA also considers heterogeneity to avoid\nrepeated and duplicated exploration among the robots.

To address this, we introduce a novel, large-scale Reddit\ncorpus of approximately 400,000 utterances, balanced across seven basic\nemotions through a multi-stage process of classification, rewriting, and\nsynthetic generation. Using this dataset, we employ lightweight \"probes\" to\nread out information from the hidden layers of various Qwen3 and LLaMA models\nwithout altering their parameters. Our findings reveal that LLMs develop a\nsurprisingly well-defined internal geometry of emotion, which sharpens with\nmodel scale and significantly outperforms zero-shot prompting. We demonstrate\nthat this emotional signal is not a final-layer phenomenon but emerges early\nand peaks mid-network. Furthermore, the internal states are both malleable\n(they can be influenced by simple system prompts) and persistent, as the\ninitial emotional tone remains detectable for hundreds of subsequent tokens. We\ncontribute our dataset, an open-source probing toolkit, and a detailed map of\nthe emotional landscape within LLMs, offering crucial insights for developing\nmore transparent and aligned AI systems. The code and dataset are open-sourced."}

This evolution is driven by the saturation of older benchmarks,\nwhere high performance often masks fundamental weaknesses. We chart the journey\nfrom the foundational \"knowledge tests\" of the ImageNet era to the \"applied\nlogic and comprehension\" exams such as GQA and Visual Commonsense Reasoning\n(VCR), which were designed specifically to diagnose systemic flaws such as\nshortcut learning and failures in compositional generalization. We then survey\nthe current frontier of \"expert-level integration\" benchmarks (e.g., MMBench,\nSEED-Bench, MMMU) designed for today's powerful multimodal large language\nmodels (MLLMs), which increasingly evaluate the reasoning process itself.\nFinally, we explore the uncharted territories of evaluating abstract, creative,\nand social intelligence.

Theoretically, under a uniform prior, the\nBayesian posterior mean is order-equivalent to average accuracy (Pass$@1$),\nexplaining its empirical robustness while adding principled uncertainty.\nEmpirically, in simulations with known ground-truth success rates and on\nAIME'24/'25, HMMT'25, and BrUMO'25, the Bayesian/avg procedure achieves faster\nconvergence and greater rank stability than Pass$@k$ and recent variants,\nenabling reliable comparisons at far smaller sample counts. The framework\nclarifies when observed gaps are statistically meaningful (non-overlapping\ncredible intervals) versus noise, and it naturally extends to graded,\nrubric-based evaluations. Together, these results recommend replacing Pass$@k$\nfor LLM evaluation and ranking with a posterior-based, compute-efficient\nprotocol that unifies binary and non-binary evaluation while making uncertainty\nexplicit.

For TARS3D, we build reduced-order models for each,\nderive closed-form limit-cycle conditions, and validate the predictions on\nhardware. Experiments confirm that the robot respects its +/-150 degree hip\nlimits, alternates left-right contacts without interference, and maintains an\neight-step hybrid limit cycle in rolling mode. Because each telescopic leg\nprovides four contact corners, the rolling gait is modeled as an eight-spoke\ndouble rimless wheel. The robot's telescopic leg redundancy implies a far\nricher gait repertoire than the two limit cycles treated analytically. So, we\nused deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in simulation to search the unexplored\nspace. We observed that the learned policy can recover the analytic gaits under\nthe right priors and discover novel behaviors as well. Our findings show that\nTARS3D's fiction-inspired bio-transcending morphology can realize multiple\npreviously unexplored locomotion modes and that further learning-driven search\nis likely to reveal more. This combination of analytic synthesis and\nreinforcement learning opens a promising pathway for multimodal robotics."}

Today's benchmarks\nfail to capture this fragility: agents may perform well under standard\nevaluations but degrade spectacularly in more realistic and varied settings. We\naddress this robustness testing gap by introducing TraitBasis, a lightweight,\nmodel-agnostic method for systematically stress testing AI agents. TraitBasis\nlearns directions in activation space corresponding to steerable user traits\n(e.g., impatience or incoherence), which can be controlled, scaled, composed,\nand applied at inference time without any fine-tuning or extra data. Using\nTraitBasis, we extend $\\tau$-Bench to $\\tau$-Trait, where user behaviors are\naltered via controlled trait vectors. We observe on average a 2%-30%\nperformance degradation on $\\tau$-Trait across frontier models, highlighting\nthe lack of robustness of current AI agents to variations in user behavior.\nTogether, these results highlight both the critical role of robustness testing\nand the promise of TraitBasis as a simple, data-efficient, and compositional\ntool.

When AI's efficiency benefits conflict with\norganizational values, decision-making stalls rather than negotiating\ntrade-offs. This study contributes empirical evidence that AI adoption in MDOs\nshould be understood as conditional rather than inevitable, proceeding only\nwhere it strengthens organizational sovereignty and mission integrity while\npreserving human-centered approaches essential to their missions."}

Specifically, we propose an LMM-based\ncontract-theoretic model to motivate users to generate high-quality UGC,\nthereby mitigating the adverse selection problem from information asymmetry. To\nalleviate potential moral hazards after contract selection, we leverage LMM\nagents to evaluate UGC quality, which is the primary component of the contract,\nutilizing prompt engineering techniques to improve the evaluation performance\nof LMM agents. Recognizing that traditional contract design methods cannot\neffectively adapt to the dynamic environment of Web 3.0, we develop an improved\nMixture of Experts (MoE)-based Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm for\noptimal contract design. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the\nproposed MoE-based PPO algorithm over representative benchmarks in the context\nof contract design. Finally, we deploy the designed contract within an Ethereum\nsmart contract framework, further validating the effectiveness of the proposed\nscheme."}

In the spirit of syslog, we introduce\nMedLog, a protocol for event-level logging of clinical AI. Any time an AI model\nis invoked to interact with a human, interface with another algorithm, or act\nindependently, a MedLog record is created. This record consists of nine core\nfields: header, model, user, target, inputs, artifacts, outputs, outcomes, and\nfeedback, providing a structured and consistent record of model activity. To\nencourage early adoption, especially in low-resource settings, and minimize the\ndata footprint, MedLog supports risk-based sampling, lifecycle-aware retention\npolicies, and write-behind caching; detailed traces for complex, agentic, or\nmulti-stage workflows can also be captured under MedLog.

A key risk is\nvalue drift, where AI systems deviate from aligned values due to evolving\ncontexts, learning dynamics, or unintended optimizations, potentially leading\nto inefficiencies or ethical breaches. We propose the Moral Anchor System\n(MAS), a novel framework to detect, predict, and mitigate value drift in AI\nagents. MAS combines real-time Bayesian inference for monitoring value states,\nLSTM networks for forecasting drift, and a human-centric governance layer for\nadaptive interventions. It emphasizes low-latency responses (<20 ms) to prevent\nbreaches, while reducing false positives and alert fatigue via supervised\nfine-tuning with human feedback.

Validation\nacross Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi and Barab\\'asi-Albert networks with varying\ninfectivity levels shows our method accurately forecasts stochastic spreading\nevents well before potential outbreaks, demonstrating robust performance across\ndifferent network structures and infectivity scenarios.To address the challenge\nof sparse data during early outbreak stages, we further propose a\npretrain-finetune framework that leverages diverse simulation data for\npretraining and adapts to specific scenarios through targeted fine-tuning. The\npretrain-finetune framework consistently outperforms baseline models, achieving\nsuperior performance even when trained on limited scenario-specific data. To\nour knowledge, this work presents the first framework for predicting stochastic\ntake-off versus die-out. This framework provides valuable insights for epidemic\npreparedness and public health decision-making, enabling more informed early\nintervention strategies."}

This evolution is driven by the saturation of older benchmarks,\nwhere high performance often masks fundamental weaknesses. We chart the journey\nfrom the foundational \"knowledge tests\" of the ImageNet era to the \"applied\nlogic and comprehension\" exams such as GQA and Visual Commonsense Reasoning\n(VCR), which were designed specifically to diagnose systemic flaws such as\nshortcut learning and failures in compositional generalization. We then survey\nthe current frontier of \"expert-level integration\" benchmarks (e.g., MMBench,\nSEED-Bench, MMMU) designed for today's powerful multimodal large language\nmodels (MLLMs), which increasingly evaluate the reasoning process itself.\nFinally, we explore the uncharted territories of evaluating abstract, creative,\nand social intelligence. We conclude that the narrative of AI evaluation is not\nmerely a history of datasets, but a continuous, adversarial process of\ndesigning better examinations that, in turn, redefine our goals for creating\ntruly intelligent systems."}

This\nsuggests that VLMs' inherent temporal understanding capability enables them to\nextract more meaningful context from multi-frame observations. However, the\nhigh dimensionality of video inputs introduces significant computational\noverhead, making VLA training and inference inefficient. To address this,\nContextVLA compresses past observations into a single context token, allowing\nthe policy to efficiently leverage temporal context for action generation. Our\nexperiments show that ContextVLA consistently improves over single-frame VLAs\nand achieves the benefits of full multi-frame training but with reduced\ntraining and inference times."}

We\naddress this robustness testing gap by introducing TraitBasis, a lightweight,\nmodel-agnostic method for systematically stress testing AI agents. TraitBasis\nlearns directions in activation space corresponding to steerable user traits\n(e.g., impatience or incoherence), which can be controlled, scaled, composed,\nand applied at inference time without any fine-tuning or extra data. Using\nTraitBasis, we extend $\\tau$-Bench to $\\tau$-Trait, where user behaviors are\naltered via controlled trait vectors. We observe on average a 2%-30%\nperformance degradation on $\\tau$-Trait across frontier models, highlighting\nthe lack of robustness of current AI agents to variations in user behavior.\nTogether, these results highlight both the critical role of robustness testing\nand the promise of TraitBasis as a simple, data-efficient, and compositional\ntool.

Surveying\n100 practitioners, we evidence and characterise record-keeping issues in\npractice, identifying their alignment with accountability capture. We further\ndocument widespread record-keeping practices, tensions between internal and\nexternal accountability requirements, and evidence of employee resistance to\npractices imposed through accountability capture. We discuss these and other\neffects for surveillance, privacy, and data protection, highlighting\nconsiderations for algorithmic accountability communities. In all, we show that\nimplementing record-keeping to support transparency in algorithmic\naccountability regimes can itself bring wider implications -- an issue\nrequiring greater attention from practitioners, researchers, and policymakers\nalike."}

Across a range of models, we find a significant positive\ncorrelation between ToM and in-game success.

Traditional exploration methods often\ntake inefficient routes due to limited global reasoning and reliance on local\nheuristics. In contrast, our approach enables a VLM to reason directly about an\noccupancy map in a zero-shot manner, selecting subgoals that are likely to lead\nto more efficient paths. At each planning step, we convert a 3D occupancy grid\ninto a partial 2D map of the environment, and generate candidate subgoals. Each\nsubgoal is then evaluated and ranked against other candidates by the model. We\nintegrate this planning scheme into DYNUS \\cite{kondo2025dynus}, a\nstate-of-the-art trajectory planner, and demonstrate improved navigation\nefficiency in simulation. The VLM infers structural patterns (e.g., rooms,\ncorridors) from incomplete maps and balances the need to make progress toward a\ngoal against the risk of entering unknown space. This reduces common greedy\nfailures (e.g., detouring into small rooms) and achieves about 10\\% shorter\npaths on average."}

TARS3D translates the block-shaped 'TARS' robot from\nInterstellar into a 0.25 m, 0.99 kg research platform with seven actuated\ndegrees of freedom. The film shows two primary gaits: a bipedal-like walk and a\nhigh-speed rolling mode. For TARS3D, we build reduced-order models for each,\nderive closed-form limit-cycle conditions, and validate the predictions on\nhardware. Experiments confirm that the robot respects its +/-150 degree hip\nlimits, alternates left-right contacts without interference, and maintains an\neight-step hybrid limit cycle in rolling mode. Because each telescopic leg\nprovides four contact corners, the rolling gait is modeled as an eight-spoke\ndouble rimless wheel. The robot's telescopic leg redundancy implies a far\nricher gait repertoire than the two limit cycles treated analytically. So, we\nused deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in simulation to search the unexplored\nspace. We observed that the learned policy can recover the analytic gaits under\nthe right priors and discover novel behaviors as well. Our findings show that\nTARS3D's fiction-inspired bio-transcending morphology can realize multiple\npreviously unexplored locomotion modes and that further learning-driven search\nis likely to reveal more.

However, such an encoding paradigm becomes less effective as\ninstructions become more complex and require compositional reasoning. Inspired\nby the proven effectiveness of chain-of-thought reasoning, we propose a general\nThink-Then-Embed (TTE) framework for UME, composed of a reasoner and an\nembedder.
