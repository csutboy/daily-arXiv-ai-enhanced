In these studies, noncompliance\ncan occur at both the patient and cluster levels. Some studies measure\ncluster-level implementation using multiple continuous metrics while\ndocumenting individual binary compliance. The complier average causal effect\nestimates the intervention effects among individuals that comply with the\nassigned intervention. However, it does not account for compliance metrics at\nthe cluster level. When compliance with the intervention is influenced by both\nproviders and individuals, it can be scientifically beneficial to describe the\neffects of the intervention between all levels of compliance. We propose a\nBayesian method for PCRCTs with one-sided binary noncompliance at the\nindividual level and one-sided partial compliance at the cluster level. Our\nBayesian model classifies clusters into latent compliance strata based on\npretreatment characteristics, partial compliance status, and individual\noutcomes. Because compliance is only observed in the treatment arm, the method\nimputes unobserved compliance for control clusters and the individuals within\nthem. This approach estimates finite and super-population estimands within\nstrata defined by both cluster- and individual-level compliance. We apply this\nmethod to the METRIcAL trial, a multi-part, pragmatic cluster randomized trial\nevaluating the effects of a personalized music intervention on agitation in\nnursing home residents with dementia."}

This article focuses on Atlantic sea\nscallop abundance data along the northeast coast of the United States,\ncollected from two bottom trawl surveys which cover a larger spatial domain but\nhave low catch efficiency, and a dredge survey which is more efficient but\nlimited to domains where the species are believed to be present. To model such\ndata, integrated species distribution models (ISDMs) have been proposed to\nincorporate information from multiple surveys, by including common\nenvironmental effects along with correlated survey-specific spatial fields.\nHowever, while flexible, these ISDMs can be susceptible to overfitting, which\ncan complicate interpretability of the shared environmental effects and\npotentially lead to poor predictive performance. To overcome these drawbacks,\nwe introduce a novel single index ISDM, built from a single index (with spatial\nrandom effects) that represents a latent measure of the true species\ndistribution, and survey-specific catch efficiency functions which map the\nsingle index to the survey-specific expected catch. Our results show that the\nsingle index ISDM offers more meaningful interpretations of the environmental\neffects and survey catch efficiency differences, while potentially achieving\nbetter predictive performance than existing ISDMs."}

We argue that this often results from a limited\nunderstanding of the social and technical barriers, and particularly how their\ninterplay shapes transformation outcomes. To address this gap, we document\nbarriers identified in the literature and grounded in sociotechnical systems\ntheory, organized into six dimensions: people, processes, culture, goals,\ninfrastructure, and technology. We then map these barriers to the U.S.\nDepartment of Defense's DE policy goals. Our analysis shows that technological\ninvestments alone are insufficient, as failures frequently arise from social\nfactors such as workforce readiness, leadership support, and cultural\nalignment. The mapping also demonstrates that sociotechnical barriers often\ncascade across dimensions, making their impact on policy goals difficult to\ntrace and complicating implementation. These insights carry practical\nimplications: managers may use the mapping as a diagnostic tool to identify\nrisks and prioritize resources; policymakers may complement strategic mandates\nwith sustained investments and long-term change management; and engineers may\nview DE not as a threat to job security but as an opportunity for more\neffective collaboration."}

Our objective is to accurately predict the\nimpact point, defined as the object's landing position. This task poses two key\nchallenges: the absence of public datasets capturing diverse objects under\nunsteady aerodynamics, which are essential for training reliable predictors;\nand the difficulty of accurate early-stage impact point prediction when\ntrajectories appear similar across objects. To overcome these issues, we\nconstruct a real-world dataset of 8,000 trajectories from 20 objects, providing\na foundation for advancing in-flight object catching under complex\naerodynamics. We then propose the Discriminative Impact Point Predictor (DIPP),\nconsisting of two modules: (i) a Discriminative Feature Embedding (DFE) that\nseparates trajectories by dynamics to enable early-stage discrimination and\ngeneralization, and (ii) an Impact Point Predictor (IPP) that estimates the\nimpact point from these features. Two IPP variants are implemented: an Neural\nAcceleration Estimator (NAE)-based method that predicts trajectories and\nderives the impact point, and a Direct Point Estimator (DPE)-based method that\ndirectly outputs it. Experimental results show that our dataset is more diverse\nand complex than existing dataset, and that our method outperforms baselines on\nboth 15 seen and 5 unseen objects. Furthermore, we show that improved\nearly-stage prediction enhances catching success in simulation and demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of our approach through real-world experiments.

This task poses two key\nchallenges: the absence of public datasets capturing diverse objects under\nunsteady aerodynamics, which are essential for training reliable predictors;\nand the difficulty of accurate early-stage impact point prediction when\ntrajectories appear similar across objects. To overcome these issues, we\nconstruct a real-world dataset of 8,000 trajectories from 20 objects, providing\na foundation for advancing in-flight object catching under complex\naerodynamics. We then propose the Discriminative Impact Point Predictor (DIPP),\nconsisting of two modules: (i) a Discriminative Feature Embedding (DFE) that\nseparates trajectories by dynamics to enable early-stage discrimination and\ngeneralization, and (ii) an Impact Point Predictor (IPP) that estimates the\nimpact point from these features. Two IPP variants are implemented: an Neural\nAcceleration Estimator (NAE)-based method that predicts trajectories and\nderives the impact point, and a Direct Point Estimator (DPE)-based method that\ndirectly outputs it.

We expand on this by introducing a method\nto update the internal potential field model of the patient with measured\npositions and forces for more transparent model-mediated tele-ultrasound. We\nfirst generate a point cloud model of the patient's surface and transmit this\nto the sonographer in a compact data structure. This is converted to a static\nvoxelized volume where each voxel contains a potential field value. These\nvalues determine the forces and torques, which are rendered based on overlap\nbetween the voxelized volume and a point shell model of the ultrasound\ntransducer. We solve for the potential field using a convex quadratic that\ncombines the spatial Laplace operator with measured forces. This was evaluated\non volunteer patients ($n=3$) by computing the accuracy of rendered forces.\nResults showed the addition of measured forces to the model reduced the force\nmagnitude error by an average of 7.23 N and force vector angle error by an\naverage of 9.37$^{\\circ}$ compared to using only Laplace's equation."}

While game-theoretic models capture how AVs influence HVs, they often\nsuffer from a long-term decay of influence and can be perceived as\nmanipulative, eroding the human's trust. This can paradoxically lead to riskier\nhuman driving behavior over repeated interactions. In this paper, we address\nthis challenge by proposing the Trust-Aware Embodied Bayesian Persuasion\n(TA-EBP) framework. Our work makes three key contributions: First, we apply\nBayesian persuasion to model communication at traffic intersections, offering a\ntransparent alternative to traditional game-theoretic models. Second, we\nintroduce a trust parameter to the persuasion framework, deriving a theorem for\nthe minimum trust level required for influence. Finally, we ground the abstract\nsignals of Bayesian persuasion theory into a continuous, physically meaningful\naction space, deriving a second theorem for the optimal signal magnitude,\nrealized as an AV's forward nudge. Additionally, we validate our framework in a\nmixed-autonomy traffic simulation, demonstrating that TA-EBP successfully\npersuades HVs to drive more cautiously, eliminating collisions and improving\ntraffic flow compared to baselines that either ignore trust or lack\ncommunication.

Because a scheming AI would deliberately try to hide its\nmisaligned goals and actions, measuring and mitigating scheming requires\ndifferent strategies than are typically used in ML. We propose that assessing\nanti-scheming interventions requires at least (1) testing propensity to scheme\non far out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks, (2) evaluating whether lack of scheming\nis driven by situational awareness, and (3) checking for robustness to\npre-existing misaligned goals. We use a broad category of \"covert actions\" --\nsuch as secretly breaking rules or intentionally underperforming in tests -- as\na proxy for scheming, and design evaluations for covert actions. We then\nstress-test deliberative alignment as a case study for anti-scheming. Across 26\nOOD evaluations (180+ environments), deliberative alignment reduces covert\naction rates (OpenAI o3: 13%->0.4%) but does not fully eliminate them. Our\nmitigation is also able to largely stop agents from pursuing a hidden goal\npreviously trained into the model, but we still find misbehavior after\nadditional red-teaming. We find that models' chain-of-thought (CoT) often\ndemonstrates awareness of being evaluated for alignment, and show causal\nevidence that this awareness decreases covert behavior, while unawareness\nincreases it. Therefore, we cannot exclude that the observed reductions in\ncovert action rates are at least partially driven by situational awareness.\nWhile we rely on human-legible CoT for training, studying situational\nawareness, and demonstrating clear evidence of misalignment, our ability to\nrely on this degrades as models continue to depart from reasoning in standard\nEnglish.

Large\nuncertainty about EV loading increases RC activation intraday to correct for\nforecasting errors at the earlier CLC stage. For large fleet sizes (e.g.\n25.000) the optimal policy limits redispatch due to market liquidity risks in\nthe immature redispatch market.

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) enables integration\nbetween LLMs and external tools.\n  Objective: To evaluate whether an LLM connected to an EHR database via MCP\ncan autonomously retrieve clinically relevant information in a real hospital\nsetting.\n  Methods: We developed EHR-MCP, a framework of custom MCP tools integrated\nwith the hospital EHR database, and used GPT-4.1 through a LangGraph ReAct\nagent to interact with it. Six tasks were tested, derived from use cases of the\ninfection control team (ICT). Eight patients discussed at ICT conferences were\nretrospectively analyzed.

Of the miniature robots, the magnetically\nactuated ones are the most functional and dexterous. However, existing magnetic\nminiature robots are currently impractical for surgery because they are either\nrestricted to possessing at most two on-board functionalities or having limited\nfive degrees-of-freedom (DOF) locomotion.

Because a scheming AI would deliberately try to hide its\nmisaligned goals and actions, measuring and mitigating scheming requires\ndifferent strategies than are typically used in ML. We propose that assessing\nanti-scheming interventions requires at least (1) testing propensity to scheme\non far out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks, (2) evaluating whether lack of scheming\nis driven by situational awareness, and (3) checking for robustness to\npre-existing misaligned goals. We use a broad category of \"covert actions\" --\nsuch as secretly breaking rules or intentionally underperforming in tests -- as\na proxy for scheming, and design evaluations for covert actions. We then\nstress-test deliberative alignment as a case study for anti-scheming. Across 26\nOOD evaluations (180+ environments), deliberative alignment reduces covert\naction rates (OpenAI o3: 13%->0.4%) but does not fully eliminate them. Our\nmitigation is also able to largely stop agents from pursuing a hidden goal\npreviously trained into the model, but we still find misbehavior after\nadditional red-teaming. We find that models' chain-of-thought (CoT) often\ndemonstrates awareness of being evaluated for alignment, and show causal\nevidence that this awareness decreases covert behavior, while unawareness\nincreases it. Therefore, we cannot exclude that the observed reductions in\ncovert action rates are at least partially driven by situational awareness.\nWhile we rely on human-legible CoT for training, studying situational\nawareness, and demonstrating clear evidence of misalignment, our ability to\nrely on this degrades as models continue to depart from reasoning in standard\nEnglish.

To address these limitations, this paper trains a residual neural\nnetwork on a large dataset of robot-obstacle configurations to enable fast and\ntractable clearance prediction, even at unseen configurations. The predicted\nclearance defines the radius of a Local Safety Ball (LSB), which ensures\ncontinuous-time collision-free navigation. The LSB boundary is encoded as a\nDiscrete-Time High-Order CBF (DHOCBF), whose constraints are incorporated into\na nonlinear optimization framework. To improve feasibility, a novel relaxation\ntechnique is applied. The resulting framework ensure that the robot's\nrigid-body motion between consecutive time steps remains collision-free,\neffectively bridging discrete-time control and continuous-time safety. We show\nthat the proposed method handles arbitrary, including nonconvex, robot\ngeometries and generates collision-free, dynamically feasible trajectories in\ncluttered environments.
