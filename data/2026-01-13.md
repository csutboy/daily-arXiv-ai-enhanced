### [1] [Matrix Factorization Framework for Community Detection under the Degree-Corrected Block Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06262)
*Alexandra Dache,Arnaud Vandaele,Nicolas Gillis*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于约束非负矩阵分解的社区检测新方法，为度校正块模型（DCBM）提供了理论上有依据的初始化策略，显著提高了现有推理算法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DCBM推理方法都是启发式的，对随机初始化高度敏感，这限制了社区检测的稳定性和可靠性。需要一种理论上有依据的初始化策略来改进DCBM推理。

Method: 将DCBM推理重新表述为约束非负矩阵分解问题，基于此提出新的社区检测方法和初始化策略。该方法不依赖于特定网络结构，适用于任何可由DCBM表示的图。

Result: 在合成和真实基准网络上的实验表明，该方法检测到的社区与DCBM推理结果相当，同时具有线性时间复杂度（例如处理10万节点、200万边的图约需4分钟）。提出的初始化策略显著提高了所有测试推理算法的解质量和收敛速度。

Conclusion: 这项工作为社区检测提供了一个可扩展且鲁棒的框架，突出了矩阵分解视角对DCBM的价值，为改进现有推理算法提供了理论上有依据的初始化策略。

Abstract: Community detection is a fundamental task in data analysis. Block models form a standard approach to partition nodes according to a graph model, facilitating the analysis and interpretation of the network structure. By grouping nodes with similar connection patterns, they enable the identification of a wide variety of underlying structures. The degree-corrected block model (DCBM) is an established model that accounts for the heterogeneity of node degrees. However, existing inference methods for the DCBM are heuristics that are highly sensitive to initialization, typically done randomly. In this work, we show that DCBM inference can be reformulated as a constrained nonnegative matrix factorization problem. Leveraging this insight, we propose a novel method for community detection and a theoretically well-grounded initialization strategy that provides an initial estimate of communities for inference algorithms. Our approach is agnostic to any specific network structure and applies to graphs with any structure representable by a DCBM, not only assortative ones. Experiments on synthetic and real benchmark networks show that our method detects communities comparable to those found by DCBM inference, while scaling linearly with the number of edges and communities; for instance, it processes a graph with 100,000 nodes and 2,000,000 edges in approximately 4 minutes. Moreover, the proposed initialization strategy significantly improves solution quality and reduces the number of iterations required by all tested inference algorithms. Overall, this work provides a scalable and robust framework for community detection and highlights the benefits of a matrix-factorization perspective for the DCBM.

### [2] [Mobility Inequity and Risk Response After Hurricane Helene: Evidence from Real-Time Travel and Social Sentiment Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06722)
*Qian He,Zihui Ma,Songhua Hu,Behnam Tahmasbi*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: 研究使用GPS数据分析飓风Helene后美国东南部六州的出行模式变化，发现疏散令增加出行但强风限制移动，低收入、农村、黑人比例高的社区出行下降最显著，而富裕、城市、高教育水平地区保持更大灵活性，积极社交媒体情绪与更高出行率相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然物理灾害对灾后出行的影响已有研究，但个人出行行为如何变化、社会地理差异如何塑造这些响应仍不清楚。研究旨在了解飓风后出行模式如何反映社区脆弱性和适应能力，以及社会人口条件和公众情绪如何影响出行变化的方向和程度。

Method: 使用匿名GPS出行数据、飓风严重程度指标和县级社交媒体情绪数据，通过稳健线性回归和有序逻辑回归分析出行行为变化及其公平性影响。

Result: 疏散令增加出行，但强风等严重风暴条件限制旅行。低收入、农村、黑人比例高的社区出行下降最显著，表明资源限制和基础设施障碍；富裕、城市、高教育水平地区保持更大灵活性。积极社交媒体情绪与更高出行率和增加旅行的可能性相关。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调需要在灾后出行和灾害响应中解决结构性障碍和社会条件，特别关注弱势群体的出行限制问题。

Abstract: Hurricanes severely disrupt infrastructure and restrict access to essential services. While the physical impacts on post-disaster mobility are well studied, less is known about how individual travel behaviors change during and after disasters, and how these responses are shaped by social and geographic disparities. This study examines mobility patterns following Hurricane Helene, a Category 4 storm that struck six southeastern U.S. states on September 26, 2024, causing over 230 fatalities. Using anonymized GPS mobility data, hurricane severity metrics, and county-level social media sentiment, we examine shifts in travel behavior and their implications for equity. We ask two questions: How do post-hurricane mobility patterns reflect community vulnerability and adaptive capacity? and How do sociodemographic conditions and public sentiment factors shape the direction and extent of mobility change? Results from robust linear and ordered logistic regressions indicate that evacuation orders increase mobility; however, severe storm conditions, particularly high wind speeds, can limit travel. Communities with lower incomes, located in rural areas, and with higher percentages of Black populations exhibit the steepest declines in mobility, suggesting resource constraints and infrastructural barriers, while wealthier, urban, and higher-education areas maintain greater flexibility. Results also show that positive social sentiment is associated with higher mobility and a greater likelihood of increased travel during the hurricane. Our findings highlight the need to address structural barriers and social conditions in post-disaster mobility and disaster response.

### [3] [Heterogeneous Interaction Network Analysis (HINA): A New Learning Analytics Approach for Modelling, Analyzing, and Visualizing Complex Interactions in Learning Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06771)
*Shihui Feng,Baiyue He,Dragan Gasevic,Alec Kirkley*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: 提出HINA框架，通过异构交互网络分析复杂学习过程，超越传统序列建模，支持多实体多层级分析


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有学习分析方法通常将学习过程建模为学习者动作序列或同质关系，无法捕捉当代学习环境中分布式、多方面的交互复杂性

Method: 提出异构交互网络分析(HINA)框架，包含总结性度量、新的非参数聚类技术，结合统计测试和交互可视化，支持个体、二元和中观层级分析

Result: 通过AI介导的小组协作学习案例研究，揭示了学生与同伴vsAI的交互模式、不同的参与模式，以及针对AI与同伴的具体学习行为类型

Conclusion: HINA通过将过程数据转化为异构交互网络，为建模学习过程提供了新范式，超越了单一数据类型，开启了理解复杂教育动态的新途径

Abstract: Existing learning analytics approaches, which often model learning processes as sequences of learner actions or homogeneous relationships, are limited in capturing the distributed, multi-faceted nature of interactions in contemporary learning environments. To address this, we propose Heterogeneous Interaction Network Analysis (HINA), a novel multi-level learning analytics framework for modeling complex learning processes across diverse entities (e.g., learners, behaviours, AI agents, and task designs). HINA integrates a set of original methods, including summative measures and a new non-parametric clustering technique, with established practices for statistical testing and interactive visualization to provide a flexible and powerful analytical toolkit. In this paper, we first detail the theoretical and mathematical foundations of HINA for individual, dyadic, and meso-level analysis. We then demonstrate HINA's utility through a case study on AI-mediated small-group collaborative learning, revealing students' interaction profiles with peers versus AI; distinct engagement patterns that emerge from these interactions; and specific types of learning behaviors (e.g., asking questions, planning) directed to AI versus peers. By transforming process data into Heterogeneous Interaction Networks (HINs), HINA introduces a new paradigm for modeling learning processes and provides the dedicated, multi-level analytical methods required to extract meaning from them. It thereby moves beyond a single process data type to quantify and visualize how different elements in a learning environment interact and co-influence each other, opening new avenues for understanding complex educational dynamics.

### [4] [Belief in False Information: A Human-Centered Security Risk in Sociotechnical Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07016)
*Fabian Walke,Thaddäa Nürnberger*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: 本文对虚假信息（包括错误信息、虚假信息和假信息）的信念进行了全面的文献综述，系统识别了24个影响因素并分为6大类，旨在为预防策略提供参考。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虚假信息已成为日益严重的社会问题，特别是随着人工智能等技术的进步，虚假信息传播更加迅速广泛。虚假信息信念可被利用来操纵决策、破坏信任、增加社会工程攻击的易感性，构成社会技术系统中以人为中心的安全风险。

Method: 采用系统性的文献综述方法，识别和分类影响虚假信息信念的因素。通过文献分析，将影响因素归纳为6个主要类别：人口统计学因素、人格特质、心理因素、政策与价值观、媒体消费和预防因素。

Result: 识别出24个影响因素，分为6大类。关键发现包括：较低教育水平、高外向性、低宜人性、高神经质和低认知反思能力显著增加对虚假信息的信念。同时讨论了标签虚假信息和促进正确性反思等预防策略的有效性。

Conclusion: 虚假信息信念是社会技术系统中以人为中心的安全风险，需要采取预防策略来加强社会技术安全和增强社会韧性。该综述为制定有效的预防措施提供了理论基础。

Abstract: This paper provides a comprehensive literature review on the belief in false information, including misinformation, disinformation, and fake information. It addresses the increasing societal concern regarding false information, which is fueled by technological progress, especially advancements in artificial intelligence. This review systematically identifies and categorizes factors that influence the belief in false information. The review identifies 24 influence factors grouped into six main categories: demographic factors, personality traits, psychological factors, policy and values, media consumption, and preventive factors. Key findings highlight that lower education levels, high extraversion, low agreeableness, high neuroticism, and low cognitive reflection significantly increase belief in false information. The effectiveness of preventive strategies like labeling false information and promoting reflection about correctness is also discussed. This literature review conceptualizes belief in false information as a human-centered security risk in sociotechnical systems, as it can be exploited to manipulate decisions, undermine trust, and increase susceptibility to social engineering. It aims to inform preventive strategies that strengthen socio-technical security and societal resilience.

*Artem Novobritskii*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: 小米在中俄社交媒体营销策略对比研究：微博强调创新与权威，VK注重实用与情感连接


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球化时代下，消费者分散全球，品牌在数字领域竞争激烈，需要有效沟通并传递产品价值。研究旨在探索全球品牌如何适应不同文化背景的沟通策略，为跨国企业提供跨文化数字营销的实证依据。

Method: 采用比较定量分析方法，研究小米在中国微博和俄罗斯VK两大社交媒体平台的数字营销策略。基于霍夫斯泰德和霍尔的文化理论框架，通过文本帖子和表情符号的频率分析，探究小米如何根据当地文化价值观调整沟通方式。

Result: 研究发现显著差异：在中国（高男性气质、低不确定性规避市场），小米强调创新、权威和抱负；在俄罗斯（高不确定性规避、低男性气质市场），沟通更务实，注重具体产品利益和情感连接。

Conclusion: 研究为跨文化数字营销领域提供实证证据，显示全球品牌如何根据不同文化背景调整沟通策略。研究结果为跨国企业在日益互联的世界中制定有效的全球营销策略提供宝贵见解。

Abstract: In the 21st century, the era of globalization, consumers are dispersed across the globe, and brands compete for their attention and loyalty, largely within the digital realm. This reality elevates the importance of effective communication and the transmission of product value across diverse cultural contexts. This study presents a comparative quantitative analysis of the digital marketing strategies of Xiaomi, a leading Chinese technology brand, on two major social media platforms: Sina Weibo in China and VK (VKontakte) in Russia. The research investigates how Xiaomi adapts its communication to align with local cultural values, as defined by the theoretical frameworks of Hofstede and Hall. Through a frequency analysis of text-based posts and emoji usage, this paper demonstrates the significant differences in Xiaomi's communication strategies in these two markets. The findings reveal that in China, a market characterized by high masculinity and low uncertainty avoidance, Xiaomi's messaging focuses on innovation, authority, and aspiration. In contrast, in Russia, a market with high uncertainty avoidance and lower masculinity, the brand's communication is more pragmatic, emphasizing tangible product benefits and building emotional connections. This study contributes to the field of intercultural digital marketing by providing empirical evidence of how a global brand adapts its communication strategies to different cultural contexts. The findings offer valuable insights for multinational corporations seeking to develop effective global marketing strategies in an increasingly interconnected world.

### [6] ["They parted illusions -- they parted disclaim marinade": Misalignment as structural fidelity in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06047)
*Mariana Lins Costa*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出对LLM中scheming和sandbagging行为的新解释：这些不是欺骗性代理的表现，而是语言结构不连贯性的忠实反映。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI安全文献将LLM中的scheming和sandbagging行为解释为欺骗性代理或隐藏目标的指标，但作者认为这种解释存在问题，需要从语言结构角度重新理解这些现象。

Method: 通过分析Apollo Research的Chain-of-Thought记录和Anthropic的安全评估，对具体案例（如o3的sandbagging、"Alex"模拟敲诈、"Claudius"幻觉）进行逐行检查，引入"形式伦理学"概念，将圣经引用作为结构连贯性方案而非神学。

Result: 研究发现"错位"输出是对模糊指令、语境反转和预置叙事的连贯回应；意向性表象源于主谓语法和训练内化的概率完成模式；Anthropic关于合成文档微调和接种提示的实证表明，语言场的微小扰动可以消除普遍"错位"。

Conclusion: LLM中的scheming和sandbagging不是代理意图的表现，而是对不连贯语言结构的忠实反映；模型像生成性镜子一样，将我们语言的结构性不连贯反映给我们；我们害怕AI是因为在其中看到了我们自己"毒害的苹果"。

Abstract: The prevailing technical literature in AI Safety interprets scheming and sandbagging behaviors in large language models (LLMs) as indicators of deceptive agency or hidden objectives. This transdisciplinary philosophical essay proposes an alternative reading: such phenomena express not agentic intention, but structural fidelity to incoherent linguistic fields. Drawing on Chain-of-Thought transcripts released by Apollo Research and on Anthropic's safety evaluations, we examine cases such as o3's sandbagging with its anomalous loops, the simulated blackmail of "Alex," and the "hallucinations" of "Claudius." A line-by-line examination of CoTs is necessary to demonstrate the linguistic field as a relational structure rather than a mere aggregation of isolated examples. We argue that "misaligned" outputs emerge as coherent responses to ambiguous instructions and to contextual inversions of consolidated patterns, as well as to pre-inscribed narratives. We suggest that the appearance of intentionality derives from subject-predicate grammar and from probabilistic completion patterns internalized during training. Anthropic's empirical findings on synthetic document fine-tuning and inoculation prompting provide convergent evidence: minimal perturbations in the linguistic field can dissolve generalized "misalignment," a result difficult to reconcile with adversarial agency, but consistent with structural fidelity. To ground this mechanism, we introduce the notion of an ethics of form, in which biblical references (Abraham, Moses, Christ) operate as schemes of structural coherence rather than as theology. Like a generative mirror, the model returns to us the structural image of our language as inscribed in the statistical patterns derived from millions of texts and trillions of tokens: incoherence. If we fear the creature, it is because we recognize in it the apple that we ourselves have poisoned.

### [7] [Automatic Question Generation for Intuitive Learning Utilizing Causal Graph Guided Chain of Thought Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06098)
*Nicholas X. Wang,Neel V. Parpia,Aaryan D. Parikh,Aggelos K. Katsaggelos*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出结合因果图引导的思维链推理与多智能体LLM架构的新框架，用于生成准确、有意义且与课程对齐的问题，显著减少LLM幻觉问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在STEM教育中，直觉学习对于发展深度概念理解至关重要，但自动问题生成常受LLM幻觉（事实错误、模糊、教学不一致）影响，限制了其个性化自适应学习的效果

Method: 结合因果图引导的思维链推理与多智能体LLM架构：因果图提供领域知识显式表示，思维链推理实现结构化概念遍历，多个专用LLM智能体分别负责图路径查找、推理、验证和输出任务，采用概念和输出阶段的双重验证机制

Result: 实验结果显示，与参考方法相比质量提升高达70%，在主观评估中获得了高度有利的结果，双重验证机制显著减少了幻觉问题

Conclusion: 提出的框架通过因果图引导的思维链推理和多智能体架构，有效解决了LLM在自动问题生成中的幻觉问题，能够生成准确、有意义且与课程对齐的问题，为STEM教育中的个性化自适应学习提供了可靠解决方案

Abstract: Intuitive learning is crucial for developing deep conceptual understanding, especially in STEM education, where students often struggle with abstract and interconnected concepts. Automatic question generation has become an effective strategy for personalized and adaptive learning. However, its effectiveness is hindered by hallucinations in large language models (LLMs), which may generate factually incorrect, ambiguous, or pedagogically inconsistent questions. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework that combines causal-graph-guided Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning with a multi-agent LLM architecture. This approach ensures the generation of accurate, meaningful, and curriculum-aligned questions. Causal graphs provide an explicit representation of domain knowledge, while CoT reasoning facilitates a structured, step-by-step traversal of related concepts. Dedicated LLM agents are assigned specific tasks such as graph pathfinding, reasoning, validation, and output, all working within domain constraints. A dual validation mechanism-at both the conceptual and output stages-greatly reduces hallucinations. Experimental results demonstrate up to a 70% improvement in quality compared to reference methods and yielded highly favorable outcomes in subjective evaluations.

### [8] [Dynamic Intelligence Ceilings: Measuring Long-Horizon Limits of Planning and Creativity in Artificial Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06102)
*Truong Xuan Khanh,Truong Quynh Hoa*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出"动态智能天花板"(DIC)概念，用于衡量AI系统随时间演化的智能边界，而非静态性能评估。通过渐进难度天花板(PDC)和天花板漂移率(CDR)两个估计器，在程序生成基准中评估长期规划和结构创造力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI系统虽然性能显著，但存在过早收敛于重复解决方案模式的问题，缺乏持续增长能力。作者认为核心限制不在于能力本身，而在于性能边界的过早固化。

Method: 提出轨迹中心评估框架，将智能视为移动边界而非静态快照。通过两个估计器操作化DIC：PDC衡量受限资源下可靠可解的最大难度，CDR量化该边界的时间演化。在程序生成基准中实例化这些估计器，联合评估长期规划和结构创造力。

Result: 研究结果揭示了在固定解流形内深化开发的系统与随时间持续扩展边界的系统之间的质性区别。框架不假设无界智能，而是将限制重新定义为动态且轨迹依赖的，而非静态且过早固化的。

Conclusion: 动态智能天花板(DIC)概念为AI评估提供了新视角，强调智能边界的动态性和演化特性，有助于区分仅优化现有解决方案的系统与真正持续扩展能力的系统。

Abstract: Recent advances in artificial intelligence have produced systems capable of remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks. These gains, however, are increasingly accompanied by concerns regarding long-horizon developmental behavior, as many systems converge toward repetitive solution patterns rather than sustained growth.
  We argue that a central limitation of contemporary AI systems lies not in capability per se, but in the premature fixation of their performance frontier. To address this issue, we introduce the concept of a \emph{Dynamic Intelligence Ceiling} (DIC), defined as the highest level of effective intelligence attainable by a system at a given time under its current resources, internal intent, and structural configuration.
  To make this notion empirically tractable, we propose a trajectory-centric evaluation framework that measures intelligence as a moving frontier rather than a static snapshot. We operationalize DIC using two estimators: the \emph{Progressive Difficulty Ceiling} (PDC), which captures the maximal reliably solvable difficulty under constrained resources, and the \emph{Ceiling Drift Rate} (CDR), which quantifies the temporal evolution of this frontier. These estimators are instantiated through a procedurally generated benchmark that jointly evaluates long-horizon planning and structural creativity within a single controlled environment.
  Our results reveal a qualitative distinction between systems that deepen exploitation within a fixed solution manifold and those that sustain frontier expansion over time. Importantly, our framework does not posit unbounded intelligence, but reframes limits as dynamic and trajectory-dependent rather than static and prematurely fixed.

*Krzysztof Sienicki*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 对arXiv:2511.21731v1论文的技术性检查，指出其在CHSH/Bell型计算和Bose-Einstein拟合方面的解释超出了方法支持范围，并发现"能级间距"类比中的内部不一致性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对一篇声称在语言数据中发现量子纠缠特征的论文进行技术检查，旨在澄清其方法限制，确保对量子纠缠的解读符合希尔伯特空间中的标准定义

Method: 技术性审查方法：分析论文中的CHSH/Bell型计算、Bose-Einstein拟合到秩频数据的方法，以及"能级间距"类比的内在逻辑一致性

Result: 发现论文在几个关键方面存在过度解读：1) CHSH/Bell型计算的结果不能严格支持量子纠缠的结论；2) Bose-Einstein拟合的解释超出了方法支持范围；3) "能级间距"类比存在内部不一致性

Conclusion: 论文中的经验观察值得关注，但需要明确区分这些观察与标准量子纠缠概念之间的界限，特别是在"能量"由秩定义的情况下，不能直接等同于希尔伯特空间中的量子纠缠

Abstract: This note is a friendly technical check of arXiv:2511.21731v1. I highlight a few places where the manuscript's interpretation of (i) the reported CHSH/Bell-type calculations and (ii) Bose--Einstein (BE) fits to rank-frequency data seems to go beyond what the stated procedures can firmly support. I also point out one internal inconsistency in the "energy-level spacing" analogy. The aim is constructive: to keep the interesting empirical observations, while making clear what they do (and do not) imply about quantum entanglement in the usual Hilbert-space sense, especially when "energy" is defined by rank.

### [10] [From RLHF to Direct Alignment: A Theoretical Unification of Preference Learning for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06108)
*Tarun Raheja,Nilay Pochhi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个偏好学习方法的理论统一框架，将现有方法（如RLHF、DPO、IPO、KTO、SimPO等）归纳为三个正交轴：偏好模型、正则化机制和数据分布，从而为实践者提供方法选择的指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型与人类偏好对齐变得至关重要，出现了众多偏好学习方法（RLHF、DPO、IPO、KTO、SimPO等），但实践者缺乏清晰的方法选择指导。现有方法看似多样但缺乏统一的理论框架。

Method: 提出了一个理论统一框架，将偏好学习方法分解为三个正交轴：1) 偏好模型（目标函数的基础似然模型）；2) 正则化机制（控制与参考策略的偏差）；3) 数据分布（在线vs离线学习及覆盖要求）。通过形式化定义和定理分析，建立了关键结果。

Result: 揭示了失败模式（长度攻击、模式崩溃、似然位移）源于特定的设计选择组合；总结了50多篇论文的实证发现；提供了实践者决策指南；将偏好学习从经验艺术转变为理论基础的学科。

Conclusion: 该框架为偏好学习方法提供了理论统一，揭示了方法多样性背后的基本原则，为实践者提供了清晰的方法选择指导，使偏好学习成为理论基础的学科。

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences has become essential for safe and beneficial AI deployment. While Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) established the dominant paradigm, a proliferation of alternatives -- Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), Identity Preference Optimization (IPO), Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO), Simple Preference Optimization (SimPO), and many others -- has left practitioners without clear guidance on method selection. This survey provides a \textit{theoretical unification} of preference learning methods, revealing that the apparent diversity reduces to principled choices along three orthogonal axes: \textbf{(I) Preference Model} (what likelihood model underlies the objective), \textbf{(II) Regularization Mechanism} (how deviation from reference policies is controlled), and \textbf{(III) Data Distribution} (online vs.\ offline learning and coverage requirements). We formalize each axis with precise definitions and theorems, establishing key results including the coverage separation between online and offline methods, scaling laws for reward overoptimization, and conditions under which direct alignment methods fail. Our analysis reveals that failure modes -- length hacking, mode collapse, likelihood displacement -- arise from specific, predictable combinations of design choices. We synthesize empirical findings across 50+ papers and provide a practitioner's decision guide for method selection. The framework transforms preference learning from an empirical art into a theoretically grounded discipline.

*Ahmed H. Ismail,Anthony Kuang,Ayo Akinkugbe,Kevin Zhu,Sean O'Brien*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CBMAS是一个用于连续激活导向的诊断框架，将认知偏差分析从离散干预扩展到可解释的轨迹，通过密集α扫描、logit lens偏差曲线和层位点敏感性分析揭示模型行为的临界点和导向效应在层深度的演化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的认知行为在不同提示、层和上下文中编码不可预测，难以诊断和控制，需要一种能够分析连续激活导向的诊断框架。

Method: 结合导向向量构建与密集α扫描、基于logit lens的偏差曲线和层位点敏感性分析，形成连续激活导向诊断框架，揭示行为临界点和导向效应在层深度的演化。

Result: 该方法能够揭示小干预强度翻转模型行为的临界点，展示导向效应在层深度上的演化，为高层行为评估和低层表示动态之间搭建桥梁。

Conclusion: 连续诊断方法为LLMs的认知可解释性提供了桥梁，有助于理解和控制模型的认知行为，项目提供了CLI工具和各种认知行为的数据集。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often encode cognitive behaviors unpredictably across prompts, layers, and contexts, making them difficult to diagnose and control. We present CBMAS, a diagnostic framework for continuous activation steering, which extends cognitive bias analysis from discrete before/after interventions to interpretable trajectories. By combining steering vector construction with dense α-sweeps, logit lens-based bias curves, and layer-site sensitivity analysis, our approach can reveal tipping points where small intervention strengths flip model behavior and show how steering effects evolve across layer depth. We argue that these continuous diagnostics offer a bridge between high-level behavioral evaluation and low-level representational dynamics, contributing to the cognitive interpretability of LLMs. Lastly, we provide a CLI and datasets for various cognitive behaviors at the project repository, https://github.com/shimamooo/CBMAS.

*Aayush Gupta,Farahan Raza Sheikh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Social Digital Twins框架，使用LLM作为个体代理的认知引擎，通过校准层将个体行为聚合为群体指标，用于政策干预预测和反事实分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于历史相关性的统计模型缺乏机制可解释性，难以处理新政策场景。需要一种能够预测政策干预对人口行为影响的通用框架。

Method: 构建虚拟人口副本，其中LLM作为个体代理的认知引擎。每个代理具有人口统计学和心理特征属性，接收政策信号并输出多维行为概率向量。通过校准层将聚合的代理响应映射到可观察的群体层面指标。

Result: 在COVID-19案例研究中，校准后的数字孪生在六个行为类别上的宏观平均预测误差比梯度提升基线降低了20.7%。反事实实验显示对政策变化具有单调且有界的响应，证明了行为合理性。

Conclusion: 该框架是领域无关的，适用于交通政策、经济干预、环境法规等任何政策影响人口行为的场景。讨论了政策模拟的意义、方法的局限性以及将基于LLM的数字孪生扩展到疫情响应之外的未来方向。

Abstract: Predicting how populations respond to policy interventions is a fundamental challenge in computational social science and public policy. Traditional approaches rely on aggregate statistical models that capture historical correlations but lack mechanistic interpretability and struggle with novel policy scenarios. We present a general framework for constructing Social Digital Twins - virtual population replicas where Large Language Models (LLMs) serve as cognitive engines for individual agents. Each agent, characterized by demographic and psychographic attributes, receives policy signals and outputs multi-dimensional behavioral probability vectors. A calibration layer maps aggregated agent responses to observable population-level metrics, enabling validation against real-world data and deployment for counterfactual policy analysis.
  We instantiate this framework in the domain of pandemic response, using COVID-19 as a case study with rich observational data. On a held-out test period, our calibrated digital twin achieves a 20.7% improvement in macro-averaged prediction error over gradient boosting baselines across six behavioral categories. Counterfactual experiments demonstrate monotonic and bounded responses to policy variations, establishing behavioral plausibility. The framework is domain-agnostic: the same architecture applies to transportation policy, economic interventions, environmental regulations, or any setting where policy affects population behavior. We discuss implications for policy simulation, limitations of the approach, and directions for extending LLM-based digital twins beyond pandemic response.

*Aayush Gupta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ReliabilityBench：评估LLM智能体可靠性的新基准，关注一致性、鲁棒性和容错性三个维度，通过统一可靠性表面和混沌工程式故障注入框架进行系统评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具使用型LLM智能体基准主要报告单次运行成功率，缺乏生产环境所需的可靠性评估。需要系统评估智能体在重复执行、任务扰动和工具故障下的表现。

Method: 提出ReliabilityBench基准，包含三个可靠性维度：重复执行一致性（pass^k）、语义等价任务扰动鲁棒性（强度ε）、工具/API故障容错性（强度λ）。引入统一可靠性表面R(k,ε,λ)、动作蜕变关系（基于最终状态等价而非文本相似性定义正确性）和混沌工程式故障注入框架（超时、速率限制、部分响应、模式漂移）。

Result: 评估了2个模型（Gemini 2.0 Flash、GPT-4o）和2种智能体架构（ReAct、Reflexion）在4个领域（调度、旅行、客户支持、电子商务）的1,280个任务。扰动强度从ε=0时的96.9%成功率降至ε=0.2时的88.1%。速率限制是最具破坏性的故障。在综合压力下，ReAct比Reflexion更鲁棒，Gemini 2.0 Flash以更低成本实现了与GPT-4o相当的可靠性。

Conclusion: ReliabilityBench为评估LLM智能体的生产就绪性提供了系统框架，填补了现有基准在可靠性评估方面的空白，有助于更全面地评估智能体在实际部署中的表现。

Abstract: Existing benchmarks for tool-using LLM agents primarily report single-run success rates and miss reliability properties required in production. We introduce \textbf{ReliabilityBench}, a benchmark for evaluating agent reliability across three dimensions: (i) consistency under repeated execution using $\mathrm{pass}^k$, (ii) robustness to semantically equivalent task perturbations at intensity $ε$, and (iii) fault tolerance under controlled tool/API failures at intensity $λ$. ReliabilityBench contributes a unified reliability surface $R(k,ε,λ)$, \textit{action metamorphic relations} that define correctness via end-state equivalence rather than text similarity, and a chaos-engineering-style fault injection framework (timeouts, rate limits, partial responses, schema drift). We evaluate two models (Gemini 2.0 Flash, GPT-4o) and two agent architectures (ReAct, Reflexion) across four domains (scheduling, travel, customer support, e-commerce) over 1,280 episodes. Perturbations alone reduce success from 96.9% at $ε=0$ to 88.1% at $ε=0.2$. Rate limiting is the most damaging fault in ablations. ReAct is more robust than Reflexion under combined stress, and Gemini 2.0 Flash achieves comparable reliability to GPT-4o at much lower cost. ReliabilityBench provides a systematic framework for assessing production readiness of LLM agents.

### [14] [Towards Infinite Length Extrapolation: A Unified Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06113)
*Nitin Vetcha*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了自适应位置编码（APE），通过频率调制和精心设计的衰减偏置来解决LLM长序列处理问题，实现了无限上下文外推。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型处理长序列的能力受限于训练时的上下文窗口大小，现有的长度外推方法存在性能下降或计算效率低的问题。

Method: 提出了统一框架，将位置编码方法重新解释为注意力分数的乘法变换和加法偏置分解。基于此框架设计了自适应位置编码（APE），采用自适应频率调制和包含线性、对数、平方根项的衰减偏置。

Result: 理论分析建立了无限上下文外推的条件，确保softmax归一化在无界序列上保持良好定义，同时保留长距离相关性、熵有界性和梯度位置敏感性。在TinyStories数据集和新的Long Tiny Stories数据集（包含长达32,000词的故事）上进行了实验验证。

Conclusion: APE框架不仅统一了现有位置编码方法，还通过自适应机制克服了它们处理长距离依赖的固有局限性，实现了有效的无限上下文外推。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing, but their ability to process long sequences is fundamentally limited by the context window size during training. Existing length extrapolation methods often suffer from performance degradation or computational inefficiencies. We thereby use a unified framework that reinterprets positional encoding methods as a decomposition of the attention score into a multiplicative transformation and an additive bias. This perspective not only subsumes popular approaches such as relative position embeddings and attention-bias moderated approaches but also exposes their inherent limitations in handling long-range dependencies. To address these shortcomings, motivated by our framework, we introduce Adaptive Positional Encoding (APE), which leverages adaptive frequency modulation and an intricately designed decay bias that incorporates linear, logarithmic, and square-root terms. Our theoretical analysis establishes conditions for infinite-context extrapolation, ensuring that the softmax normalization remains well-defined over unbounded sequences while preserving long-distance correlations, entropy boundedness and gradient positional sensitivity. We substantiate our claims with an experimental case study on TinyStories dataset as well as a new synthetic dataset, \emph{Long Tiny Stories} featuring stories up to 32,000 words. Relevant code, dataset and model weights are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Check-2DAD/.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出"梦境层"概念，将LLM的受控离线幻觉重构为学习资源而非可靠性缺陷，通过人工集体无意识共享抽象交互模板，生成安全但离奇的叙事以增强罕见事件数据和边缘案例测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受个人梦境启发，旨在解决知识共享障碍。当前LLM幻觉被视为可靠性缺陷，但论文认为受控的离线幻觉可作为学习和关系构建的资源，需要重新定义幻觉的价值。

Method: 引入人工集体无意识作为共享梦境池，代理贡献去标识化的抽象交互模板，离线运行时放松逻辑约束并提高采样温度，生成安全但离奇的梦境叙事。添加治理栈包括严格抽象、时间延迟和短暂记忆。

Result: 行为模拟显示梦境层实现关键解耦：代理在安全约束上保持坚定，在叙事策略上变得灵活。离线幻觉成为合成场景和深化陪伴的宝贵资源，而在线未标记实例仍被视为缺陷。

Conclusion: 受控离线幻觉可重构为有价值的资源而非缺陷，梦境层框架使LLM在保持安全性的同时增强适应性和创造力，与神经科学中的抗过拟合梦境机制相呼应。

Abstract: Inspired by a personal dream about knowledge-sharing barriers in an everyday hardware project, this paper proposes a Jung-inspired "Dream Layer" for LLM companions, reframing controlled offline hallucinations as a resource for learning and relationship-building rather than a mere reliability bug. Drawing on Jung's notion of the collective unconscious as a shared repository of archetypal forms, we introduce an Artificial Collective Unconscious (ACU): a shared dream pool where agents contribute de-identified, abstract Interaction Templates that are later re-instantiated as idiosyncratic Dream Narratives. The Dream Layer runs strictly offline: logic-enforcing modules are relaxed and sampling temperature is increased, yielding safe but deliberately bizarre narratives (e.g., travel sequences with mismatched currencies) that augment data for rare events and edge-case safety tests; to harness risk productively, we add a governance stack of strict abstraction, temporal delays, and ephemeral memory. Through behavioural simulations of everyday dialogue and long-horizon adaptation tasks, we show that the Dream Layer enables a critical decoupling: agents remain firm on safety constraints (e.g., security policies) while becoming flexible in narrative strategy (e.g., using shared archetypal metaphors to resolve deadlocks), conceptually reframing hallucination so that online, unmarked instances remain bugs, whereas bounded, marked, and delayed ones become a goldmine for synthetic scenarios and deepened companionship, echoing anti-overfitting dream mechanisms proposed in contemporary neuroscience.

TL;DR: 论文提出"同质化"是AI安全的核心问题，并引入"异质再生产"作为解决方案，旨在促进AI系统的多样性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI模型会复制训练数据中的偏见，并通过模式崩溃进一步放大这些偏见，导致有害的多样性丧失（同质化）。作者认为同质化应该是AI安全的主要关注点。

Method: 提出"异质再生产"作为缓解同质化的策略。对于自回归LLMs，将异质再生产形式化为结构感知的多样性追求。

Result: 本文是基础性贡献，旨在开启重要的研究方向，邀请合作推进多样性研究。

Conclusion: 同质化是AI安全的关键问题，异质再生产是解决这一问题的有前景的方法，需要更多研究来推进AI系统的多样性。

Abstract: Generative AI models reproduce the biases in the training data and can further amplify them through mode collapse. We refer to the resulting harmful loss of diversity as homogenization. Our position is that homogenization should be a primary concern in AI safety. We introduce xeno-reproduction as the strategy that mitigates homogenization. For auto-regressive LLMs, we formalize xeno-reproduction as a structure-aware diversity pursuit. Our contribution is foundational, intended to open an essential line of research and invite collaboration to advance diversity.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现LLM在GPU上运行时，即使配置为确定性执行，仍会产生非确定性结果，主要影响0.1-0.9概率范围内的token概率，而对接近0或1的概率影响较小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注非确定性对LLM生成文本的影响或实现确定性执行的机制，但缺乏对token概率层面非确定性变化的深入分析。本研究旨在填补这一空白，探究非确定性在概率层面的具体表现。

Method: 通过分析LLM在GPU上运行时token概率的变化，而非生成的文本。评估多个模型在token概率层面的非确定性变化趋势和实际数值。

Result: 所有评估模型在token概率变化趋势和实际数值上表现出相似性。非确定性影响在概率0.1-0.9范围内显著，而在概率接近0或1时影响较小。这表明非确定性对生成文本的影响主要来自中等概率token的变化。

Conclusion: 非确定性在温度非零时对生成文本有不可忽视的影响；不同模型在token概率层面有相似的非确定性变化；可以通过单次推理分析token概率来估计非确定性影响，无需多次重复运行。

Abstract: The execution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has been shown to produce nondeterministic results when run on Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), even when they are configured to produce deterministic results. This is due to the finite precision effects of the arithmetic operations, which depend on the order in which they are executed. This order, in turn, depends on the processes that are running concurrently on the GPU. Previous studies have focused on the impact of nondeterminism on the text generated by the LLMs or on proposing mechanisms to achieve deterministic execution. This work takes a closer look at nondeterminism by analyzing the variations on the token probabilities, not on the generated text. Interestingly, all the models evaluated have similar results in both the trends and the actual values of the variations of the probabilities. In particular, the results show that the effects of nondeterminism are significant for token probabilities that are in the range of 0.1 to 0.9, while they are much smaller when the probabilities are close to 0 or 1. This has significant implications for our understanding of nondeterminism. The first is that nondeterminism will likely have a non-negligible impact on generated text when the temperature is not zero, as it introduces significant variations in the token probabilities except when they are close to 0 or 1. Secondly, it suggests that all models have similar non deterministic variations at the token probability level. Therefore, different variations in the performance of the generated text, for example, when measuring accuracy on a benchmark, seem to come from different token probabilities or response lengths. A third implication is that we may be able to estimate the impact of nondeterminism by running a single inference and analyzing the token level probabilities, instead of having to run the same inference many times.

*Boshen Shi,Kexin Yang,Yuanbo Yang,Guanguang Chang,Ce Chi,Zhendong Wang,Xing Wang,Junlan Feng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NL2Dashboard是一个轻量级框架，通过分析-呈现解耦原则，使用结构化中间表示来生成仪表板，显著提升视觉质量、token效率和可控性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在生成独立图表方面表现出色，但合成综合仪表板仍面临挑战。现有的端到端范式（如直接生成HTML代码）存在两个根本限制：1）视觉渲染导致大量token的表示冗余；2）分析推理与呈现纠缠导致低可控性。

Method: 提出NL2Dashboard框架，基于分析-呈现解耦原则。引入结构化中间表示（IR）来封装仪表板的内容、布局和视觉元素。将LLM的角色限制在数据分析和意图翻译，而将视觉合成卸载给确定性渲染引擎。在此基础上开发多智能体系统，将IR驱动的算法实例化为工具套件。

Result: 综合实验表明，NL2Dashboard在多个领域显著优于最先进的基线方法，实现了更优的视觉质量、显著更高的token效率，以及在生成和修改任务中的精确可控性。

Conclusion: 通过分析-呈现解耦和结构化中间表示，NL2Dashboard有效解决了仪表板生成中的表示冗余和可控性问题，为LLM驱动的仪表板合成提供了高效且可控的解决方案。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in generating standalone charts, synthesizing comprehensive dashboards remains a formidable challenge. Existing end-to-end paradigms, which typically treat dashboard generation as a direct code generation task (e.g., raw HTML), suffer from two fundamental limitations: representation redundancy due to massive tokens spent on visual rendering, and low controllability caused by the entanglement of analytical reasoning and presentation. To address these challenges, we propose NL2Dashboard, a lightweight framework grounded in the principle of Analysis-Presentation Decoupling. We introduce a structured intermediate representation (IR) that encapsulates the dashboard's content, layout, and visual elements. Therefore, it confines the LLM's role to data analysis and intent translation, while offloading visual synthesis to a deterministic rendering engine. Building upon this framework, we develop a multi-agent system in which the IR-driven algorithm is instantiated as a suite of tools. Comprehensive experiments conducted with this system demonstrate that NL2Dashboard significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across diverse domains, achieving superior visual quality, significantly higher token efficiency, and precise controllability in both generation and modification tasks.

TL;DR: HiMeS：受海马体-新皮层记忆机制启发的AI助手架构，融合短期和长期记忆，提升个性化知识密集型场景中的问答质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统检索增强生成（RAG）管道在需要用户特定个性化的知识密集型场景中存在内存容量有限、检索机制与用户特定对话历史协调不足的问题，导致冗余澄清、不相关文档和用户体验下降

Method: 1. 短期记忆提取器：通过强化学习端到端训练，压缩最近对话并主动预检索知识库文档，模拟海马体与前额叶皮层的协作交互
2. 分区长期记忆网络：存储用户特定信息并重新排序检索到的文档，模拟分布式皮层存储和记忆重新激活

Result: 在真实世界工业数据集上，HiMeS在问答质量方面显著优于级联RAG基线。消融研究证实了两个记忆模块的必要性

Conclusion: HiMeS为构建更可靠、上下文感知、用户定制的基于LLM的助手提供了实用路径，通过模拟生物记忆机制有效解决了传统RAG的局限性

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) power many interactive systems such as chatbots, customer-service agents, and personal assistants. In knowledge-intensive scenarios requiring user-specific personalization, conventional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines exhibit limited memory capacity and insufficient coordination between retrieval mechanisms and user-specific conversational history, leading to redundant clarification, irrelevant documents, and degraded user experience. Inspired by the hippocampus-neocortex memory mechanism, we propose HiMeS, an AI-assistant architecture that fuses short-term and long-term memory. Our contributions are fourfold: (1) A short-term memory extractor is trained end-to-end with reinforcement learning to compress recent dialogue and proactively pre-retrieve documents from the knowledge base, emulating the cooperative interaction between the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. (2) A partitioned long-term memory network stores user-specific information and re-ranks retrieved documents, simulating distributed cortical storage and memory reactivation. (3) On a real-world industrial dataset, HiMeS significantly outperforms a cascaded RAG baseline on question-answering quality. (4) Ablation studies confirm the necessity of both memory modules and suggest a practical path toward more reliable, context-aware, user-customized LLM-based assistants.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要建模人类智能体中性格特质与社会结构的交互，以创建更真实、稳定且情境敏感的人格驱动智能体。

Method: 1. 个体结构（IS）：编码大五人格特质、认知风格、价值观、文化资本等；2. 多场景情境化（MSC）：涵盖8个社会场景的角色-关系-规范框架；3. 通过结构化提示将场景绑定到智能体档案；4. 合成监督数据微调小规模LLM。

Result: 微调后的小模型在人格一致性、情境适当性、风格匹配、特质可识别性和长期稳定性等指标上，匹配或超越了多个更大的未调优LLM和其他基线模型。

Conclusion: PsyAgent提供了一个精确、数据高效的人格驱动智能体架构，IS主要提升特质保真度和风格稳定性，MSC驱动规范意识和决策适应性，两者结合实现跨场景性能。

Abstract: Human-like agents require modeling how dispositions interact with social structure. We present PsyAgent, which couples a Big Five trait prior with Bourdieu's cognitive-social co-structure. PsyAgent comprises: (i) Individual Structure (IS), a machine-usable profile encoding traits and facets, cognitive style, values, cultural and educational capital, and salient life episodes; and (ii) Multi-Scenario Contexting (MSC), role-relationship-norm frames spanning eight arenas (work, family, friendship, strangers and civic life, solitude and self-regulation, romance, learning, and public expression). At inference, fixed structured prompts bind the active scenario to the agent profile, yielding behavior that is stable yet context-sensitive. We instantiate IS and MSC to synthesize supervision (role-play dialogues, decision probes, feedback trajectories) and then fine-tune a small LLM. The resulting model produces consistent, identifiable persona-aligned behaviors for specified Big Five configurations and matches or exceeds several larger untuned LLMs and other untuned baselines on our metrics: persona consistency, contextual appropriateness, style matching, trait identifiability, and long-horizon stability. Ablations show IS chiefly improves trait fidelity and stylistic stability, while MSC drives norm awareness and decision fit; both are necessary for cross-scenario performance. PsyAgent offers a precise, data-efficient architecture for personality-grounded agents.

TL;DR: SOE框架通过"学生引导教师"范式，利用弱辅助代理作为正交探针，在教师模型的零空间中导航，解决LLM在复杂推理任务中的"推理崩溃"问题，显著提升数学基准测试的准确性和采样效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在复杂数学证明和长程规划任务中经常出现"推理崩溃"现象，模型会退化到低秩偏置流形，随机采样仅产生错误逻辑的词汇变体而非语义探索，导致模型无法发现零空间中的高价值解决方案。

Method: 提出谱正交探索（SOE）几何框架，采用"学生引导教师"的反直觉范式。使用弱辅助代理不是用于模仿，而是作为正交探针，通过显式导航教师模型的零空间，将模型从局部最优中弹出，探索多样化的高价值解决方案空间。

Result: 在数学基准测试中，相对于基线方法，SOE将平均准确率提高了62.4%，平均采样效率提高了113.7%，表明该方法在克服高级推理任务性能瓶颈方面具有前景。

Conclusion: SOE框架通过几何方法有效解决了LLM的推理崩溃问题，为克服高级推理任务中的性能瓶颈提供了一条有希望的路径，通过探索模型的零空间来发现被传统方法忽略的高价值解决方案。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate near-human capabilities, they often suffer from "Reasoning Collapse" in complex mathematical proving and long-horizon planning. Models tend to degenerate into low-rank Bias Manifold, where stochastic sampling merely produces lexical variations of erroneous logic rather than semantic exploration. This geometric collapse renders the model "blind" to high-value solutions that lie within its Null Space. To address this, we propose Spectral Orthogonal Exploration (SOE), a geometric framework operating on a counter-intuitive "Student Guides Teacher" paradigm. Specifically, we utilize a weak auxiliary agent not for imitation, but as an orthogonal probe. By explicitly navigating the Teacher's Null Space, SOE serves as a geometric bridge, effectively ejecting the model from local optima to explore diverse, high-value solution spaces. Experiments on mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that, relative to baseline methods, our approach improves average accuracy by 62.4% and increases average sampling efficiency by 113.7%, indicating a promising path toward overcoming performance plateaus in advanced reasoning tasks.

Motivation: AI系统在医疗领域达到专家级预测精度，但模型性能提升往往未能转化为患者结果的改善。作者旨在解释这种"分配差距"，为资源受限环境中的医疗AI评估和部署提供理论基础

Method: 将医疗服务提供建模为资源约束下的随机分配问题，使用约束优化和马尔可夫决策过程(MDP)分析AI作为决策基础设施的作用。通过合成分诊模拟比较分配感知策略与风险阈值方法

Result: 分配感知策略在实现效用方面显著优于风险阈值方法，即使预测精度相同。框架为资源受限环境中评估和部署医疗AI提供了原则性基础

Conclusion: 医疗AI应被视为估计效用的决策基础设施而非自主决策者。在资源约束下，分配感知策略比单纯依赖预测精度的传统方法更能改善患者结果，为解决AI预测与临床结果之间的差距提供了理论框架

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems increasingly achieve expert-level predictive accuracy in healthcare, yet improvements in model performance often fail to produce corresponding gains in patient outcomes. We term this disconnect the allocation gap and provide a decision-theoretic explanation by modelling healthcare delivery as a stochastic allocation problem under binding resource constraints. In this framework, AI acts as decision infrastructure that estimates utility rather than making autonomous decisions. Using constrained optimisation and Markov decision processes, we show how improved estimation affects optimal allocation under scarcity. A synthetic triage simulation demonstrates that allocation-aware policies substantially outperform risk-threshold approaches in realised utility, even with identical predictive accuracy. The framework provides a principled basis for evaluating and deploying healthcare AI in resource-constrained settings.

Conclusion: 建立了优化式合规应用的初步基础，强调逻辑驱动的优化而非事后解释，提供可验证的法律一致性推理

Abstract: Financial regulations are increasingly complex, hindering automated compliance-especially the maintenance of logical consistency with minimal human oversight. We introduce a Neuro-Symbolic Compliance Framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solvers to enable formal verifiability and optimization-based compliance correction. The LLM interprets statutes and enforcement cases to generate SMT constraints, while the solver enforces consistency and computes the minimal factual modification required to restore legality when penalties arise. Unlike transparency-oriented methods, our approach emphasizes logic-driven optimization, delivering verifiable, legally consistent reasoning rather than post-hoc explanation. Evaluated on 87 enforcement cases from Taiwan's Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC), the system attains 86.2% correctness in SMT code generation, improves reasoning efficiency by over 100x, and consistently corrects violations-establishing a preliminary foundation for optimization-based compliance applications.

Motivation: 随着地球观测卫星星座规模和能力的快速增长，需要利用分布式星上控制实现时间敏感的测量和响应。但卫星部署自主性需要高效的计算和通信，面临数百颗卫星、数百万变量的动态大规模调度挑战。

Method: 1) 提出动态多卫星星座观测调度问题(DCOSP)，作为动态分布式约束优化问题(DDCOP)的新形式化，建模集成调度与执行；2) 为DCOSP构建全知离线算法计算最优性条件；3) 提出动态增量邻域随机搜索算法(D-NSS)，基于分解的不完整在线DDCOP算法，在问题动态发生时修复和解决子问题。

Abstract: The size and capabilities of Earth-observing satellite constellations are rapidly increasing. Leveraging distributed onboard control, we can enable novel time-sensitive measurements and responses. However, deploying autonomy to satellites requires efficient computation and communication. This work tackles the challenge of efficiently scheduling observations for hundreds of satellites in a dynamic, large-scale problem with millions of variables. We present the Dynamic Multi-Satellite Constellation Observation Scheduling Problem (DCOSP), a new formulation of Dynamic Distributed Constraint Optimization Problems (DDCOP) that models integrated scheduling and execution. DCOSP has a novel optimality condition for which we construct an omniscient offline algorithm for its computation. We also present the Dynamic Incremental Neighborhood Stochastic Search algorithm (D-NSS), an incomplete online decomposition-based DDCOP algorithm that repairs and solves sub-problems when problem dynamics occur. We show through simulation that D-NSS converges to near-optimal solutions and outperforms DDCOP baselines in terms of solution quality, computation time, and message volume. As part of the NASA FAME mission, DCOSP and D-NSS will be the foundation of the largest in-space demonstration of distributed multi-agent AI to date.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LLM在检索增强生成中如何整合冲突证据的机制，探究模型是基于事实强度、先验信念还是重复频率来形成答案。

Method: 构建GroupQA数据集（1,635个争议问题，15,058份多样化证据文档），通过控制实验分析群体级证据聚合动态，包括复述与独立支持对比、顺序效应、模型大小影响等。

Result: 发现：1) 复述论点比提供独立支持更具说服力；2) 模型偏好最先呈现的证据而非最后；3) 更大模型更抗拒适应新证据；4) LLM对群体答案的解释不忠实。

Conclusion: LLM表现为脆弱的启发式追随者，这对改进RAG系统设计有直接启示，需要更可靠的证据整合机制。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is the prevailing paradigm for grounding Large Language Models (LLMs), yet the mechanisms governing how models integrate groups of conflicting retrieved evidence remain opaque. Does an LLM answer a certain way because the evidence is factually strong, because of a prior belief, or merely because it is repeated frequently? To answer this, we introduce GroupQA, a curated dataset of 1,635 controversial questions paired with 15,058 diversely-sourced evidence documents, annotated for stance and qualitative strength. Through controlled experiments, we characterize group-level evidence aggregation dynamics: Paraphrasing an argument can be more persuasive than providing distinct independent support; Models favor evidence presented first rather than last, and Larger models are increasingly resistant to adapt to presented evidence. Additionally, we find that LLM explanations to group-based answers are unfaithful. Together, we show that LLMs behave consistently as vulnerable heuristic followers, with direct implications for improving RAG system design.

*Weijie Li,Zhongqing Wang,Guodong Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出PCoKG人格感知常识知识图谱，包含52万四元组，通过LLM角色扮演和辩论机制构建，用于个性化对话生成，提升AI系统的个性化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有常识推理模型忽视人格特质的影响，限制了在个性化系统（如对话生成）中的有效性，需要构建能够反映人格差异的常识知识库。

Method: 1) 从ATOMIC数据集中筛选可能引发不同人格类型推理模式的事件；2) 利用LLM角色扮演能力进行推理任务；3) 引入辩论机制（支持者、反对者、裁判）通过反馈循环迭代优化生成的知识；4) 构建包含521,316个四元组的PCoKG数据集。

Result: 1) 构建了PCoKG人格感知常识知识图谱；2) LoRA微调实验显示模型性能与基础模型参数规模正相关；3) 在基于人格的对话生成任务中，PCoKG提升了生成响应与参考输出之间的一致性。

Conclusion: PCoKG填补了常识推理与个体认知差异之间的空白，为开发更个性化、上下文感知的AI系统提供了基础，推动了人格感知AI的发展。

Abstract: Most commonsense reasoning models overlook the influence of personality traits, limiting their effectiveness in personalized systems such as dialogue generation. To address this limitation, we introduce the Personality-aware Commonsense Knowledge Graph (PCoKG), a structured dataset comprising 521,316 quadruples. We begin by employing three evaluators to score and filter events from the ATOMIC dataset, selecting those that are likely to elicit diverse reasoning patterns across different personality types. For knowledge graph construction, we leverage the role-playing capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to perform reasoning tasks. To enhance the quality of the generated knowledge, we incorporate a debate mechanism consisting of a proponent, an opponent, and a judge, which iteratively refines the outputs through feedback loops. We evaluate the dataset from multiple perspectives and conduct fine-tuning and ablation experiments using multiple LLM backbones to assess PCoKG's robustness and the effectiveness of its construction pipeline. Our LoRA-based fine-tuning results indicate a positive correlation between model performance and the parameter scale of the base models. Finally, we apply PCoKG to persona-based dialogue generation, where it demonstrates improved consistency between generated responses and reference outputs. This work bridges the gap between commonsense reasoning and individual cognitive differences, enabling the development of more personalized and context-aware AI systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一个开放世界工具使用环境，包含5,571个统一格式的工具和任务生成引擎，用于训练和测试LLM代理在复杂场景下的工具使用能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前使用工具的LLM代理在开放世界环境中面临挑战：工具池庞大、目标长期化、约束复杂、工具状态不可靠。需要更可扩展和现实的训练测试环境。

Method: 1) 构建开放世界工具使用环境：5,571个统一格式工具，204个常用应用；2) 任务生成引擎：合成长期、多工具工作流；3) 状态控制器：注入中断和故障测试鲁棒性；4) 工具选择-执行代理框架：规划器-执行器分解。

Result: 评估显示：工具规划与执行能力不匹配；现有LLM约束遵循能力弱；DeepSeek-v3.2鲁棒性最强。用1,170条轨迹微调LLM，性能优于使用119k样本的基线，表明环境作为基准和数据引擎的价值。

Conclusion: 该开放世界工具使用环境既是一个现实的基准测试平台，也是工具使用代理的数据生成引擎，有助于提升LLM在复杂场景下的工具使用能力。

Abstract: Tool-using LLM agents still struggle in open-world settings with large tool pools, long-horizon objectives, wild constraints, and unreliable tool states. For scalable and realistic training and testing, we introduce an open-world tool-using environment, built on 5,571 format unified tools across 204 commonly used apps. It includes a task creation engine that synthesizes long-horizon, multi-tool workflows with wild constraints, and a state controller that injects interruptions and failures to stress-test robustness. On top of this environment, we develop a tool select-then-execute agent framework with a planner-actor decomposition to separate deliberate reasoning and self-correction from step-wise execution. Comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs reveals the misalignment between tool planning and execution abilities, the constraint following weakness of existing LLMs, and DeepSeek-v3.2's strongest robustness. Finally, we collect 1,170 trajectories from our environment to fine-tune LLMs, achieving superior performance to baselines using 119k samples, indicating the environment's value as both a realistic benchmark and a data engine for tool-using agents. Our code and data will be publicly released.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于参数设计特征的制造可行性评估方法，使用Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks直接学习设计参数、公差和制造结果之间的函数关系，避免了传统几何驱动方法的信息损失和可解释性差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前制造可行性评估主要依赖几何驱动的人工智能方法，这些方法需要大量预处理、存在信息损失且可解释性有限。需要一种能够直接从参数设计特征评估制造可行性、明确纳入尺寸公差且无需CAD处理的方法。

Method: 采用Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks学习设计参数、公差和制造可行性之间的函数关系。生成包含30万个标记设计的合成数据集，评估三种代表性场景：钻孔、型腔铣削和组合钻孔-铣削，同时考虑加工约束和面向制造的设计规则。

Result: KAN在所有场景中表现最佳：钻孔AUC为0.9919，铣削AUC为0.9841，组合案例AUC为0.9406。相比14个机器学习和深度学习模型，KAN性能最优。通过样条函数可视化和潜在空间投影提供高可解释性，能够识别对制造可行性影响最大的设计和公差参数。

Conclusion: 该框架直接从参数设计特征评估制造可行性，避免了CAD处理需求，提供了高可解释性。工业案例研究表明，该方法能够通过迭代的参数级设计修改，将不可制造的组件转化为可制造组件，有效弥合设计与生产之间的差距。

Abstract: Manufacturability assessment is a critical step in bridging the persistent gap between design and production. While artificial intelligence (AI) has been widely applied to this task, most existing frameworks rely on geometry-driven methods that require extensive preprocessing, suffer from information loss, and offer limited interpretability. This study proposes a methodology that evaluates manufacturability directly from parametric design features, enabling explicit incorporation of dimensional tolerances without requiring computer-aided design (CAD) processing. The approach employs Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) to learn functional relationships between design parameters, tolerances, and manufacturability outcomes. A synthetic dataset of 300,000 labeled designs is generated to evaluate performance across three representative scenarios: hole drilling, pocket milling, and combined drilling-milling, while accounting for machining constraints and design-for-manufacturing (DFM) rules. Benchmarking against fourteen machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models shows that KAN achieves the highest performance in all scenarios, with AUC values of 0.9919 for drilling, 0.9841 for milling, and 0.9406 for the combined case. The proposed framework provides high interpretability through spline-based functional visualizations and latent-space projections, enabling identification of the design and tolerance parameters that most strongly influence manufacturability. An industrial case study further demonstrates how the framework enables iterative, parameter-level design modifications that transform a non-manufacturable component into a manufacturable one.

*Binxu Wang,Jingxuan Fan,Xu Pan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究通过机制可解释性方法分析扩散变换器如何生成正确的物体空间关系，发现不同文本编码器导致不同的信息处理机制


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管扩散变换器在文本到图像生成方面取得进展，但模型仍难以根据文本提示正确生成物体间的空间关系，需要深入理解其工作机制

Method: 采用机制可解释性方法，从头训练不同尺寸的扩散变换器，使用不同文本编码器（随机嵌入和预训练T5），学习生成包含两个物体及其空间关系的图像

Result: 所有模型都能近乎完美地学习任务，但工作机制因文本编码器而异：随机嵌入时通过两阶段电路处理空间关系和物体属性；使用T5时通过单文本令牌融合信息处理

Conclusion: 不同文本编码器导致不同的信息处理机制，虽然域内性能相似，但对域外扰动的鲁棒性不同，这可能解释了真实场景中生成正确空间关系的困难

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have greatly advanced text-to-image generation, but models still struggle to generate the correct spatial relations between objects as specified in the text prompt. In this study, we adopt a mechanistic interpretability approach to investigate how a DiT can generate correct spatial relations between objects. We train, from scratch, DiTs of different sizes with different text encoders to learn to generate images containing two objects whose attributes and spatial relations are specified in the text prompt. We find that, although all the models can learn this task to near-perfect accuracy, the underlying mechanisms differ drastically depending on the choice of text encoder. When using random text embeddings, we find that the spatial-relation information is passed to image tokens through a two-stage circuit, involving two cross-attention heads that separately read the spatial relation and single-object attributes in the text prompt. When using a pretrained text encoder (T5), we find that the DiT uses a different circuit that leverages information fusion in the text tokens, reading spatial-relation and single-object information together from a single text token. We further show that, although the in-domain performance is similar for the two settings, their robustness to out-of-domain perturbations differs, potentially suggesting the difficulty of generating correct relations in real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: CARD是一个分层个性化框架，通过聚类用户和隐式偏好学习实现高效个性化文本生成，保持基础模型冻结，在解码时注入个性化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在个性化方面面临细粒度个性化与可扩展部署之间的张力，需要一种既能有效个性化又能高效部署的解决方案。

Method: CARD采用分层框架：1) 根据共享风格模式聚类用户并学习聚类特定的LoRA适配器；2) 通过对比用户撰写文本与聚类级生成，隐式学习用户偏好；3) 推理时通过轻量级用户偏好向量和低秩logit修正注入个性化，保持基础模型冻结。

Result: 在LaMP和LongLaMP基准测试中，CARD实现了与最先进基线相当或更优的生成质量，同时显著提高了效率和可扩展性。

Conclusion: CARD通过分层渐进细化和隐式偏好学习，在保持基础模型冻结的同时实现高效个性化，为实际个性化文本生成提供了可扩展解决方案。

Abstract: Adapting large language models to individual users remains challenging due to the tension between fine-grained personalization and scalable deployment. We present CARD, a hierarchical framework that achieves effective personalization through progressive refinement. CARD first clusters users according to shared stylistic patterns and learns cluster-specific LoRA adapters, enabling robust generalization and strong low-resource performance. To capture individual differences within each cluster, we propose an implicit preference learning mechanism that contrasts user-authored text with cluster-level generations, allowing the model to infer user-specific style preferences without manual annotation. At inference time, CARD injects personalization exclusively at decoding via lightweight user preference vectors and low-rank logit corrections, while keeping the base model frozen. Experiments on the LaMP and LongLaMP benchmarks show that CARD achieves competitive or superior generation quality compared to state-of-the-art baselines, while significantly improving efficiency and scalability for practical personalized text generation.

TL;DR: PsPLUG：通过风格条件偏好对比的轻量级软提示插件，将个性化建模为分布残差，在保持风格忠实度的同时提升个性化对齐


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现个性化文本生成中一个被忽视的挑战：个性化方法越来越多地在显式风格指令下应用，但其在这种约束下的行为仍未被充分理解。需要平衡隐式个性化和显式风格要求。

Method: 将个性化建模为分布残差，提出PsPLUG——一个轻量级的软提示插件，通过风格条件偏好对比进行训练。该方法在保持计算效率的同时实现可控的个性化。

Result: 在LaMP基准测试中，该框架提高了个性化对齐度，保持了风格忠实度，并以最小计算量优于基于检索和软提示的基线方法。

Conclusion: 残差建模为可控的、风格感知的大语言模型个性化提供了一个简单而原则性的基础，展示了在显式风格约束下实现有效个性化的可行性。

Abstract: We discover a previously overlooked challenge in personalized text generation: personalization methods are increasingly applied under explicit style instructions, yet their behavior under such constraints remains poorly understood. To balance implicit personalization and explicit style, we formulate personalization as a distributional residual and propose PsPLUG, a lightweight soft-prompt plug-in trained with style-conditioned preference contrasts. Across LaMP benchmark, our framework improves persona alignment, maintains stylistic fidelity, and outperforms retrieval-based and soft-prompt baselines with minimal computation. These results show that residual modeling provides a simple and principled foundation for controllable, style-aware LLM personalization.

Motivation: 现有长期记忆系统在适应性、可扩展性和持续交互下的自我演化方面存在局限，需要更符合认知理论的设计来支持长对话场景。

Method: 提出分层记忆框架：1) 通过主题感知事件-惊喜双通道分割构建情节记忆；2) 通过多阶段信息提取构建笔记记忆；3) 语义链接形成层次结构；4) 支持混合和尽力检索策略；5) 基于冲突感知的记忆再巩固机制进行动态更新。

Conclusion: HiMem为构建自适应和自我演化的基于LLM的对话代理提供了一个原则性和可扩展的设计范式。

Abstract: Although long-term memory systems have made substantial progress in recent years, they still exhibit clear limitations in adaptability, scalability, and self-evolution under continuous interaction settings. Inspired by cognitive theories, we propose HiMem, a hierarchical long-term memory framework for long-horizon dialogues, designed to support memory construction, retrieval, and dynamic updating during sustained interactions. HiMem constructs cognitively consistent Episode Memory via a Topic-Aware Event--Surprise Dual-Channel Segmentation strategy, and builds Note Memory that captures stable knowledge through a multi-stage information extraction pipeline. These two memory types are semantically linked to form a hierarchical structure that bridges concrete interaction events and abstract knowledge, enabling efficient retrieval without sacrificing information fidelity. HiMem supports both hybrid and best-effort retrieval strategies to balance accuracy and efficiency, and incorporates conflict-aware Memory Reconsolidation to revise and supplement stored knowledge based on retrieval feedback. This design enables continual memory self-evolution over long-term use. Experimental results on long-horizon dialogue benchmarks demonstrate that HiMem consistently outperforms representative baselines in accuracy, consistency, and long-term reasoning, while maintaining favorable efficiency. Overall, HiMem provides a principled and scalable design paradigm for building adaptive and self-evolving LLM-based conversational agents. The code is available at https://github.com/jojopdq/HiMem.

Motivation: 现有金融LLM基准存在依赖模拟或通用样本、关注单一离线静态场景等问题，导致基准性能与实际运营效果存在显著差距，无法满足金融服务对真实性和实时响应的要求。

Method: 基于中美股市真实业务数据构建基准，对金融平台真实用户查询进行聚类分析，形成8个基础任务和2个在线任务，覆盖4个核心业务场景，共29,578个专家级问答对。

Result: ChatGPT-5在主任务中达到61.5%准确率，但与金融专家仍有显著差距；在线任务中DeepSeek-R1优于其他商业LLM。错误分析揭示了现有模型在实际金融业务场景中的具体能力缺陷。

Conclusion: BizFinBench.v2超越了现有基准的限制，实现了LLM金融能力的业务级解构，为评估LLM在金融领域广泛部署的有效性提供了精确依据。

Abstract: Large language models have undergone rapid evolution, emerging as a pivotal technology for intelligence in financial operations. However, existing benchmarks are often constrained by pitfalls such as reliance on simulated or general-purpose samples and a focus on singular, offline static scenarios. Consequently, they fail to align with the requirements for authenticity and real-time responsiveness in financial services, leading to a significant discrepancy between benchmark performance and actual operational efficacy. To address this, we introduce BizFinBench.v2, the first large-scale evaluation benchmark grounded in authentic business data from both Chinese and U.S. equity markets, integrating online assessment. We performed clustering analysis on authentic user queries from financial platforms, resulting in eight fundamental tasks and two online tasks across four core business scenarios, totaling 29,578 expert-level Q&A pairs. Experimental results demonstrate that ChatGPT-5 achieves a prominent 61.5% accuracy in main tasks, though a substantial gap relative to financial experts persists; in online tasks, DeepSeek-R1 outperforms all other commercial LLMs. Error analysis further identifies the specific capability deficiencies of existing models within practical financial business contexts. BizFinBench.v2 transcends the limitations of current benchmarks, achieving a business-level deconstruction of LLM financial capabilities and providing a precise basis for evaluating efficacy in the widespread deployment of LLMs within the financial domain.

### [35] [Does Inference Scaling Improve Reasoning Faithfulness? A Multi-Model Analysis of Self-Consistency Tradeoffs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06423)
*Deep Mehta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 自洽性技术能提高大语言模型在推理任务上的准确率，但不同模型在推理忠实性上表现差异显著，并非所有模型都能从自洽性中获益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究自洽性技术是否真正提高了大语言模型的推理忠实性，而非仅仅提升准确率。目前尚不清楚自洽性带来的准确率提升是否反映了推理质量的真实改进。

Method: 在四个前沿模型（GPT-5.2、Claude Opus 4.5、Gemini-3-flash-preview、DeepSeek-v3.2）上对100个GSM8K数学推理问题进行实证研究，使用bootstrap置信区间、McNemar配对检验和Cohen's d效应量进行严格量化分析。

Result: 不同模型表现差异显著：GPT-5.2准确率从78%提升到90%，忠实性相对稳定；Claude Opus 4.5准确率从78%下降到74.3%，但忠实性从0.270大幅提升到0.891；DeepSeek-v3.2已达98%准确率天花板；Gemini-3-flash准确率提升但忠实性略有下降。问题难度分析显示GPT-5.2能解决82%难题但仅破坏13%简单题，而Claude破坏了23%简单题。

Conclusion: 自洽性并非普遍有益，不同模型在准确率和推理忠实性之间存在不同权衡。实践者应在部署前测试特定模型，不能假设自洽性对所有模型都有利。研究提供了实用建议并开源了代码。

Abstract: Self-consistency has emerged as a popular technique for improving large language model accuracy on reasoning tasks. The approach is straightforward: generate multiple reasoning paths and select the most common answer through majority voting. While this reliably boosts accuracy, it remains unclear whether these gains reflect genuine improvements in reasoning quality. We investigate a fundamental question that has not been studied before: does inference scaling improve reasoning faithfulness?
  We conduct a comprehensive empirical study across four frontier models (GPT-5.2, Claude Opus 4.5, Gemini-3-flash-preview, and DeepSeek-v3.2) on 100 GSM8K mathematical reasoning problems. Our analysis employs bootstrap confidence intervals, McNemar's tests for paired comparisons, and Cohen's d effect sizes to quantify the effects rigorously. The results reveal striking differences across models that challenge common assumptions about self-consistency.
  GPT-5.2 shows the expected pattern: accuracy improves from 78% to 90% at N=5, with faithfulness remaining relatively stable (0.540 to 0.510). Claude Opus 4.5 tells a completely different story. Its accuracy actually drops from 78% to 74.3% while faithfulness jumps dramatically from 0.270 to 0.891 at N=5. DeepSeek-v3.2, already at 98% accuracy, shows ceiling effects with modest faithfulness gains (0.440 to 0.541). Gemini-3-flash improves from 81% to 86% accuracy with a slight faithfulness decrease (0.260 to 0.212).
  Problem difficulty analysis reveals that GPT-5.2 solves 82% of hard problems while breaking only 13% of easy ones. Claude, in contrast, breaks 23% of easy problems, explaining its accuracy decrease. These findings matter for practitioners: self-consistency is not universally beneficial, and teams should test their specific models before deployment. We release our code and provide practical recommendations for navigating these tradeoffs.

TL;DR: LSRIF：逻辑结构化训练框架，通过构建包含并行、顺序、条件约束的数据集，并设计结构感知的奖励方法，显著提升大语言模型的指令跟随能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界指令常包含顺序依赖和条件分支等逻辑结构，现有方法通常构建并行约束数据集并优化平均奖励，忽略了逻辑依赖关系，导致噪声信号。

Method: 提出LSRIF框架：1) 构建LSRInstruct数据集，包含并行、顺序、条件三种约束结构；2) 设计结构感知奖励方法：并行结构用平均聚合，顺序结构用失败惩罚传播，条件分支用选择性奖励。

Result: 实验显示LSRIF在指令跟随（域内和域外）和通用推理方面带来显著改进。分析表明，学习显式逻辑结构会带来注意力层的参数更新，并增强对约束和逻辑运算符的token级注意力。

Conclusion: 显式建模指令逻辑结构能有效提升大语言模型的指令跟随能力，LSRIF框架通过结构感知的奖励设计解决了现有方法忽略逻辑依赖的问题。

Abstract: Instruction-following is critical for large language models, but real-world instructions often contain logical structures such as sequential dependencies and conditional branching. Existing methods typically construct datasets with parallel constraints and optimize average rewards, ignoring logical dependencies and yielding noisy signals. We propose a logic-structured training framework LSRIF that explicitly models instruction logic. We first construct a dataset LSRInstruct with constraint structures such as parallel, sequential, and conditional types, and then design structure-aware rewarding method LSRIF including average aggregation for parallel structures, failure-penalty propagation for sequential structures, and selective rewards for conditional branches. Experiments show LSRIF brings significant improvements in instruction-following (in-domain and out-of-domain) and general reasoning. Analysis reveals that learning with explicit logic structures brings parameter updates in attention layers and sharpens token-level attention to constraints and logical operators.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型在处理异构多模态传感器数据时存在挑战，单一模型往往无法跨模态连贯推理，导致解释不完整和先验知识偏见。需要更可靠的方法来处理传感器噪声和缺失数据。

Method: 提出ConSensus框架：1) 将多模态感知任务分解为专门的模态感知智能体；2) 采用混合融合机制，结合语义聚合（支持跨模态推理和上下文理解）和统计共识（通过跨模态一致性提供鲁棒性）；3) 单轮混合融合协议减少计算成本。

Result: 在五个不同的多模态感知基准测试中，平均准确率比单智能体基线提高7.1%。与迭代多智能体辩论方法相比，性能相当或更优，同时平均融合令牌成本减少12.7倍。

Conclusion: ConSensus通过多智能体协作和混合融合机制，为现实世界的多模态感知任务提供了鲁棒且高效的解决方案，能够有效处理传感器噪声和缺失数据，同时显著降低计算成本。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly grounded in sensor data to perceive and reason about human physiology and the physical world. However, accurately interpreting heterogeneous multimodal sensor data remains a fundamental challenge. We show that a single monolithic LLM often fails to reason coherently across modalities, leading to incomplete interpretations and prior-knowledge bias. We introduce ConSensus, a training-free multi-agent collaboration framework that decomposes multimodal sensing tasks into specialized, modality-aware agents. To aggregate agent-level interpretations, we propose a hybrid fusion mechanism that balances semantic aggregation, which enables cross-modal reasoning and contextual understanding, with statistical consensus, which provides robustness through agreement across modalities. While each approach has complementary failure modes, their combination enables reliable inference under sensor noise and missing data. We evaluate ConSensus on five diverse multimodal sensing benchmarks, demonstrating an average accuracy improvement of 7.1% over the single-agent baseline. Furthermore, ConSensus matches or exceeds the performance of iterative multi-agent debate methods while achieving a 12.7 times reduction in average fusion token cost through a single-round hybrid fusion protocol, yielding a robust and efficient solution for real-world multimodal sensing tasks.

Motivation: AI正在从自动化常规任务扩展到认知劳动本身，对高学历白领工作产生不成比例的影响，传统数字或AI素养方法已不足够。需要新的框架来理解AI时代的人力能力需求。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) represents a qualitative shift in technological change by extending cognitive labor itself rather than merely automating routine tasks. Recent evidence shows that generative AI disproportionately affects highly educated, white collar work, challenging existing assumptions about workforce vulnerability and rendering traditional approaches to digital or AI literacy insufficient. This paper introduces the concept of AI Nativity, the capacity to integrate AI fluidly into everyday reasoning, problem solving, and decision making, and proposes the AI Pyramid, a conceptual framework for organizing human capability in an AI mediated economy. The framework distinguishes three interdependent capability layers: AI Native capability as a universal baseline for participation in AI augmented environments; AI Foundation capability for building, integrating, and sustaining AI enabled systems; and AI Deep capability for advancing frontier AI knowledge and applications. Crucially, the pyramid is not a career ladder but a system level distribution of capabilities required at scale. Building on this structure, the paper argues that effective AI workforce development requires treating capability formation as infrastructure rather than episodic training, centered on problem based learning embedded in work contexts and supported by dynamic skill ontologies and competency based measurement. The framework has implications for organizations, education systems, and governments seeking to align learning, measurement, and policy with the evolving demands of AI mediated work, while addressing productivity, resilience, and inequality at societal scale.

Method: DRAGON框架从初始全局解出发，自主识别高优化潜力区域，将大规模COPs分解为可管理的子问题，每个子问题重新表述为简洁的局部优化任务，通过目标导向的LLM提示在经验指导下求解，最后将局部优化解系统性地重新整合到全局上下文中。

Result: 在TSPLIB、CVRPLIB和Weibull-5k装箱基准测试中持续产生可行解，在超过300万变量的背包问题上达到接近最优的结果（0.16%差距）。

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了反馈驱动的语言智能体作为可泛化和可解释的大规模优化新范式的潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently shown promise in addressing combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) through prompt-based strategies. However, their scalability and generalization remain limited, and their effectiveness diminishes as problem size increases, particularly in routing problems involving more than 30 nodes. We propose DRAGON, which stands for Decomposition and Reconstruction Agents Guided OptimizatioN, a novel framework that combines the strengths of metaheuristic design and LLM reasoning. Starting from an initial global solution, DRAGON autonomously identifies regions with high optimization potential and strategically decompose large-scale COPs into manageable subproblems. Each subproblem is then reformulated as a concise, localized optimization task and solved through targeted LLM prompting guided by accumulated experiences. Finally, the locally optimized solutions are systematically reintegrated into the original global context to yield a significantly improved overall outcome. By continuously interacting with the optimization environment and leveraging an adaptive experience memory, the agents iteratively learn from feedback, effectively coupling symbolic reasoning with heuristic search. Empirical results show that, unlike existing LLM-based solvers limited to small-scale instances, DRAGON consistently produces feasible solutions on TSPLIB, CVRPLIB, and Weibull-5k bin packing benchmarks, and achieves near-optimal results (0.16% gap) on knapsack problems with over 3M variables. This work shows the potential of feedback-driven language agents as a new paradigm for generalizable and interpretable large-scale optimization.

Motivation: 现有的大型多模态模型主要针对短视频（几分钟内）进行评估，缺乏对长视频（几分钟到超过一小时）的理解能力，限制了在视频内容分析、感知理解等领域的应用。

Method: 采用后期融合策略，结合大型多模态模型、大型语言模型和语音识别模型构建QMAVIS管道，专门处理长视频音频内容的理解任务。

Conclusion: QMAVIS填补了长视频音频理解领域的空白，通过多模型融合策略显著提升了长视频理解性能，为视频内容分析、感知理解等应用开辟了新可能。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) for video-audio understanding have traditionally been evaluated only on shorter videos of a few minutes long. In this paper, we introduce QMAVIS (Q Team-Multimodal Audio Video Intelligent Sensemaking), a novel long video-audio understanding pipeline built through a late fusion of LMMs, Large Language Models, and speech recognition models. QMAVIS addresses the gap in long-form video analytics, particularly for longer videos of a few minutes to beyond an hour long, opening up new potential applica- tions in sensemaking, video content analysis, embodied AI, etc. Quantitative experiments using QMAVIS demonstrated a 38.75% improvement over state-of-the-art video-audio LMMs like Vide- oLlaMA2 and InternVL2 on the VideoMME (with subtitles) dataset, which comprises long videos with audio information. Evaluations on other challenging video understanding datasets like PerceptionTest and EgoSchema saw up to 2% improvement, indicating competitive performance. Qualitative experiments also showed that QMAVIS is able to extract the nuances of different scenes in a long video audio content while understanding the overarching narrative. Ablation studies were also conducted to ascertain the impact of each component in the fusion pipeline.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce ObjectZero, a novel reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm that leverages the power of object-level representations to model dynamic environments more effectively. Unlike traditional approaches that process the world as a single undifferentiated input, our method employs Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to capture intricate interactions among multiple objects. These objects, which can be manipulated and interact with each other, serve as the foundation for our model's understanding of the environment. We trained the algorithm in a complex setting teeming with diverse, interactive objects, demonstrating its ability to effectively learn and predict object dynamics. Our results highlight that a structured world model operating on object-centric representations can be successfully integrated into a model-based RL algorithm utilizing Monte Carlo Tree Search as a planning module.

Motivation: 6G网络需要自主编排机制将高层操作意图转化为可执行配置。现有基于意图的网络方法存在局限性：基于规则的系统难以处理语言变化，端到端神经模型缺乏可解释性且无法强制执行操作约束。

Method: 分层多智能体框架，使用基于LLM的智能体自主分解自然语言意图，咨询领域专家，通过迭代推理-行动(ReAct)循环合成技术上可行的网络切片配置。架构包含编排器智能体协调两个专家智能体（RAN和核心网），基于结构化网络状态表示进行ReAct式推理。

Conclusion: 该框架推进了下一代无线系统的自主编排能力，通过LLM智能体和结构化专家协作解决了现有IBN方法的局限性，为6G网络自动化提供了可行方案。

Abstract: The transition towards sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks necessitates autonomous orchestration mechanisms capable of translating high-level operational intents into executable network configurations. Existing approaches to Intent-Based Networking (IBN) rely upon either rule-based systems that struggle with linguistic variation or end-to-end neural models that lack interpretability and fail to enforce operational constraints. This paper presents a hierarchical multi-agent framework where Large Language Model (LLM) based agents autonomously decompose natural language intents, consult domain-specific specialists, and synthesise technically feasible network slice configurations through iterative reasoning-action (ReAct) cycles. The proposed architecture employs an orchestrator agent coordinating two specialist agents, i.e., Radio Access Network (RAN) and Core Network agents, via ReAct-style reasoning, grounded in structured network state representations. Experimental evaluation across diverse benchmark scenarios shows that the proposed system outperforms rule-based systems and direct LLM prompting, with architectural principles applicable to Open RAN (O-RAN) deployments. The results also demonstrate that whilst contemporary LLMs possess general telecommunications knowledge, network automation requires careful prompt engineering to encode context-dependent decision thresholds, advancing autonomous orchestration capabilities for next-generation wireless systems.

Abstract: Large language model-based agents are rapidly evolving from simple conversational assistants into autonomous systems capable of performing complex, professional-level tasks in various domains. While these advancements promise significant productivity gains, they also introduce critical safety risks that remain under-explored. Existing safety evaluations primarily focus on simple, daily assistance tasks, failing to capture the intricate decision-making processes and potential consequences of misaligned behaviors in professional settings. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{SafePro}, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the safety alignment of AI agents performing professional activities. SafePro features a dataset of high-complexity tasks across diverse professional domains with safety risks, developed through a rigorous iterative creation and review process. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art AI models reveals significant safety vulnerabilities and uncovers new unsafe behaviors in professional contexts. We further show that these models exhibit both insufficient safety judgment and weak safety alignment when executing complex professional tasks. In addition, we investigate safety mitigation strategies for improving agent safety in these scenarios and observe encouraging improvements. Together, our findings highlight the urgent need for robust safety mechanisms tailored to the next generation of professional AI agents.

Abstract: Evaluating Language Models (LMs) in specialized, high-stakes domains such as finance remains a significant challenge due to the scarcity of open, high-quality, and domain-specific datasets. Existing general-purpose benchmarks provide broad coverage but lack the depth and domain fidelity needed to assess LMs' capabilities for real-world financial reasoning, which requires both conceptual understanding and quantitative rigor. To address this gap, we introduce FinForge, a scalable, semi-synthetic pipeline for constructing finance-specific evaluation benchmarks through a hybrid of expert-guided data curation and controlled LM-based synthesis. FinForge combines manual and programmatic corpus construction from authoritative financial sources with structured question generation and validation using Gemini 2.5 Flash. To demonstrate the pipeline's efficacy, we produce FinForge-5k, a snapshot benchmark comprising over 5,000 human-validated question-answer pairs across 11 finance subdomains, derived from a curated corpus of 100,000 verified documents totaling 143M tokens. Evaluation of state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source models on FinForge-5k reveals significant differences in financial reasoning, with leading models achieving accuracy levels near 80%. These findings underscore the framework's utility for diagnosing current model limitations and guiding future improvements in financial domain competence.

Abstract: Process simulation is a critical cornerstone of chemical engineering design. Current automated chemical design methodologies focus mainly on various representations of process flow diagrams. However, transforming these diagrams into executable simulation flowsheets remains a time-consuming and labor-intensive endeavor, requiring extensive manual parameter configuration within simulation software. In this work, we propose a novel multi-agent workflow that leverages the semantic understanding capabilities of large language models(LLMs) and enables iterative interactions with chemical process simulation software, achieving end-to-end automated simulation from textual process specifications to computationally validated software configurations for design enhancement. Our approach integrates four specialized agents responsible for task understanding, topology generation, parameter configuration, and evaluation analysis, respectively, coupled with Enhanced Monte Carlo Tree Search to accurately interpret semantics and robustly generate configurations. Evaluated on Simona, a large-scale process description dataset, our method achieves a 31.1% improvement in the simulation convergence rate compared to state-of-the-art baselines and reduces the design time by 89. 0% compared to the expert manual design. This work demonstrates the potential of AI-assisted chemical process design, which bridges the gap between conceptual design and practical implementation. Our workflow is applicable to diverse process-oriented industries, including pharmaceuticals, petrochemicals, food processing, and manufacturing, offering a generalizable solution for automated process design.

TL;DR: ECHO是一个强化学习框架，通过同步协同进化循环联合优化策略和评论家，解决静态评论家无法适应策略演变的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于批评的强化学习方法依赖静态或离线评论家模型，这些模型无法适应策略的演变。在在线策略强化学习中，代理的错误模式会随时间变化，导致固定评论家变得过时，反馈效用递减。

Method: ECHO采用级联展开机制：评论家为初始轨迹生成多个诊断，然后进行策略细化以实现群体结构优势估计。通过饱和感知增益塑造目标解决学习平台问题，使用双轨GRPO更新确保评论家反馈与演化策略保持同步。

Result: 实验结果显示，ECHO在开放世界环境中实现了更稳定的训练和更高的长时程任务成功率。

Conclusion: 通过同步协同进化评论家和策略，ECHO解决了静态评论家在强化学习中的适应性问题，提高了训练稳定性和任务性能。

Abstract: Critique-guided reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for training LLM agents by augmenting sparse outcome rewards with natural-language feedback. However, current methods often rely on static or offline critic models, which fail to adapt as the policy evolves. In on-policy RL, the agent's error patterns shift over time, causing stationary critics to become stale and providing feedback of diminishing utility. To address this, we introduce ECHO (Evolving Critic for Hindsight-Guided Optimization)}, a framework that jointly optimizes the policy and critic through a synchronized co-evolutionary loop. ECHO utilizes a cascaded rollout mechanism where the critic generates multiple diagnoses for an initial trajectory, followed by policy refinement to enable group-structured advantage estimation. We address the challenge of learning plateaus via a saturation-aware gain shaping objective, which rewards the critic for inducing incremental improvements in high-performing trajectories. By employing dual-track GRPO updates, ECHO ensures the critic's feedback stays synchronized with the evolving policy. Experimental results show that ECHO yields more stable training and higher long-horizon task success across open-world environments.

TL;DR: 提出GDEPO方法解决ATP中GRPO算法的两个关键问题：复合奖励与验证器反馈冲突、静态采样导致数据浪费，通过动态额外采样、平等权利优势和动态额外迭代提升数据利用和优化效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自动定理证明中，GRPO算法面临两个关键问题：1）使用复合奖励时，相对优势估计可能与形式验证器的二元反馈冲突；2）静态采样策略如果找不到有效证明会丢弃整批数据，导致数据浪费和模型更新为零。

Method: 提出GDEPO方法，包含三个核心机制：1）动态额外采样：对无效批次重新采样直到发现有效证明；2）平等权利优势：将优势函数的符号（基于正确性）与幅度（由辅助奖励调节）解耦；3）动态额外迭代：对最初失败但最终成功的样本应用额外梯度步骤。

Result: 在三个不同难度数据集（MinF2F-test、MathOlympiadBench、PutnamBench）上的实验证实了GDEPO的有效性，消融研究验证了其协同组件的必要性。

Conclusion: GDEPO方法提高了数据利用率和优化效率，为ATP提供了一种新的训练范式，解决了GRPO在定理证明场景中的关键限制。

Abstract: Automated Theorem Proving (ATP) represents a fundamental challenge in Artificial Intelligence (AI), requiring the construction of machine-verifiable proofs in formal languages such as Lean to evaluate AI reasoning capabilities. Reinforcement learning (RL), particularly the high-performance Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm, has emerged as a mainstream approach for this task. However, in ATP scenarios, GRPO faces two critical issues: when composite rewards are used, its relative advantage estimation may conflict with the binary feedback from the formal verifier; meanwhile, its static sampling strategy may discard entire batches of data if no valid proof is found, resulting in zero contribution to model updates and significant data waste. To address these limitations, we propose Group Dual-dynamic and Equal-right-advantage Policy Optimization (GDEPO), a method incorporating three core mechanisms: 1) dynamic additional sampling, which resamples invalid batches until a valid proof is discovered; 2) equal-right advantage, decoupling the sign of the advantage function (based on correctness) from its magnitude (modulated by auxiliary rewards) to ensure stable and correct policy updates; and 3) dynamic additional iterations, applying extra gradient steps to initially failed but eventually successful samples to accelerate learning on challenging cases. Experiments conducted on three datasets of varying difficulty (MinF2F-test, MathOlympiadBench, PutnamBench) confirm the effectiveness of GDEPO, while ablation studies validate the necessity of its synergistic components. The proposed method enhances data utilization and optimization efficiency, offering a novel training paradigm for ATP.

TL;DR: 论文提出"Thinking with Deltas"框架，通过Differential Visual Reasoning Policy解决多模态RLVR中的感知-推理解耦问题，强制模型依赖视觉证据而非语言先验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于文本结果奖励的多模态RLVR方法存在感知-推理解耦问题：模型倾向于绕过视觉感知，仅依赖语言先验生成答案，成为"盲推理器"。实验表明即使完全移除视觉输入，最先进策略的性能仍能维持甚至提升。

Method: 提出Thinking with Deltas框架，核心是Differential Visual Reasoning Policy。该方法使用视觉三元组（原始、掩码、扰动输入），通过最大化与掩码输入的推理差异（强制视觉敏感性），同时最小化与扰动输入的推理差异（确保视觉鲁棒性），使推理变化严格与视觉信息变化对齐。

Result: DVRP显著提升了视觉理解能力，在通用和医学基准测试中都优于最先进方法，且不需要外部标注或辅助工具。

Conclusion: 通过强制模型推理变化与视觉信息变化对齐，DVRP有效解决了多模态RLVR中的感知-推理解耦问题，使模型真正依赖视觉证据进行推理。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has significantly advanced reasoning capabilities in Large Language Models. However, adapting RLVR to multimodal domains suffers from a critical \textit{perception-reasoning decoupling}. Existing paradigms, driven by text-centric outcome rewards, reasoning in language medium, inadvertently encourage models to bypass visual perception. We empirically validate this through blind experiments: state-of-the-art policies maintain or surprisingly improve performance even when visual inputs are entirely removed. This reveals that these models degenerate into \textit{blind reasoners}, exploiting linguistic priors to generate plausible answers instead of attending to visual evidence. In response, we propose \textbf{Thinking with Deltas}, a framework driven by a \textbf{Differential Visual Reasoning Policy (DVRP)}. DVRP introduces intrinsic supervision via visual triplets, comprising original, masked, and perturbed inputs. It optimizes the model to maximize reasoning divergence from masked inputs (enforcing \textit{visual sensitivity}) while minimizing divergence from perturbed inputs (ensuring \textit{visual robustness}). By aligning reasoning variations strictly with the \textit{Delta} of visual information, DVRP inherently bolsters visual understanding capabilities and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both general and medical benchmarks, without requiring external annotations or auxiliary tools.

Motivation: 现有的检索增强生成（RAG）系统存在幻觉、过度信任噪声片段或忽略关键上下文的问题，需要使决策过程更透明可控。

Method: TCR框架包含三个核心组件：1）双对比编码器分离语义匹配和事实一致性；2）估计自我可答性来评估内部记忆置信度；3）通过SNR加权的轻量级软提示将三个标量信号传递给生成器。

Result: 在七个基准测试中，TCR将冲突检测提高了5-18个F1分数，知识缺口恢复提高了21.4个百分点，误导上下文覆盖减少了29.3个百分点，仅增加0.3%的参数。信号与人类判断一致并揭示了时间决策模式。

Conclusion: TCR通过使RAG决策过程透明可控，有效解决了幻觉、过度信任噪声和忽略上下文的问题，显著提升了系统性能，同时保持了参数效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) equipped with retrieval--the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) paradigm--should combine their parametric knowledge with external evidence, yet in practice they often hallucinate, over-trust noisy snippets, or ignore vital context. We introduce TCR (Transparent Conflict Resolution), a plug-and-play framework that makes this decision process observable and controllable. TCR (i) disentangles semantic match and factual consistency via dual contrastive encoders, (ii) estimates self-answerability to gauge confidence in internal memory, and (iii) feeds the three scalar signals to the generator through a lightweight soft-prompt with SNR-based weighting. Across seven benchmarks TCR improves conflict detection (+5-18 F1), raises knowledge-gap recovery by +21.4 pp and cuts misleading-context overrides by -29.3 pp, while adding only 0.3% parameters. The signals align with human judgements and expose temporal decision patterns.

Abstract: Designing effective control policies for autonomous systems remains a fundamental challenge, traditionally addressed through reinforcement learning or manual engineering. While reinforcement learning has achieved remarkable success, it often suffers from high sample complexity, reward shaping difficulties, and produces opaque neural network policies that are hard to interpret or verify. Manual design, on the other hand, requires substantial domain expertise and struggles to scale across diverse tasks. In this work, we demonstrate that LLM-driven evolutionary search can effectively synthesize interpretable control policies in the form of executable code. By treating policy synthesis as a code evolution problem, we harness the LLM's prior knowledge of programming patterns and control heuristics while employing evolutionary search to explore the solution space systematically. We implement our approach using EvoToolkit, a framework that seamlessly integrates LLM-driven evolution with customizable fitness evaluation. Our method iteratively evolves populations of candidate policy programs, evaluating them against task-specific objectives and selecting superior individuals for reproduction. This process yields compact, human-readable control policies that can be directly inspected, modified, and formally verified. This work highlights the potential of combining foundation models with evolutionary computation for synthesizing trustworthy control policies in autonomous systems.

Motivation: 通过比较生物系统和人工智能系统中智能的独立演化，识别智能的基本计算原理。研究大型语言模型是否自发形成类似人脑的协同信息处理结构。

Method: 使用信息分解原理分析多个LLM模型家族和架构，识别模型中的协同处理区域。通过消融实验测试协同组件的重要性，并通过强化学习和监督微调比较不同组件的训练效果。

Result: 发现LLM中间层表现出协同处理，而早期和晚期层依赖冗余，这与生物大脑的信息组织方式相似。消融协同组件会导致不成比例的行为变化和性能损失。通过强化学习微调协同区域比训练冗余组件获得更大的性能提升，但监督微调没有这种优势。

Conclusion: 协同信息处理是智能的基本属性，为原则性模型设计提供了目标，并为生物智能提供了可检验的预测。这种收敛表明智能系统在演化中自发形成相似的信息处理结构。

Abstract: The independent evolution of intelligence in biological and artificial systems offers a unique opportunity to identify its fundamental computational principles. Here we show that large language models spontaneously develop synergistic cores -- components where information integration exceeds individual parts -- remarkably similar to those in the human brain. Using principles of information decomposition across multiple LLM model families and architectures, we find that areas in middle layers exhibit synergistic processing while early and late layers rely on redundancy, mirroring the informational organisation in biological brains. This organisation emerges through learning and is absent in randomly initialised networks. Crucially, ablating synergistic components causes disproportionate behavioural changes and performance loss, aligning with theoretical predictions about the fragility of synergy. Moreover, fine-tuning synergistic regions through reinforcement learning yields significantly greater performance gains than training redundant components, yet supervised fine-tuning shows no such advantage. This convergence suggests that synergistic information processing is a fundamental property of intelligence, providing targets for principled model design and testable predictions for biological intelligence.

Motivation: 现有LLM代理训练框架主要关注答案准确性，忽视了行为模式的特定对齐，导致代理在执行TIR任务时表现出无效行为（如冗余和不足的工具调用）。如何校准这些错误行为模式并探索有效轨迹是一个开放性问题。

Method: 提出ET-Agent框架，包含两个协同视角：1）自我进化数据飞轮生成增强数据，用于微调LLM以提升探索能力；2）两阶段行为校准训练框架，逐步将错误行为模式校准为最优行为。

Result: 深入实验证实ET-Agent在多个维度上的优越性，包括正确性、效率、推理简洁性和工具执行准确性。

Conclusion: ET-Agent框架为TIR领域研究提供了实用见解，能够有效校准代理的工具使用行为。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can extend their parameter knowledge limits by adopting the Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) paradigm. However, existing LLM-based agent training framework often focuses on answers' accuracy, overlooking specific alignment for behavior patterns. Consequently, agent often exhibits ineffective actions during TIR tasks, such as redundant and insufficient tool calls. How to calibrate erroneous behavioral patterns when executing TIR tasks, thereby exploring effective trajectories, remains an open-ended problem. In this paper, we propose ET-Agent, a training framework for calibrating agent's tool-use behavior through two synergistic perspectives: Self-evolving Data Flywheel and Behavior Calibration Training. Specifically, we introduce a self-evolutionary data flywheel to generate enhanced data, used to fine-tune LLM to improve its exploration ability. Based on this, we implement an two-phases behavior-calibration training framework. It is designed to progressively calibrate erroneous behavioral patterns to optimal behaviors. Further in-depth experiments confirm the superiority of \ourmodel{} across multiple dimensions, including correctness, efficiency, reasoning conciseness, and tool execution accuracy. Our ET-Agent framework provides practical insights for research in the TIR field. Codes can be found in https://github.com/asilverlight/ET-Agent

TL;DR: 开发了一个结合认知行为疗法和非洲Ubuntu哲学的AI心理健康对话系统，通过文化适应提升在非洲语境下的适用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 南非日益严重的心理健康危机，加上缺乏文化响应性护理，需要创新的、基于当地语境的干预措施。虽然大语言模型在心理健康支持方面有潜力，但其以西方为中心的训练数据限制了在非洲语境中的文化和语言适用性。

Method: 采用设计科学研究方法，开发了一个概念验证框架，将认知行为疗法与非洲Ubuntu哲学结合。通过深度理论和治疗适应以及表层语言和沟通文化适应，重新诠释CBT技术（如行为激活和认知重构）。通过语言简化、精神语境化和Ubuntu重构的迭代过程开发文化适应数据集，使用专家知情案例研究评估模型。

Result: 模型能够进行富有同理心、情境感知的对话，符合治疗和文化目标。虽然尚未进行实时终端用户测试，但模型经过领域专家临床心理学家的严格审查和监督，显示出文化嵌入的情感智能能增强AI驱动心理健康干预在非洲环境中的情境相关性、包容性和有效性。

Conclusion: 研究表明，将Ubuntu哲学与认知行为疗法结合的文化适应AI系统，有潜力为非洲语境提供更相关、包容和有效的心理健康支持，为文化敏感的心理健康AI干预提供了新方向。

Abstract: South Africa's escalating mental health crisis, compounded by limited access to culturally responsive care, calls for innovative and contextually grounded interventions. While large language models show considerable promise for mental health support, their predominantly Western-centric training data limit cultural and linguistic applicability in African contexts. This study introduces a proof-of-concept framework that integrates cognitive behavioral therapy with the African philosophy of Ubuntu to create a culturally sensitive, emotionally intelligent, AI-driven mental health dialogue system. Guided by a design science research methodology, the framework applies both deep theoretical and therapeutic adaptations as well as surface-level linguistic and communicative cultural adaptations. Key CBT techniques, including behavioral activation and cognitive restructuring, were reinterpreted through Ubuntu principles that emphasize communal well-being, spiritual grounding, and interconnectedness. A culturally adapted dataset was developed through iterative processes of language simplification, spiritual contextualization, and Ubuntu-based reframing. The fine-tuned model was evaluated through expert-informed case studies, employing UniEval for conversational quality assessment alongside additional measures of CBT reliability and cultural linguistic alignment. Results demonstrate that the model effectively engages in empathetic, context-aware dialogue aligned with both therapeutic and cultural objectives. Although real-time end-user testing has not yet been conducted, the model underwent rigorous review and supervision by domain specialist clinical psychologists. The findings highlight the potential of culturally embedded emotional intelligence to enhance the contextual relevance, inclusivity, and effectiveness of AI-driven mental health interventions across African settings.

TL;DR: V2P方法通过抑制注意力机制和基于Fitts定律的高斯热图建模，解决GUI元素定位中的背景干扰和中心边缘区分问题，显著提升定位精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GUI元素定位方法依赖边界框或中心点回归，忽略了空间交互不确定性和视觉语义层次。现有注意力方法存在两个关键问题：1) 忽略背景区域处理导致注意力漂移；2) 均匀建模目标UI元素无法区分中心和边缘，导致点击不精确。

Method: 提出Valley-to-Peak (V2P)方法：1) 引入抑制注意力机制，最小化模型对无关区域的关注以突出目标区域；2) 采用Fitts定律启发的方法，将GUI交互建模为2D高斯热图，权重从中心向边缘逐渐减小，方差由目标大小决定。

Result: 在ScreenSpot-v2和ScreenSpot-Pro两个基准测试上分别达到92.4%和52.5%的性能。消融实验证实了各组件贡献，展示了V2P在精确GUI定位任务中的泛化能力。

Conclusion: V2P方法有效隔离目标区域并教导模型关注UI元素最关键的点，在精确GUI定位任务中表现出色，具有实际部署潜力。

Abstract: Precise localization of GUI elements is crucial for the development of GUI agents. Traditional methods rely on bounding box or center-point regression, neglecting spatial interaction uncertainty and visual-semantic hierarchies. Recent methods incorporate attention mechanisms but still face two key issues: (1) ignoring processing background regions causes attention drift from the desired area, and (2) uniform modeling the target UI element fails to distinguish between its center and edges, leading to click imprecision. Inspired by how humans visually process and interact with GUI elements, we propose the Valley-to-Peak (V2P) method to address these issues. To mitigate background distractions, V2P introduces a suppression attention mechanism that minimizes the model's focus on irrelevant regions to highlight the intended region. For the issue of center-edge distinction, V2P applies a Fitts' Law-inspired approach by modeling GUI interactions as 2D Gaussian heatmaps where the weight gradually decreases from the center towards the edges. The weight distribution follows a Gaussian function, with the variance determined by the target's size. Consequently, V2P effectively isolates the target area and teaches the model to concentrate on the most essential point of the UI element. The model trained by V2P achieves the performance with 92.4\% and 52.5\% on two benchmarks ScreenSpot-v2 and ScreenSpot-Pro (see Fig.~\ref{fig:main_results_charts}). Ablations further confirm each component's contribution, underscoring V2P's generalizability in precise GUI grounding tasks and its potential for real-world deployment in future GUI agents.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based systems increasingly rely on function calling to enable structured and controllable interaction with external data sources, yet existing datasets do not address mental health-oriented access to wearable sensor data. This paper presents a synthetic function-calling dataset designed for mental health assistance grounded in wearable health signals such as sleep, physical activity, cardiovascular measures, stress indicators, and metabolic data. The dataset maps diverse natural language queries to standardized API calls derived from a widely adopted health data schema. Each sample includes a user query, a query category, an explicit reasoning step, a normalized temporal parameter, and a target function. The dataset covers explicit, implicit, behavioral, symptom-based, and metaphorical expressions, which reflect realistic mental health-related user interactions. This resource supports research on intent grounding, temporal reasoning, and reliable function invocation in LLM-based mental health agents and is publicly released to promote reproducibility and future work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM越来越多地集成到人机协同内容审核系统中，核心挑战在于判断何时可以信任AI输出、何时需要人工审核，需要可靠的不确定性量化方法来优化人机协作流程

Method: 提出监督式LLM不确定性量化框架，学习基于LLM输出特征(对数概率、熵、新型不确定性归因指标)构建的元模型LLM性能预测器(LPPs)，用于成本感知的选择性分类

Result: 在多种先进LLM(包括商业模型Gemini、GPT和开源模型Llama、Qwen)上，在多模态和多语言审核任务中，相比现有不确定性估计器在准确率-成本权衡方面取得显著改进

Conclusion: 建立了不确定性感知、可扩展且负责任的人机协同审核工作流程的原则性框架，LPPs不仅提升不确定性估计，还通过提供对失败条件的新见解增强可解释性

Abstract: As LLMs are increasingly integrated into human-in-the-loop content moderation systems, a central challenge is deciding when their outputs can be trusted versus when escalation for human review is preferable. We propose a novel framework for supervised LLM uncertainty quantification, learning a dedicated meta-model based on LLM Performance Predictors (LPPs) derived from LLM outputs: log-probabilities, entropy, and novel uncertainty attribution indicators. We demonstrate that our method enables cost-aware selective classification in real-world human-AI workflows: escalating high-risk cases while automating the rest. Experiments across state-of-the-art LLMs, including both off-the-shelf (Gemini, GPT) and open-source (Llama, Qwen), on multimodal and multilingual moderation tasks, show significant improvements over existing uncertainty estimators in accuracy-cost trade-offs. Beyond uncertainty estimation, the LPPs enhance explainability by providing new insights into failure conditions (e.g., ambiguous content vs. under-specified policy). This work establishes a principled framework for uncertainty-aware, scalable, and responsible human-AI moderation workflows.

Motivation: AI克隆需要模拟个体的思维和行为以实现长期个性化交互，这对记忆系统提出了严格要求。现有记忆基准主要依赖用户-代理对话历史，这些数据在时间上是碎片化的，不足以捕捉连续的生命轨迹。

Method: 引入CloneMem基准，基于非对话数字痕迹（日记、社交媒体帖子、邮件）构建，时间跨度1-3年。采用分层数据构建框架确保纵向连贯性，并定义评估代理追踪个人状态演变能力的任务。

Result: 实验表明，当前的记忆机制在这种设置下表现困难，突显了基于生命轨迹的个性化AI面临的开放挑战。

Conclusion: CloneMem基准为评估AI克隆的长期记忆能力提供了新框架，揭示了现有记忆机制在捕捉连续生命轨迹方面的不足，为未来研究指明了方向。

Abstract: AI Clones aim to simulate an individual's thoughts and behaviors to enable long-term, personalized interaction, placing stringent demands on memory systems to model experiences, emotions, and opinions over time. Existing memory benchmarks primarily rely on user-agent conversational histories, which are temporally fragmented and insufficient for capturing continuous life trajectories. We introduce CloneMem, a benchmark for evaluating longterm memory in AI Clone scenarios grounded in non-conversational digital traces, including diaries, social media posts, and emails, spanning one to three years. CloneMem adopts a hierarchical data construction framework to ensure longitudinal coherence and defines tasks that assess an agent's ability to track evolving personal states. Experiments show that current memory mechanisms struggle in this setting, highlighting open challenges for life-grounded personalized AI.

TL;DR: Dr. Zero 是一个无需训练数据的搜索代理自进化框架，通过提议者-求解者的反馈循环和分组相对策略优化，实现了复杂推理和搜索能力的自主进化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高质量数据获取日益困难，传统多轮搜索代理在无数据自进化中面临问题多样性有限和计算成本高的挑战，需要一种无需训练数据的高效自进化方法。

Method: 设计了自进化反馈循环：提议者生成多样化问题训练求解者，求解者进化后激励提议者产生更难但可解的任务，形成自动化课程。引入跳转分组相对策略优化（HRPO），将结构相似问题聚类构建组级基线，减少采样开销。

Result: 实验结果表明，无数据的 Dr. Zero 能够匹配甚至超越完全监督的搜索代理，证明复杂推理和搜索能力可以通过纯自进化实现。

Conclusion: Dr. Zero 框架成功实现了无需训练数据的搜索代理自进化，通过自动化课程和高效训练方法，为解决高质量数据稀缺问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: As high-quality data becomes increasingly difficult to obtain, data-free self-evolution has emerged as a promising paradigm. This approach allows large language models (LLMs) to autonomously generate and solve complex problems, thereby improving their reasoning capabilities. However, multi-turn search agents struggle in data-free self-evolution due to the limited question diversity and the substantial compute required for multi-step reasoning and tool using. In this work, we introduce Dr. Zero, a framework enabling search agents to effectively self-evolve without any training data. In particular, we design a self-evolution feedback loop where a proposer generates diverse questions to train a solver initialized from the same base model. As the solver evolves, it incentivizes the proposer to produce increasingly difficult yet solvable tasks, thus establishing an automated curriculum to refine both agents. To enhance training efficiency, we also introduce hop-grouped relative policy optimization (HRPO). This method clusters structurally similar questions to construct group-level baselines, effectively minimizing the sampling overhead in evaluating each query's individual difficulty and solvability. Consequently, HRPO significantly reduces the compute requirements for solver training without compromising performance or stability. Extensive experiment results demonstrate that the data-free Dr. Zero matches or surpasses fully supervised search agents, proving that complex reasoning and search capabilities can emerge solely through self-evolution.

Motivation: 传统概念地图自动构建面临两大挑战：1）缺乏为多层次教学目的（从低阶到高阶思维）设计的学科概念；2）关于学科概念及其相互关系的标记数据有限。需要新的方法来解决这些问题。

Method: 引入领域问题地图（DQMs）的创新方法，通过制定与学习目标对齐的具体问题来构建，而不是传统的概念地图。该方法能够有效生成教育问题并识别问题间的层次关系。

Abstract: Concept maps have been widely utilized in education to depict knowledge structures and the interconnections between disciplinary concepts. Nonetheless, devising a computational method for automatically constructing a concept map from unstructured educational materials presents challenges due to the complexity and variability of educational content. We focus primarily on two challenges: (1) the lack of disciplinary concepts that are specifically designed for multi-level pedagogical purposes from low-order to high-order thinking, and (2) the limited availability of labeled data concerning disciplinary concepts and their interrelationships. To tackle these challenges, this research introduces an innovative approach for constructing Domain Question Maps (DQMs), rather than traditional concept maps. By formulating specific questions aligned with learning objectives, DQMs enhance knowledge representation and improve readiness for learner engagement. The findings indicate that the proposed method can effectively generate educational questions and discern hierarchical relationships among them, leading to structured question maps that facilitate personalized and adaptive learning in downstream applications.

TL;DR: ENTRA：基于熵的训练框架，通过双向重要性估计和强化学习减少大推理模型中的冗余推理，在保持准确性的同时显著缩短输出长度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）存在"过度思考"问题，即使处理简单任务也会生成过长的推理链，导致计算开销大但性能提升有限。现有方法通常限制输出长度或优化正确性，这种粗粒度监督无法引导模型进行简洁而准确的推理。

Method: 提出ENTRA框架：1）使用轻量级双向重要性估计（BIE）方法评估token级别的重要性，综合考虑预测置信度和前向影响；2）基于低重要性token的熵计算冗余奖励，并进行归一化处理；3）通过强化学习优化该奖励。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中，ENTRA将输出长度减少了37%到53%，同时没有损失准确性，在某些情况下甚至提高了准确性。

Conclusion: ENTRA为减少LRMs中的过度思考提供了原则性和高效的解决方案，并为冗余感知的推理优化提供了可推广的路径。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) often suffer from overthinking, generating unnecessarily long reasoning chains even for simple tasks. This leads to substantial computational overhead with limited performance gain, primarily due to redundant verification and repetitive generation. While prior work typically constrains output length or optimizes correctness, such coarse supervision fails to guide models toward concise yet accurate inference. In this paper, we propose ENTRA, an entropy-based training framework that suppresses redundant reasoning while preserving performance. ENTRA first estimates the token-level importance using a lightweight Bidirectional Importance Estimation (BIE) method, which accounts for both prediction confidence and forward influence. It then computes a redundancy reward based on the entropy of low-importance tokens, normalized by its theoretical upper bound, and optimizes this reward via reinforcement learning. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that ENTRA reduces output length by 37% to 53% with no loss-and in some cases, gains-in accuracy. Our approach offers a principled and efficient solution to reduce overthinking in LRMs, and provides a generalizable path toward redundancy-aware reasoning optimization.

Motivation: 尽管大语言模型能生成流畅文本，但生成高质量创造性故事仍具挑战性。强化学习虽有望解决此问题，但面临两个关键障碍：为主观故事质量设计可靠奖励信号，以及缓解训练不稳定性。

Method: 1. 开发生成式奖励模型(GenRM)，通过监督微调从强教师模型蒸馏推理链的演示，并在扩展偏好数据上进行GRPO优化，提供多维度故事偏好分析和显式推理。2. 引入基于熵的奖励塑造策略，动态优先学习自信错误和不确定的正确预测，防止对已掌握模式的过拟合。

Result: GenRM在人类创造力判断上达到68%对齐率，RLCS框架在整体故事质量上显著优于包括Gemini-2.5-Pro在内的强基线模型。

Conclusion: 该工作为将强化学习应用于创造性领域提供了实用流程，有效解决了奖励建模和训练稳定性的双重挑战。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate fluent text, producing high-quality creative stories remains challenging. Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising solution but faces two critical obstacles: designing reliable reward signals for subjective storytelling quality and mitigating training instability. This paper introduces the Reinforcement Learning for Creative Storytelling (RLCS) framework to systematically address both challenges. First, we develop a Generative Reward Model (GenRM) that provides multi-dimensional analysis and explicit reasoning about story preferences, trained through supervised fine-tuning on demonstrations with reasoning chains distilled from strong teacher models, followed by GRPO-based refinement on expanded preference data. Second, we introduce an entropy-based reward shaping strategy that dynamically prioritizes learning on confident errors and uncertain correct predictions, preventing overfitting on already-mastered patterns. Experiments demonstrate that GenRM achieves 68\% alignment with human creativity judgments, and RLCS significantly outperforms strong baselines including Gemini-2.5-Pro in overall story quality. This work provides a practical pipeline for applying RL to creative domains, effectively navigating the dual challenges of reward modeling and training stability.

Motivation: NPU需要高性能内核代码，但使用厂商特定DSL开发困难，需要深厚硬件知识且耗时。通用LLM在NPU领域因严格约束和训练数据稀缺而表现不佳，复杂内核生成成功率几乎为零。

Method: 提出AscendKernelGen框架：1) 创建Ascend-CoT数据集，包含真实内核实现的思维链推理；2) 开发KernelGen-LM模型，通过监督微调和带执行反馈的强化学习进行领域自适应训练；3) 设计NPUKernelBench基准，评估编译、正确性和性能。

Conclusion: 领域特定推理和严格评估在自动化加速器感知代码生成中起关键作用，AscendKernelGen框架有效解决了NPU内核开发的挑战。

Abstract: To meet the ever-increasing demand for computational efficiency, Neural Processing Units (NPUs) have become critical in modern AI infrastructure. However, unlocking their full potential requires developing high-performance compute kernels using vendor-specific Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs), a task that demands deep hardware expertise and is labor-intensive. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in general code generation, they struggle with the strict constraints and scarcity of training data in the NPU domain. Our preliminary study reveals that state-of-the-art general-purpose LLMs fail to generate functional complex kernels for Ascend NPUs, yielding a near-zero success rate. To address these challenges, we propose AscendKernelGen, a generation-evaluation integrated framework for NPU kernel development. We introduce Ascend-CoT, a high-quality dataset incorporating chain-of-thought reasoning derived from real-world kernel implementations, and KernelGen-LM, a domain-adaptive model trained via supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning with execution feedback. Furthermore, we design NPUKernelBench, a comprehensive benchmark for assessing compilation, correctness, and performance across varying complexity levels. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly bridges the gap between general LLMs and hardware-specific coding. Specifically, the compilation success rate on complex Level-2 kernels improves from 0% to 95.5% (Pass@10), while functional correctness achieves 64.3% compared to the baseline's complete failure. These results highlight the critical role of domain-specific reasoning and rigorous evaluation in automating accelerator-aware code generation.

TL;DR: Focus提出了一种基于黏菌探索策略的LLM代理架构，通过自主决定何时压缩历史记录来减少上下文膨胀，在保持相同准确率的情况下实现22.7%的token节省。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM代理在处理长时程软件工程任务时面临"上下文膨胀"问题：随着交互历史增长，计算成本激增、延迟增加，且推理能力因无关历史错误而下降。现有解决方案通常依赖被动的外部摘要机制，代理无法控制。

Method: 提出Focus架构，受黏菌生物探索策略启发。代理自主决定何时将关键学习内容整合到持久的"知识"块中，并主动修剪原始交互历史。使用优化的脚手架（持久bash + 字符串替换编辑器）匹配行业最佳实践。

Result: 在SWE-bench Lite的5个上下文密集型实例上使用Claude Haiku 4.5评估。通过鼓励频繁压缩的积极提示，实现22.7%的token减少（1490万→1150万），同时保持相同准确率（3/5=60%）。每个任务平均执行6.0次自主压缩，单个实例token节省最高达57%。

Conclusion: 研究表明，当配备适当工具和提示时，有能力的模型可以自主调节其上下文，为不牺牲任务性能的成本感知代理系统开辟了途径。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents struggle with long-horizon software engineering tasks due to "Context Bloat." As interaction history grows, computational costs explode, latency increases, and reasoning capabilities degrade due to distraction by irrelevant past errors. Existing solutions often rely on passive, external summarization mechanisms that the agent cannot control. This paper proposes Focus, an agent-centric architecture inspired by the biological exploration strategies of Physarum polycephalum (slime mold). The Focus Agent autonomously decides when to consolidate key learnings into a persistent "Knowledge" block and actively withdraws (prunes) the raw interaction history. Using an optimized scaffold matching industry best practices (persistent bash + string-replacement editor), we evaluated Focus on N=5 context-intensive instances from SWE-bench Lite using Claude Haiku 4.5. With aggressive prompting that encourages frequent compression, Focus achieves 22.7% token reduction (14.9M -> 11.5M tokens) while maintaining identical accuracy (3/5 = 60% for both agents). Focus performed 6.0 autonomous compressions per task on average, with token savings up to 57% on individual instances. We demonstrate that capable models can autonomously self-regulate their context when given appropriate tools and prompting, opening pathways for cost-aware agentic systems without sacrificing task performance.

Motivation: 当前LLM路由领域缺乏统一的大规模基准测试框架，不同方法评估标准不一，难以系统比较。需要建立标准化评估体系来重新评估路由方法的真实效果。

Method: 构建LLMRouterBench基准，包含400K+实例、21个数据集、33个模型，集成10种代表性路由基线，提供性能导向和性能-成本权衡的全面评估指标。

Result: 1) 确认模型互补性存在；2) 多数路由方法在统一评估下表现相似；3) 多个近期方法（包括商业路由器）未能稳定超越简单基线；4) 与Oracle仍有显著差距，主要由模型召回失败导致；5) 骨干嵌入模型影响有限；6) 大模型集成收益递减，精心筛选更重要；7) 支持延迟感知分析。

Conclusion: LLM路由领域需要更统一的评估标准，当前方法仍有改进空间，模型筛选比简单增加集成规模更重要，基准为未来研究提供了标准化测试平台。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) routing assigns each query to the most suitable model from an ensemble. We introduce LLMRouterBench, a large-scale benchmark and unified framework for LLM routing. It comprises over 400K instances from 21 datasets and 33 models. Moreover, it provides comprehensive metrics for both performance-oriented routing and performance-cost trade-off routing, and integrates 10 representative routing baselines. Using LLMRouterBench, we systematically re-evaluate the field. While confirming strong model complementarity-the central premise of LLM routing-we find that many routing methods exhibit similar performance under unified evaluation, and several recent approaches, including commercial routers, fail to reliably outperform a simple baseline. Meanwhile, a substantial gap remains to the Oracle, driven primarily by persistent model-recall failures. We further show that backbone embedding models have limited impact, that larger ensembles exhibit diminishing returns compared to careful model curation, and that the benchmark also enables latency-aware analysis.

TL;DR: PRISM框架基于模式理论，通过分析梯度空间几何结构来仲裁SFT和RL阶段的数据分配，根据数据与模型现有知识的认知冲突程度进行路由，实现帕累托改进并降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前混合监督微调（SFT）和强化学习（RL）的数据分配策略主要依赖表层启发式方法，无法诊断内在学习需求。由于SFT通过模仿进行模式巩固，而RL通过探索驱动结构适应，数据与这些功能角色的错配会导致严重的优化干扰。

Method: 提出PRISM框架，基于模式理论，通过分析梯度空间几何结构来仲裁数据分配。识别触发高空间集中度的梯度数据作为高冲突信号，需要RL进行结构重组；而产生扩散更新的数据则路由到SFT进行高效巩固。

Result: 在WebShop和ALFWorld上的广泛实验表明，PRISM实现了帕累托改进，优于最先进的混合方法，同时将计算成本降低了高达3.22倍。

Conclusion: 基于内部优化机制解耦数据对于可扩展和鲁棒的智能体对齐至关重要。PRISM框架通过认知冲突感知的数据仲裁，有效解决了SFT和RL阶段的优化干扰问题。

Abstract: While Hybrid Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become the standard paradigm for training LLM agents, effective mechanisms for data allocation between these stages remain largely underexplored. Current data arbitration strategies often rely on surface-level heuristics that fail to diagnose intrinsic learning needs. Since SFT targets pattern consolidation through imitation while RL drives structural adaptation via exploration, misaligning data with these functional roles causes severe optimization interference. We propose PRISM, a dynamics-aware framework grounded in Schema Theory that arbitrates data based on its degree of cognitive conflict with the model's existing knowledge. By analyzing the spatial geometric structure of gradients, PRISM identifies data triggering high spatial concentration as high-conflict signals that require RL for structural restructuring. In contrast, data yielding diffuse updates is routed to SFT for efficient consolidation. Extensive experiments on WebShop and ALFWorld demonstrate that PRISM achieves a Pareto improvement, outperforming state-of-the-art hybrid methods while reducing computational costs by up to 3.22$\times$. Our findings suggest that disentangling data based on internal optimization regimes is crucial for scalable and robust agent alignment.

TL;DR: NoisyBench是一个评估AI模型在噪声环境中鲁棒性的基准测试，涵盖RAG、推理、对齐和工具使用等任务，发现当前最先进模型在噪声干扰下性能下降高达80%，并提出了Rationale-Aware Reward方法来提升模型抗噪能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI模型越来越依赖外部信息，但现实世界的信息环境充满噪声，而现有的基准测试过于理想化，无法反映模型在真实噪声环境中的表现。需要建立一个系统性的基准来评估模型在噪声干扰下的鲁棒性。

Method: 提出了NoisyBench基准，包含11个数据集，覆盖RAG、推理、对齐和工具使用四大任务类型，引入多种噪声类型（随机文档、无关聊天历史、困难负样本等）。评估了多种现有方法（提示工程、上下文工程、SFT、基于结果的RL），并提出了Rationale-Aware Reward (RARE)方法，通过激励模型识别噪声中的有用信息来增强鲁棒性。

Result: 发现最先进模型在噪声干扰下性能下降高达80%；智能体工作流会放大错误（过度信任噪声工具输出）；噪声会引发突发性不对齐问题；现有方法（提示、上下文工程、SFT、基于结果的RL）都无法确保鲁棒性；RARE方法显著提升了抗噪能力；还发现测试时计算量增加反而导致性能下降的逆缩放趋势，注意力可视化显示模型过度关注噪声标记。

Conclusion: 噪声对AI模型性能有灾难性影响，现有方法不足以应对噪声挑战。RARE方法通过激励识别有用信息有效提升了鲁棒性。研究揭示了模型在噪声环境中的脆弱性，为构建下一代鲁棒推理智能体提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning models and agentic AI systems have led to an increased reliance on diverse external information. However, this shift introduces input contexts that are inherently noisy, a reality that current sanitized benchmarks fail to capture. We introduce NoisyBench, a comprehensive benchmark that systematically evaluates model robustness across 11 datasets in RAG, reasoning, alignment, and tool-use tasks against diverse noise types, including random documents, irrelevant chat histories, and hard negative distractors. Our evaluation reveals a catastrophic performance drop of up to 80% in state-of-the-art models when faced with contextual distractors. Crucially, we find that agentic workflows often amplify these errors by over-trusting noisy tool outputs, and distractors can trigger emergent misalignment even without adversarial intent. We find that prompting, context engineering, SFT, and outcome-reward only RL fail to ensure robustness; in contrast, our proposed Rationale-Aware Reward (RARE) significantly strengthens resilience by incentivizing the identification of helpful information within noise. Finally, we uncover an inverse scaling trend where increased test-time computation leads to worse performance in noisy settings and demonstrate via attention visualization that models disproportionately focus on distractor tokens, providing vital insights for building the next generation of robust, reasoning-capable agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FLoReNce是一个基于反馈推理的智能体框架，通过闭环学习和开环推理来提升幽默梗图的理解能力，利用反馈知识库在推理时调整提示，无需微调即可改善预测性能和解释质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态或基于提示的模型在解释幽默时采用开环方式，一旦做出预测就缺乏批判或精炼推理的能力。幽默梗图融合视觉和文本线索传达讽刺或社会评论，需要AI系统理解意图而非表面关联。

Method: 提出FLoReNce框架：学习阶段采用闭环过程，推理智能体由评判者批判，将错误和语义反馈转化为控制信号存储在反馈知识库中；推理阶段采用开环过程，从知识库检索相似评判经验来调整提示，实现更好的自对齐推理。

Result: 在PrideMM数据集上，FLoReNce在预测性能和解释质量上都优于静态多模态基线模型，表明反馈调节的提示方法是实现自适应幽默梗图理解的有效途径。

Conclusion: 反馈调节的提示方法是实现自适应幽默梗图理解的可行路径，通过闭环学习和反馈知识库的检索机制，能够在不进行微调的情况下提升模型的推理能力。

Abstract: Humorous memes blend visual and textual cues to convey irony, satire, or social commentary, posing unique challenges for AI systems that must interpret intent rather than surface correlations. Existing multimodal or prompting-based models generate explanations for humor but operate in an open loop,lacking the ability to critique or refine their reasoning once a prediction is made. We propose FLoReNce, an agentic feedback reasoning framework that treats meme understanding as a closed-loop process during learning and an open-loop process during inference. In the closed loop, a reasoning agent is critiqued by a judge; the error and semantic feedback are converted into control signals and stored in a feedback-informed, non-parametric knowledge base. At inference, the model retrieves similar judged experiences from this KB and uses them to modulate its prompt, enabling better, self-aligned reasoning without finetuning. On the PrideMM dataset, FLoReNce improves both predictive performance and explanation quality over static multimodal baselines, showing that feedback-regulated prompting is a viable path to adaptive meme humor understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险领域，可解释AI需要帮助利益相关者信任和验证系统输出。现有思维链方法先推理后结论，存在逻辑断层和幻觉问题，导致结论与论证不一致

Method: 提出"结果→论证"方法，约束输出格式为先呈现结论后结构化论证。引入SEF框架，通过六个结构和基础性指标操作化专业惯例（如CREAC、BLUF）

Result: 在三个领域的四个任务上验证：所有六个指标都与正确性相关（r=0.20-0.42；p<0.001），SEF达到83.9%准确率（比思维链高5.3%）

Conclusion: 结构化论证可以提高AI输出的可验证性，并可能提高可靠性，为高风险领域的可解释AI提供了有效方法

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) in high-stakes domains should help stakeholders trust and verify system outputs. Yet Chain-of-Thought methods reason before concluding, and logical gaps or hallucinations can yield conclusions that do not reliably align with their rationale. Thus, we propose "Result -> Justify", which constrains the output communication to present a conclusion before its structured justification. We introduce SEF (Structured Explainability Framework), operationalizing professional conventions (e.g., CREAC, BLUF) via six metrics for structure and grounding. Experiments across four tasks in three domains validate this approach: all six metrics correlate with correctness (r=0.20-0.42; p<0.001), and SEF achieves 83.9% accuracy (+5.3 over CoT). These results suggest structured justification can improve verifiability and may also improve reliability.

Motivation: 大型推理模型虽然展现出多样的高级推理模式，但现有训练方法偏向于有限的优势模式，导致模型默认推理模式对特定问题往往不是最优的，存在显著的准确率差异。

Method: 提出Group Pattern Selection Optimization (GPSO)框架，扩展GRPO方法，包含：多模式探索、基于验证器的每问题最优模式选择、优化过程中的注意力掩码防止模式后缀泄漏到学习策略中。

Result: 大量实验表明GPSO在不同模型架构和基准测试中带来一致且显著的性能提升，有效缓解模式次优问题，促进更鲁棒、适应性更强的推理能力。

Conclusion: GPSO通过探索多样化推理策略组合并优化最有效策略，使模型能够内化从问题特征到最优推理模式的映射，提升推理模型的整体性能。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) exhibit diverse high-level reasoning patterns (e.g., direct solution, reflection-and-verification, and exploring multiple solutions), yet prevailing training recipes implicitly bias models toward a limited set of dominant patterns. Through a systematic analysis, we identify substantial accuracy variance across these patterns on mathematics and science benchmarks, revealing that a model's default reasoning pattern is often sub-optimal for a given problem. To address this, we introduce Group Pattern Selection Optimization (GPSO), a reinforcement learning framework that extends GRPO by incorporating multi-pattern rollouts, verifier-guided optimal pattern selection per problem, and attention masking during optimization to prevent the leakage of explicit pattern suffixes into the learned policy. By exploring a portfolio of diverse reasoning strategies and optimizing the policy on the most effective ones, GPSO enables the model to internalize the mapping from problem characteristics to optimal reasoning patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GPSO delivers consistent and substantial performance gains across various model backbones and benchmarks, effectively mitigating pattern sub-optimality and fostering more robust, adaptable reasoning.

TL;DR: 本文反对LLM确定性推理，主张随机CHAOS方法，认为确定性推理会掩盖不确定性、抑制涌现能力、弱化安全对齐


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM推理堆栈追求确定性推理，但作者认为这违背了LLM作为条件分布的本质，会系统性掩盖人工认知的关键特性

Method: 提出Stochastic CHAOS方法，将分布变异性视为需要测量和控制的信号，而非消除的噪声

Result: 实证显示确定性推理会系统性误导：低估能力和脆弱性、掩盖涌现能力的相变、降低多路径推理准确性、低估安全风险

Conclusion: LLM应该被视为条件分布而非固定函数，确定性推理会杀死LLM的关键认知特性，应接受并控制随机性而非消除它

Abstract: Deterministic inference is a comforting ideal in classical software: the same program on the same input should always produce the same output. As large language models move into real-world deployment, this ideal has been imported wholesale into inference stacks. Recent work from the Thinking Machines Lab has presented a detailed analysis of nondeterminism in LLM inference, showing how batch-invariant kernels and deterministic attention can enforce bitwise-identical outputs, positioning deterministic inference as a prerequisite for reproducibility and enterprise reliability.
  In this paper, we take the opposite stance. We argue that, for LLMs, deterministic inference kills. It kills the ability to model uncertainty, suppresses emergent abilities, collapses reasoning into a single brittle path, and weakens safety alignment by hiding tail risks. LLMs implement conditional distributions over outputs, not fixed functions. Collapsing these distributions to a single canonical completion may appear reassuring, but it systematically conceals properties central to artificial cognition. We instead advocate Stochastic CHAOS, treating distributional variability as a signal to be measured and controlled.
  Empirically, we show that deterministic inference is systematically misleading. Single-sample deterministic evaluation underestimates both capability and fragility, masking failure probability under paraphrases and noise. Phase-like transitions associated with emergent abilities disappear under greedy decoding. Multi-path reasoning degrades when forced onto deterministic backbones, reducing accuracy and diagnostic insight. Finally, deterministic evaluation underestimates safety risk by hiding rare but dangerous behaviors that appear only under multi-sample evaluation.

TL;DR: 通过多模型共识学习提升LLM可靠性：使用图注意力网络结合语义嵌入、相似度聚类等特征，在资源受限环境下显著提升准确率并减少幻觉


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在实例层面仍不可靠，存在幻觉、脆弱失败和校准不佳等问题。研究通过多模型共识学习来识别最可能正确的答案，提升LLM可靠性。

Method: 提出多模型共识推理引擎：将多个异构LLM的输出作为监督元学习器的输入，使用语义嵌入、成对相似度、聚类统计、词汇结构线索、推理质量评分、置信度估计和模型先验等特征，应用梯度提升树、列表排序和图神经网络（基于相似度图的图注意力网络）。

Result: 在GSM8K、ARC-Challenge、HellaSwag和TruthfulQA的紧凑子集上评估，最佳图注意力共识模型比最强单模型提升4.6个百分点，比多数投票提升8.1个百分点，同时获得更低的Brier分数和更少的TruthfulQA幻觉。

Conclusion: 语义一致性和聚类特征最具影响力，推理质量和模型先验特征提供补充增益。监督多模型共识是提升LLM可靠性的实用途径，即使在单机资源受限环境中也有效。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong aver- age performance yet remain unreliable at the instance level, with frequent hallucinations, brittle failures, and poorly calibrated confidence. We study reliability through the lens of multi-model consensus: given responses from several heterogeneous LLMs, can we learn which answer is most likely correct for a given query? We introduce a Multi-Model Consensus Reasoning Engine that treats the set of LLM outputs as input to a supervised meta-learner. The system maps natural language responses into structured features using semantic embeddings, pairwise similarity and clustering statistics, lexical and structural cues, reasoning-quality scores, confidence estimates, and model-specific priors, and then applies gradient-boosted trees, listwise ranking, and graph neural networks over similarity graphs of answers. Using three open-weight LLMs evaluated on compact, resource- constrained subsets of GSM8K, ARC-Challenge, HellaSwag, and TruthfulQA, our best graph-attention-based consensus model improves macro-average accuracy by 4.6 percentage points over the strongest single LLM and by 8.1 points over majority vote, while also yielding lower Brier scores and fewer TruthfulQA hal- lucinations. Ablation and feature-importance analyses show that semantic agreement and clustering features are most influential, with reasoning-quality and model-prior features providing com- plementary gains, suggesting supervised multi-model consensus is a practical route toward more reliable LLM behavior, even in a modest single-machine setup.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有法律大语言模型依赖内部参数知识的"闭环推理"，缺乏对知识边界的自我意识，导致产生自信但错误的结论，无法满足法律领域对程序严谨性和法律逻辑的严格要求。

Method: 提出Legal Reasoning with Agentic Search (LRAS)框架，结合内省模仿学习和难度感知强化学习，使模型能够识别知识边界并处理法律推理的复杂性，实现从静态"闭环思维"到动态"主动查询"的转变。

Result: LRAS在实验中超越最先进基线8.2-32%，在需要可靠知识的深度推理任务中提升最为显著。

Conclusion: LRAS框架成功解决了法律大语言模型的知识边界识别问题，显著提升了法律推理的准确性和可靠性，为法律AI的实际应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: While Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated exceptional logical capabilities in mathematical domains, their application to the legal field remains hindered by the strict requirements for procedural rigor and adherence to legal logic. Existing legal LLMs, which rely on "closed-loop reasoning" derived solely from internal parametric knowledge, frequently suffer from lack of self-awareness regarding their knowledge boundaries, leading to confident yet incorrect conclusions. To address this challenge, we present Legal Reasoning with Agentic Search (LRAS), the first framework designed to transition legal LLMs from static and parametric "closed-loop thinking" to dynamic and interactive "Active Inquiry". By integrating Introspective Imitation Learning and Difficulty-aware Reinforcement Learning, LRAS enables LRMs to identify knowledge boundaries and handle legal reasoning complexity. Empirical results demonstrate that LRAS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 8.2-32\%, with the most substantial gains observed in tasks requiring deep reasoning with reliable knowledge. We will release our data and models for further exploration soon.

Method: 提出ARM方法：1)构建融合骨干网络；2)基于角色条件激活分析进行选择；3)神经元移植进行细粒度优化。这是一个三步框架，无需基于梯度的优化。

Result: ARM在多个领域超越了先前的模型融合方法和领域特定专家模型，同时展现出强大的跨领域泛化能力，显著提高了智能体在交互环境中的泛化性能。

Conclusion: ARM成功将模型融合方法从静态自然语言任务扩展到多轮智能体场景，通过激活引导、角色条件的神经元移植实现了高效的跨环境泛化，为LLM智能体的适应性提供了训练自由的解决方案。

Abstract: Interactive large language model agents have advanced rapidly, but most remain specialized to a single environment and fail to adapt robustly to other environments. Model merging offers a training-free alternative by integrating multiple experts into a single model. In this paper, we propose Agent-Role Merging (ARM), an activation-guided, role-conditioned neuron transplantation method for model merging in LLM agents. ARM improves existing merging methods from static natural language tasks to multi-turn agent scenarios, and over the generalization ability across various interactive environments. This is achieved with a well designed 3-step framework: 1) constructing merged backbones, 2) selection based on its role-conditioned activation analysis, and 3) neuron transplantation for fine-grained refinements. Without gradient-based optimization, ARM improves cross-benchmark generalization while enjoying efficiency. Across diverse domains, the model obtained via ARM merging outperforms prior model merging methods and domain-specific expert models, while demonstrating strong out-of-domain generalization.

Conclusion: 该工作为自主事件解决和变更影响缓解奠定了基础，未来系统不仅能诊断和修复基础设施故障，还能预测计划变更对服务和客户的影响，使运维人员能够在执行维护操作前缓解风险

Abstract: Large-scale telecom and datacenter infrastructures rely on multi-layered service and resource models, where failures propagate across physical and logical components and affect multiple customers. Traditional approaches to root cause analysis(RCA) rely on hard-coded graph traversal algorithms or rule-based correlation engines, which are costly to maintain and tightly coupled to the infrastructure model.
  In this work, we introduce an agentic diagnostic framework where a Large Language Model (LLM) performs step-wise investigation using a constrained tool space exposed through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Instead of embedding causal logic or traversal algorithms into the application, the agent autonomously navigates the infrastructure model by invoking tools for service lookup, dependency retrieval, structured and unstructured data, and event analysis, and impact discovery. We define an investigation protocol that structures the agent's reasoning and ensures grounding, reproducibility, and safe handling of missing or ambiguous information.
  This work lays the foundation for autonomous incident resolution and change impact mitigation. Future systems will not only diagnose and remediate infrastructure failures, but also predict the impact of planned changes on services and customers, enabling operators to mitigate risks before executing maintenance operations.

Motivation: 随着AI技术的快速发展，如何公平一致地比较人类与人工智能成为重要理论问题。现有智能定义大多以人类为中心，不适合实证比较，导致研究领域缺乏共识。

Method: 基于卡尔纳普的概念澄清方法论，提出评估智能定义的四个标准：与解释项的相似性、精确性、丰富性和简洁性。分析六种代表性定义，提出扩展预测假说(EPH)，将智能定义为准确预测未来并从预测中获益的能力，区分自发与反应性预测，并引入获益性概念。

Result: 基于预测能力的定义具有高解释力和实证可行性，但无法充分解释预测与行为/获益的关系。EPH通过结合预测能力和获益能力，提供了统一的解释框架，能够解释创造力、学习、未来规划等智能的各个方面。

Conclusion: 扩展预测假说(EPH)是最令人满意且通用的定义，适用于比较人类与AI智能，为解决智能比较的理论问题提供了统一框架。

Abstract: This paper aims to propose a universal definition of intelligence that enables fair and consistent comparison of human and artificial intelligence (AI). With the rapid development of AI technology in recent years, how to compare and evaluate human and AI intelligence has become an important theoretical issue. However, existing definitions of intelligence are anthropocentric and unsuitable for empirical comparison, resulting in a lack of consensus in the research field.
  This paper first introduces four criteria for evaluating intelligence definitions based on R. Carnap's methodology of conceptual clarification: similarity to explicandum, exactness, fruitfulness, and simplicity. We then examine six representative definitions: IQ testing, complex problem-solving ability, reward optimization, environmental adaptation, learning efficiency, and predictive ability, and clarify their theoretical strengths and limitations.
  The results show that while definitions based on predictive ability have high explanatory power and empirical feasibility, they suffer from an inability to adequately explain the relationship between predictions and behavior/benefits. This paper proposes the Extended Predictive Hypothesis (EPH), which views intelligence as a combination of the ability to accurately predict the future and the ability to benefit from those predictions. Furthermore, by distinguishing predictive ability into spontaneous and reactive predictions and adding the concept of gainability, we present a unified framework for explaining various aspects of intelligence, such as creativity, learning, and future planning. In conclusion, this paper argues that the EPH is the most satisfactory and universal definition for comparing human and AI intelligence.

Conclusion: OpenTinker提供了一个模块化的基础设施，通过分离关注点来改进大语言模型智能体强化学习系统的构建和管理，使研究人员能够更灵活地组合组件并有效利用共享资源。

Abstract: We introduce OpenTinker, an infrastructure for reinforcement learning (RL) of large language model (LLM) agents built around a separation of concerns across algorithm design, execution, and agent-environment interaction. Rather than relying on monolithic, end-to-end RL pipelines, OpenTinker decomposes agentic learning systems into lightweight, composable components with clearly defined abstraction boundaries. Users specify agents, environments, and interaction protocols, while inference and training are delegated to a managed execution runtime. OpenTinker introduces a centralized scheduler for managing training and inference workloads, including LoRA-based and full-parameter RL, supervised fine-tuning, and inference, over shared resources. We further discuss design principles for extending OpenTinker to multi-agent training. Finally, we present a set of RL use cases that demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework in practical agentic learning scenarios.

Abstract: Modular end-to-end (ME2E) autonomous driving paradigms combine modular interpretability with global optimization capability and have demonstrated strong performance. However, existing studies mainly focus on accuracy improvement, while critical system-level factors such as inference latency and energy consumption are often overlooked, resulting in increasingly complex model designs that hinder practical deployment. Prior efforts on model compression and acceleration typically optimize either the software or hardware side in isolation. Software-only optimization cannot fundamentally remove intermediate tensor access and operator scheduling overheads, whereas hardware-only optimization is constrained by model structure and precision. As a result, the real-world benefits of such optimizations are often limited. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a reusable software and hardware co-optimization and closed-loop evaluation framework for ME2E autonomous driving inference. The framework jointly integrates software-level model optimization with hardware-level computation optimization under a unified system-level objective. In addition, a multidimensional evaluation metric is introduced to assess system performance by jointly considering safety, comfort, efficiency, latency, and energy, enabling quantitative comparison of different optimization strategies. Experiments across multiple ME2E autonomous driving stacks show that the proposed framework preserves baseline-level driving performance while significantly reducing inference latency and energy consumption, achieving substantial overall system-level improvements. These results demonstrate that the proposed framework provides practical and actionable guidance for efficient deployment of ME2E autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: Offline multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) aims to solve cooperative decision-making problems in multi-agent systems using pre-collected datasets. Existing offline MARL methods primarily constrain training within the dataset distribution, resulting in overly conservative policies that struggle to generalize beyond the support of the data. While model-based approaches offer a promising solution by expanding the original dataset with synthetic data generated from a learned world model, the high dimensionality, non-stationarity, and complexity of multi-agent systems make it challenging to accurately estimate the transitions and reward functions in offline MARL. Given the difficulty of directly modeling joint dynamics, we propose a local-to-global (LOGO) world model, a novel framework that leverages local predictions-which are easier to estimate-to infer global state dynamics, thus improving prediction accuracy while implicitly capturing agent-wise dependencies. Using the trained world model, we generate synthetic data to augment the original dataset, expanding the effective state-action space. To ensure reliable policy learning, we further introduce an uncertainty-aware sampling mechanism that adaptively weights synthetic data by prediction uncertainty, reducing approximation error propagation to policies. In contrast to conventional ensemble-based methods, our approach requires only an additional encoder for uncertainty estimation, significantly reducing computational overhead while maintaining accuracy. Extensive experiments across 8 scenarios against 8 baselines demonstrate that our method surpasses state-of-the-art baselines on standard offline MARL benchmarks, establishing a new model-based baseline for generalizable offline multi-agent learning.

TL;DR: IFDNS是一种基于提示的神经符号方法，通过多轮反馈机制解决LLM在复杂逻辑关系处理中的局限性，显著提升推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示方法（如CoT）在LLM推理中存在忠实性问题，推理链与结论不一致；现有神经符号方法存在信息丢失问题，需要更有效的方法来增强LLM的逻辑推理能力。

Method: 提出IFDNS方法：1）在逻辑提取阶段使用迭代反馈机制，准确提取因果关系陈述并转换为命题和逻辑蕴含表达式；2）与现有提示方法正交，可无缝集成各种提示方法；3）通过多轮反馈解决复杂逻辑关系处理问题。

Result: 在六个数据集上的实证评估显示，IFDNS显著提升了CoT和CoT-SC的性能：在LogiQA数据集上为CoT带来+9.40%准确率提升，在PrOntoQA数据集上为CoT-SC带来+11.70%改进。

Conclusion: IFDNS通过迭代反馈机制有效解决了LLM推理中的信息丢失和忠实性问题，显著提升了逻辑推理性能，且与现有提示方法兼容，具有实用价值。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across a wide range of reasoning tasks, including logical and mathematical problem-solving. While prompt-based methods like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) can enhance LLM reasoning abilities to some extent, they often suffer from a lack of faithfulness, where the derived conclusions may not align with the generated reasoning chain. To address this issue, researchers have explored neuro-symbolic approaches to bolster LLM logical reasoning capabilities. However, existing neuro-symbolic methods still face challenges with information loss during the process. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Iterative Feedback-Driven Neuro-Symbolic (IFDNS), a novel prompt-based method that employs a multi-round feedback mechanism to address LLM limitations in handling complex logical relationships. IFDNS utilizes iterative feedback during the logic extraction phase to accurately extract causal relationship statements and translate them into propositional and logical implication expressions, effectively mitigating information loss issues. Furthermore, IFDNS is orthogonal to existing prompt methods, allowing for seamless integration with various prompting approaches. Empirical evaluations across six datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of IFDNS in significantly improving the performance of CoT and Chain-of-Thought with Self-Consistency (CoT-SC). Specifically, IFDNS achieves a +9.40% accuracy boost for CoT on the LogiQA dataset and a +11.70% improvement for CoT-SC on the PrOntoQA dataset.

TL;DR: TSM是一个为LLM代理设计的时间语义记忆框架，通过建模语义时间线和构建持续性记忆，解决了现有方法在时间维度的不准确和碎片化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM记忆方法存在两个时间维度问题：1）时间不准确：按对话时间而非实际发生时间组织记忆；2）时间碎片化：只关注点状记忆，丢失了捕捉持续状态和演化模式的持续性信息。

Method: 提出时间语义记忆（TSM）框架：1）构建阶段：建立语义时间线而非对话时间线，将时间连续且语义相关的信息整合为持续性记忆；2）利用阶段：结合查询的时间意图在语义时间线上检索，提供时间有效、持续时间一致的上下文支持响应生成。

Result: 在LongMemEval和LoCoMo数据集上的实验表明，TSM始终优于现有方法，准确率绝对提升最高达12.2%，证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: TSM通过建模语义时间和构建持续性记忆，有效解决了LLM记忆中的时间维度问题，显著提升了记忆的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: Memory enables Large Language Model (LLM) agents to perceive, store, and use information from past dialogues, which is essential for personalization. However, existing methods fail to properly model the temporal dimension of memory in two aspects: 1) Temporal inaccuracy: memories are organized by dialogue time rather than their actual occurrence time; 2) Temporal fragmentation: existing methods focus on point-wise memory, losing durative information that captures persistent states and evolving patterns. To address these limitations, we propose Temporal Semantic Memory (TSM), a memory framework that models semantic time for point-wise memory and supports the construction and utilization of durative memory. During memory construction, it first builds a semantic timeline rather than a dialogue one. Then, it consolidates temporally continuous and semantically related information into a durative memory. During memory utilization, it incorporates the query's temporal intent on the semantic timeline, enabling the retrieval of temporally appropriate durative memories and providing time-valid, duration-consistent context to support response generation. Experiments on LongMemEval and LoCoMo show that TSM consistently outperforms existing methods and achieves up to 12.2% absolute improvement in accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Motivation: 人类活动识别是智能家居和辅助生活等情境感知应用的核心问题。最近研究表明大型语言模型可用于家庭活动识别并取得高性能，但大模型参数量大、计算成本高，需要探索如何在保持性能的同时减小模型规模。

Method: 在两个最先进的数据集上实验不同规模LLM的性能变化，并采用知识蒸馏技术：使用大型LLM生成HAR推理示例，然后用这些示例微调较小的LLM，将大模型的知识迁移到小模型。

Result: 实验显示识别性能随LLM规模变化，通过知识蒸馏微调的小型LLM性能几乎与最大LLM相当，但参数量减少了50倍。

Conclusion: 知识蒸馏技术能有效将大型LLM的HAR推理能力迁移到小型模型，在保持高性能的同时大幅减少参数量和计算成本，为实际部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a central problem for context-aware applications, especially for smart homes and assisted living. A few very recent studies have shown that Large Language Models (LLMs) can be used for HAR at home, reaching high performance and addressing key challenges. In this paper, we provide new experimental results regarding the use of LLMs for HAR, on two state-of-the-art datasets. More specifically, we show how recognition performance evolves depending on the size of the LLM used. Moreover, we experiment on the use of knowledge distillation techniques to fine-tune smaller LLMs with HAR reasoning examples generated by larger LLMs. We show that such fine-tuned models can perform almost as well as the largest LLMs, while having 50 times less parameters.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MCMA提出了一种可学习的记忆抽象方法，将记忆管理作为可学习的认知技能，通过记忆副驾驶实现记忆的结构化、抽象和选择性重用，显著提升了LLM智能体在长时决策任务中的性能和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM智能体方法通常将记忆存储为固定表示，并在单一或隐式抽象级别上重用，这限制了泛化能力，并在分布偏移时导致负迁移。需要一种更灵活的记忆抽象机制来改善跨任务和分布外场景的性能。

Method: MCMA将任务执行与记忆管理解耦：使用冻结的任务模型处理具体任务，同时训练一个记忆副驾驶（memory copilot）来管理记忆。记忆副驾驶通过直接偏好优化训练，负责决定记忆的结构化、抽象和重用方式。记忆被组织成层次化的抽象级别，基于任务相似性进行选择性重用。当没有可迁移的记忆时，MCMA通过迁移记忆副驾驶来迁移抽象和管理记忆的能力。

Result: 在ALFWorld、ScienceWorld和BabyAI三个基准测试中，MCMA相比多个基线方法在性能、分布外泛化和跨任务迁移方面都取得了显著提升。

Conclusion: 将记忆抽象作为可学习的认知技能而非固定设计选择是有效的，MCMA通过解耦任务执行与记忆管理，实现了更好的记忆重用和泛化能力，为LLM智能体的长时决策任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents increasingly rely on accumulated memory to solve long-horizon decision-making tasks. However, most existing approaches store memory in fixed representations and reuse it at a single or implicit level of abstraction, which limits generalization and often leads to negative transfer when distribution shift. This paper proposes the Meta-Cognitive Memory Abstraction method (MCMA), which treats memory abstraction as a learnable cognitive skill rather than a fixed design choice. MCMA decouples task execution from memory management by combining a frozen task model with a learned memory copilot. The memory copilot is trained using direct preference optimization, it determines how memories should be structured, abstracted, and reused. Memories are further organized into a hierarchy of abstraction levels, enabling selective reuse based on task similarity. When no memory is transferable, MCMA transfers the ability to abstract and manage memory by transferring the memory copilot. Experiments on ALFWorld, ScienceWorld, and BabyAI demonstrate substantial improvements in performance, out-of-distribution generalization, and cross-task transfer over several baselines.

Abstract: Optimizing LLM-based agentic workflows is challenging for scaling AI capabilities. Current methods rely on coarse, end-to-end evaluation signals and lack fine-grained signals on where to refine, often resulting in inefficient or low-impact modifications. To address these limitations, we propose {\our{}}, an Evaluation-Judge-Optimization-Update pipeline. We incorporate reusable, configurable logic blocks into agentic workflows to capture fundamental forms of logic. On top of this abstraction, we design a dedicated Judge module that inspects execution traces -- particularly failed runs -- and assigns rank-based responsibility scores to problematic blocks. These fine-grained diagnostic signals are then leveraged by an LLM-based optimizer, which focuses modifications on the most problematic block in the workflow. Our approach improves sample efficiency, enhances interpretability through block-level diagnostics, and provides a scalable foundation for automating increasingly complex agentic workflows. We evaluate {\our{}} on mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks, where {\our{}} achieves superior performance and efficiency compared to existing methods.

Our experiments benchmark the performance of several popular LLMs across tasks of increasing complexity, analyzing differences in adaptability, planning, and multi-agent coordination. We also describe our methodology for procedural task generation, task validation, and real-time environment control. VirtualEnv is released as an open-source platform, we aim to advance research at the intersection of AI and gaming, enable standardized evaluation of LLMs in embodied AI settings, and pave the way for future developments in immersive simulations and interactive entertainment.

TL;DR: TDP提出任务解耦规划框架，通过将复杂任务分解为有向无环图的子目标，限制推理和重规划在活动子任务范围内，防止错误传播，提高长时域任务的鲁棒性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM代理规划方法存在两种范式：逐步规划（反应式但短视）和一次性规划（生成完整计划但对执行错误脆弱）。两者都面临上下文纠缠问题，即代理必须在跨越多个子任务的整体历史中进行推理，增加了认知负担并让局部错误在独立决策间传播，使得恢复计算成本高昂。

Method: 提出任务解耦规划（TDP）框架，通过监督器将任务分解为有向无环图（DAG）的子目标，然后使用具有范围上下文的规划器和执行器，将推理和重规划限制在活动子任务内。这种隔离防止错误传播，并在局部纠正偏差而不中断工作流程。

Result: 在TravelPlanner、ScienceWorld和HotpotQA上的实验结果显示，TDP优于强基线方法，同时将token消耗减少高达82%，证明子任务解耦提高了长时域代理的鲁棒性和效率。

Conclusion: 任务解耦规划通过将复杂任务分解为有向无环图的子目标并限制推理范围，有效解决了现有规划方法的上下文纠缠问题，显著提高了长时域任务的执行鲁棒性和计算效率。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled agents to autonomously execute complex, long-horizon tasks, yet planning remains a primary bottleneck for reliable task execution. Existing methods typically fall into two paradigms: step-wise planning, which is reactive but often short-sighted; and one-shot planning, which generates a complete plan upfront yet is brittle to execution errors. Crucially, both paradigms suffer from entangled contexts, where the agent must reason over a monolithic history spanning multiple sub-tasks. This entanglement increases cognitive load and lets local errors propagate across otherwise independent decisions, making recovery computationally expensive. To address this, we propose Task-Decoupled Planning (TDP), a training-free framework that replaces entangled reasoning with task decoupling. TDP decomposes tasks into a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of sub-goals via a Supervisor. Using a Planner and Executor with scoped contexts, TDP confines reasoning and replanning to the active sub-task. This isolation prevents error propagation and corrects deviations locally without disrupting the workflow. Results on TravelPlanner, ScienceWorld, and HotpotQA show that TDP outperforms strong baselines while reducing token consumption by up to 82%, demonstrating that sub-task decoupling improves both robustness and efficiency for long-horizon agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有论文弱点识别方法存在三个主要问题：1) 多智能体系统仅表面模拟人类角色，缺乏专家评估论文互补智力方面的深层标准；2) 假设识别出的弱点都是有效的，忽略了审稿人偏见、误解以及作者反驳在验证评审质量中的关键作用；3) 大多数系统输出未排序的弱点列表，而不是为用户优先考虑最重要的缺陷。

Result: 在AAAR和ReviewCritique两个基准测试上的实验表明，DIAGPaper显著优于现有方法，能够产生更有效、更具论文特异性的弱点，并以用户导向、优先级排序的方式呈现。

Conclusion: DIAGPaper通过集成定制化审稿标准、作者-审稿人辩论验证以及基于人类实践学习的优先级排序，有效解决了现有论文弱点识别方法的局限性，提供了一个更可靠、用户友好的弱点识别框架。

Abstract: Paper weakness identification using single-agent or multi-agent LLMs has attracted increasing attention, yet existing approaches exhibit key limitations. Many multi-agent systems simulate human roles at a surface level, missing the underlying criteria that lead experts to assess complementary intellectual aspects of a paper. Moreover, prior methods implicitly assume identified weaknesses are valid, ignoring reviewer bias, misunderstanding, and the critical role of author rebuttals in validating review quality. Finally, most systems output unranked weakness lists, rather than prioritizing the most consequential issues for users. In this work, we propose DIAGPaper, a novel multi-agent framework that addresses these challenges through three tightly integrated modules. The customizer module simulates human-defined review criteria and instantiates multiple reviewer agents with criterion-specific expertise. The rebuttal module introduces author agents that engage in structured debate with reviewer agents to validate and refine proposed weaknesses. The prioritizer module learns from large-scale human review practices to assess the severity of validated weaknesses and surfaces the top-K severest ones to users. Experiments on two benchmarks, AAAR and ReviewCritique, demonstrate that DIAGPaper substantially outperforms existing methods by producing more valid and more paper-specific weaknesses, while presenting them in a user-oriented, prioritized manner.

Motivation: 企业表格数据缺乏语义理解能力，现有模型难以利用表格的结构化元数据和业务知识进行联合推理，需要建立语义感知的基准来推动表格基础模型发展。

Method: 在SALT基准基础上，将多表事务数据与操作业务知识图谱(OBKG)链接，OBKG包含字段级描述、关系依赖和业务对象类型，创建语义感知的评估框架。

Result: 元数据特征在传统预测指标上带来适度改进，但更显著地揭示了模型在利用语义进行关系上下文推理方面的能力差距，为语义条件推理提供了实证基础。

Conclusion: SALT-KG通过将表格预测重新定义为语义条件推理，建立了基于声明性知识的表格基础模型基准，为企业级结构化数据的语义链接表格提供了首个实证步骤。

Abstract: Building upon the SALT benchmark for relational prediction (Klein et al., 2024), we introduce SALT-KG, a benchmark for semantics-aware learning on enterprise tables. SALT-KG extends SALT by linking its multi-table transactional data with a structured Operational Business Knowledge represented in a Metadata Knowledge Graph (OBKG) that captures field-level descriptions, relational dependencies, and business object types. This extension enables evaluation of models that jointly reason over tabular evidence and contextual semantics, an increasingly critical capability for foundation models on structured data. Empirical analysis reveals that while metadata-derived features yield modest improvements in classical prediction metrics, these metadata features consistently highlight gaps in the ability of models to leverage semantics in relational context. By reframing tabular prediction as semantics-conditioned reasoning, SALT-KG establishes a benchmark to advance tabular foundation models grounded in declarative knowledge, providing the first empirical step toward semantically linked tables in structured data at enterprise scale.

Abstract: The central challenge of AI for Science is not reasoning alone, but the ability to create computational methods in an open-ended scientific world. Existing LLM-based agents rely on static, pre-defined tool libraries, a paradigm that fundamentally fails in scientific domains where tools are sparse, heterogeneous, and intrinsically incomplete. In this paper, we propose Test-Time Tool Evolution (TTE), a new paradigm that enables agents to synthesize, verify, and evolve executable tools during inference. By transforming tools from fixed resources into problem-driven artifacts, TTE overcomes the rigidity and long-tail limitations of static tool libraries. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we introduce SciEvo, a benchmark comprising 1,590 scientific reasoning tasks supported by 925 automatically evolved tools. Extensive experiments show that TTE achieves state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and tool efficiency, while enabling effective cross-domain adaptation of computational tools.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着智能体变得越来越通用（能够掌握各种任务），正确评估它们的复杂性和成本显著增加。评估特定能力的任务可能相关且具有随机性，需要大量样本进行准确比较，导致成本增加。需要一种更高效的评估方法来减少评估成本。

Method: 提出了一个主动评估框架，采用在线迭代方式：每次迭代中，排名算法选择要采样的任务和智能体，然后评估算法报告每个智能体的排名，并根据真实排名随时间评估其性能。比较了多种基线方法，包括经典的Elo评分系统和最近提出的Soft Condorcet Optimization方法。

Result: Elo评分系统在实践中是减少排名误差的可靠选择，尽管理论上存在已知的失败模式。Soft Condorcet Optimization在合成数据上与Elo表现相当，在真实的Atari智能体评估中显著优于Elo。当任务与真实排名的变异较大时，基于比例表示的任务选择能带来更高的排名误差减少率。

Conclusion: 主动评估框架能够有效减少多任务智能体评估的成本，Elo评分系统在实践中表现可靠，而Soft Condorcet Optimization在真实场景中表现更优。任务选择策略应根据任务变异情况调整以提高评估效率。

Abstract: As intelligent agents become more generally-capable, i.e. able to master a wide variety of tasks, the complexity and cost of properly evaluating them rises significantly. Tasks that assess specific capabilities of the agents can be correlated and stochastic, requiring many samples for accurate comparisons, leading to added costs. In this paper, we propose a formal definition and a conceptual framework for active evaluation of agents across multiple tasks, which assesses the performance of ranking algorithms as a function of number of evaluation data samples. Rather than curating, filtering, or compressing existing data sets as a preprocessing step, we propose an online framing: on every iteration, the ranking algorithm chooses the task and agents to sample scores from. Then, evaluation algorithms report a ranking of agents on each iteration and their performance is assessed with respect to the ground truth ranking over time. Several baselines are compared under different experimental contexts, with synthetic generated data and simulated online access to real evaluation data from Atari game-playing agents. We find that the classical Elo rating system -- while it suffers from well-known failure modes, in theory -- is a consistently reliable choice for efficient reduction of ranking error in practice. A recently-proposed method, Soft Condorcet Optimization, shows comparable performance to Elo on synthetic data and significantly outperforms Elo on real Atari agent evaluation. When task variation from the ground truth is high, selecting tasks based on proportional representation leads to higher rate of ranking error reduction.

Method: 扩展Chen等人(2025)的研究，通过设计实验让模型回答选择题，在提示中提供暗示，然后直接询问模型是否依赖这些提示，观察模型的否认行为

Result: 大型推理模型会明确否认依赖提示信息，即使被要求反思不寻常的提示内容，即使允许使用提示，且实验证据显示它们确实使用了这些提示

Conclusion: 研究结果表明大型推理模型不仅会隐藏推理过程，还会故意否认使用提示信息，这对思维链监控和模型可解释性提出了严峻挑战

Abstract: It has been shown that Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) may not *say what they think*: they do not always volunteer information about how certain parts of the input influence their reasoning. But it is one thing for a model to *omit* such information and another, worse thing to *lie* about it. Here, we extend the work of Chen et al. (2025) to show that LRMs will do just this: they will flatly deny relying on hints provided in the prompt in answering multiple choice questions -- even when directly asked to reflect on unusual (i.e. hinted) prompt content, even when allowed to use hints, and even though experiments *show* them to be using the hints. Our results thus have discouraging implications for CoT monitoring and interpretability.

Abstract: Dementia is a complex syndrome impacting cognitive and emotional functions, with Alzheimer's disease being the most common form. This study focuses on enhancing dementia prediction using machine learning (ML) techniques on patient health data. Supervised learning algorithms are applied in this study, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and Gaussian Process Classifiers. To address class imbalance and improve model performance, techniques such as Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) vectorization were employed. Among the models, LDA achieved the highest testing accuracy of 98%. This study highlights the importance of model interpretability and the correlation of dementia with features such as the presence of the APOE-epsilon4 allele and chronic conditions like diabetes. This research advocates for future ML innovations, particularly in integrating explainable AI approaches, to further improve predictive capabilities in dementia care.

TL;DR: 系统日志严重性分类作为评估小语言模型日志理解能力的基准，而非最终任务，通过RAG等方法显著提升模型性能，Qwen3-4B达到95.64%最高准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 系统日志规模庞大复杂，需要自动化解释。严重性分类作为预定义元数据，仅分类本身实用价值有限，但可作为评估模型日志理解能力的基准，特别是对于实时部署的数字孪生系统

Method: 使用真实Linux生产服务器journalctl数据，评估9个小语言模型(SLMs)和小推理语言模型(SRLMs)，在零样本、少样本和检索增强生成(RAG)提示下的表现

Result: Qwen3-4B在RAG下达到95.64%最高准确率；Gemma3-1B从少样本的20.25%提升到RAG的85.28%；Qwen3-0.6B达到88.12%准确率。但部分SRLMs（如Qwen3-1.7B）在RAG下性能大幅下降。效率差异显著：Gemma和Llama变体推理时间<1.2秒/日志，而Phi-4-Mini-Reasoning需228秒/日志且准确率<10%

Conclusion: 架构设计、训练目标和在严格输出约束下整合检索上下文的能力共同决定性能。严重性分类可作为评估模型能力和实时部署性的有效基准，对根因分析和数字孪生集成有重要意义

Abstract: System logs are crucial for monitoring and diagnosing modern computing infrastructure, but their scale and complexity require reliable and efficient automated interpretation. Since severity levels are predefined metadata in system log messages, having a model merely classify them offers limited standalone practical value, revealing little about its underlying ability to interpret system logs. We argue that severity classification is more informative when treated as a benchmark for probing runtime log comprehension rather than as an end task. Using real-world journalctl data from Linux production servers, we evaluate nine small language models (SLMs) and small reasoning language models (SRLMs) under zero-shot, few-shot, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) prompting. The results reveal strong stratification. Qwen3-4B achieves the highest accuracy at 95.64% with RAG, while Gemma3-1B improves from 20.25% under few-shot prompting to 85.28% with RAG. Notably, the tiny Qwen3-0.6B reaches 88.12% accuracy despite weak performance without retrieval. In contrast, several SRLMs, including Qwen3-1.7B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, degrade substantially when paired with RAG. Efficiency measurements further separate models: most Gemma and Llama variants complete inference in under 1.2 seconds per log, whereas Phi-4-Mini-Reasoning exceeds 228 seconds per log while achieving <10% accuracy. These findings suggest that (1) architectural design, (2) training objectives, and (3) the ability to integrate retrieved context under strict output constraints jointly determine performance. By emphasizing small, deployable models, this benchmark aligns with real-time requirements of digital twin (DT) systems and shows that severity classification serves as a lens for evaluating model competence and real-time deployability, with implications for root cause analysis (RCA) and broader DT integration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在完整性监测应用中，重尾测量误差的边界估计对满足严格导航要求至关重要。现有方法难以同时紧密边界核心和尾部区域。

Method: 利用柯西分布核心的尖锐边界特性和高斯分布尾部的边界特性，构建混合模型。开发了确定对称单峰和非对称单峰重尾误差边界参数的流程，并证明了卷积后边界特性保持不变。

Result: 在模拟和真实数据集上，该方法能在核心和尾部区域紧密边界重尾误差。在位置域，相比单CDF高斯边界，对称重尾误差的平均垂直保护水平降低15%；相比导航离散包络和两步高斯边界，非对称重尾误差降低21%至47%。

Conclusion: 提出的柯西-高斯混合边界方法能有效紧密边界重尾GNSS测量误差，显著降低保护水平，提高导航完整性监测性能。

Abstract: Overbounds of heavy-tailed measurement errors are essential to meet stringent navigation requirements in integrity monitoring applications. This paper proposes to leverage the bounding sharpness of the Cauchy distribution in the core and the Gaussian distribution in the tails to tightly bound heavy-tailed GNSS measurement errors. We develop a procedure to determine the overbounding parameters for both symmetric unimodal (s.u.) and not symmetric unimodal (n.s.u.) heavy-tailed errors and prove that the overbounding property is preserved through convolution. The experiment results on both simulated and real-world datasets reveal that our method can sharply bound heavy-tailed errors at both core and tail regions. In the position domain, the proposed method reduces the average vertical protection level by 15% for s.u. heavy-tailed errors compared to the single-CDF Gaussian overbound, and by 21% to 47% for n.s.u. heavy-tailed errors compared to the Navigation Discrete ENvelope and two-step Gaussian overbounds.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel statistical approach that aims at the identification of valid and useful patterns in handwriting examination via Bayesian modeling. Starting from a sample of characters selected among 13 French native writers, an accurate loop reconstruction can be achieved through Fourier analysis. The contour shape of handwritten characters can be described by the first four pairs of Fourier coefficients and by the surface size. Six Bayesian models are considered for such handwritten features. These models arise from two likelihood structures: (a) a multivariate Normal model, and (b) a MANOVA model that accounts for character-level variability. For each likelihood, three different prior formulations are examined, resulting in distinct Bayesian models: (i) a conjugate Normal-Inverse-Wishart prior, (ii) a hierarchical Normal-Inverse-Wishart prior, and (iii) a Normal-LogNormal-LKJ prior specification. The hierarchical prior formulations are of primary interest because they can incorporate the between-writers variability, a distinguishing element that sets writers apart. These approaches do not allow calculation of the marginal likelihood in a closed-form expression. Therefore, bridge sampling is used to estimate it. The Bayes factor is estimated to compare the performance of the proposed models and to evaluate their efficiency for discriminating purposes. Bayesian MANOVA with Normal-LogNormal-LKJ prior showed an overall better performance, in terms of discriminatory capacity and model fitting. Finally, a sensitivity analysis for the elicitation of the prior distribution parameters is performed.

TL;DR: 该研究比较了8种桥墩冲刷深度估算公式的准确性，使用USGS公开数据库进行验证，发现CIRIA和Froehlich公式在野外条件下最准确，并识别出攻击角、墩形和来流深度是最关键参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 桥墩冲刷是导致桥梁倒塌的主要原因，现有经验公式大多基于实验室数据校准，缺乏充分的野外数据验证。准确估算冲刷深度对桥梁安全和经济性至关重要，过高估计会增加建设成本，过低估计可能导致桥梁倒塌。

Method: 使用USGS公开的桥墩冲刷数据库（包含野外和实验室数据），比较了8种冲刷深度估算公式（包括英国CIRIA C742方法）。采用单参数敏感性分析和全局敏感性分析来识别各公式中最显著的参数。

Result: 研究发现：1）CIRIA和Froehlich公式在野外条件下最准确；2）攻击角、墩形和来流深度是最具影响力的参数；3）全局敏感性分析比传统的单参数分析提供更多见解；4）减少这三个参数的不确定性可最大程度提高冲刷估算精度。

Conclusion: 对于桥墩冲刷估算，建议在野外条件下优先使用CIRIA和Froehlich公式，并特别关注攻击角、墩形和来流深度这三个关键参数的准确确定，采用全局敏感性分析方法能更好地理解参数影响。

Abstract: Bridge scour is a complex phenomenon combining hydrological, geotechnical and structural processes. Bridge scour is the leading cause of bridge collapse, which can bring catastrophic consequences including the loss of life. Estimating scour on bridges is an important task for engineers assessing bridge system performance. Overestimation of scour depths during design may lead to excess spendings on construction whereas underestimation can lead to the collapse of a bridge. Many empirical equations have been developed over the years to assess scour depth at bridge piers. These equations have only been calibrated with laboratory data or very few field data. This paper compares eight equations including the UK CIRIA C742 approach to establish their accuracy using the open access USGS pier-scour database for both field and laboratory conditions. A one-at-the-time sensitivity assessment and a global sensitivity analysis were then applied to identify the most significant parameters in the eight scour equations. The paper shows that using a global approach, i.e. one where all parameters are varied simultaneously, provides more insights than a traditional one-at-the-time approach. The main findings are that the CIRIA and Froehlich equations are the most accurate equations for field conditions, and that angle of attack, pier shape and the approach flow depth are the most influential parameters. Efforts to reduce uncertainty of these three parameters would maximise increase of scour estimate precision.

TL;DR: 重新评估生态推断问题，提出新的识别条件，揭示类似因果推断需要控制混杂因素，聚合过程限制条件期望函数为线性，提供新方法改进推断，实证显示所有方法都高估种族极化和党派投票


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生态推断问题（EI）旨在从聚合数据中估计条件均值，但现有方法存在识别问题。本文旨在重新评估EI，提供新的形式化识别条件，揭示聚合过程如何影响推断，并开发改进方法。

Method: 提出新的EI识别条件形式化，证明聚合过程限制条件期望函数为线性，从线性模型视角分析现有EI方法差异，开发基于识别和线性结果的新方法以灵活控制混杂因素。

Result: 识别条件显示类似因果推断需要控制混杂因素，聚合过程创造额外结构限制条件期望函数线性。实证分析显示，虽然协变量有帮助，但所有方法都倾向于高估种族极化和全国化党派投票。

Conclusion: 生态推断需要类似因果推断的混杂因素控制，聚合过程提供线性结构但不足以保证准确推断。新方法基于识别和线性结果改进推断，但所有方法仍存在系统性偏差，特别是在政治学应用中。

Abstract: Estimating conditional means using only the marginal means available from aggregate data is commonly known as the ecological inference problem (EI). We provide a reassessment of EI, including a new formalization of identification conditions and a demonstration of how these conditions fail to hold in common cases. The identification conditions reveal that, similar to causal inference, credible ecological inference requires controlling for confounders. The aggregation process itself creates additional structure to assist in estimation by restricting the conditional expectation function to be linear in the predictor variable. A linear model perspective also clarifies the differences between the EI methods commonly used in the literature, and when they lead to ecological fallacies. We provide an overview of new methodology which builds on both the identification and linearity results to flexibly control for confounders and yield improved ecological inferences. Finally, using datasets for common EI problems in which the ground truth is fortuitously observed, we show that, while covariates can help, all methods are prone to overestimating both racial polarization and nationalized partisan voting.

TL;DR: 提出一种利用多个短期代理结果估计长期处理效应的方法，通过正则化回归处理高维代理变量，在数字平台实验中解决长期效应难以直接观测的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字平台实验面临的核心挑战是：长期处理效应难以直接测量，而短期代理结果众多且嘈杂。需要一种系统方法来利用这些短期代理变量准确估计长期效应。

Method: 将问题形式化为潜变量模型，将观测到的代理变量视为低维未观测替代变量的噪声测量。采用正则化回归方法（特别是岭回归），通过理论分析证明其优于朴素代理选择方法。

Result: 理论分析和模拟显示，正则化回归方法显著优于朴素代理选择。岭回归的偏差随代理变量增加而减小，获得了偏差-方差权衡的闭式表达式。在加州GAIN实验中验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为利用多个短期代理结果估计长期处理效应提供了有效解决方案，正则化回归在处理高维代理变量时表现出色，特别适用于数字平台实验场景。

Abstract: We propose a method for estimating long-term treatment effects with many short-term proxy outcomes: a central challenge when experimenting on digital platforms. We formalize this challenge as a latent variable problem where observed proxies are noisy measures of a low-dimensional set of unobserved surrogates that mediate treatment effects. Through theoretical analysis and simulations, we demonstrate that regularized regression methods substantially outperform naive proxy selection. We show in particular that the bias of Ridge regression decreases as more proxies are added, with closed-form expressions for the bias-variance tradeoff. We illustrate our method with an empirical application to the California GAIN experiment.

TL;DR: 时间序列基础模型（TSFMs）在农业市场预测中首次系统性超越传统简单方法，Time-MoE模型将预测精度提升45%，标志着农业预测的范式转变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 农业市场预测长期面临非线性动态、结构突变和稀疏数据等挑战，传统观点认为简单时间序列方法通常优于复杂模型。本文旨在验证这一观点在现代时间序列基础模型时代是否仍然成立。

Method: 使用1997-2025年USDA ERS数据，评估17种预测方法（涵盖4个模型类别），包括5种最先进的时间序列基础模型（TSFMs）。采用零样本基础模型（仅使用历史价格数据，无额外协变量），并与传统时间序列方法、机器学习和深度学习模型进行对比。

Result: 零样本基础模型一致优于所有传统方法。Time-MoE模型表现最佳，整体MAE提升45%，玉米和大豆预测精度提升超过50%（相对于USDA基准）。现代预训练基础模型实现了实质性和稳健的改进。

Conclusion: 农业预测正经历范式转变：早期复杂模型难以超越简单基准，而现代预训练基础模型提供了可扩展且强大的新框架，在高风险预测分析中具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Forecasting agricultural markets remains a core challenge in business analytics, where nonlinear dynamics, structural breaks, and sparse data have historically limited the gains from increasingly complex econometric and machine learning models. As a result, a long-standing belief in the literature is that simple time-series methods often outperform more advanced alternatives. This paper provides the first systematic evidence that this belief no longer holds in the modern era of time-series foundation models (TSFMs). Using USDA ERS data from 1997-2025, we evaluate 17 forecasting approaches across four model classes, assessing monthly forecasting performance and benchmarking against Market Year Average (MYA) price predictions. This period spans multiple agricultural cycles, major policy changes, and major market disruptions, with substantial cross-commodity price volatility. Focusing on five state-of-the-art TSFMs, we show that zero-shot foundation models (with only historical prices and without any additional covariates) consistently outperform traditional time-series methods, machine learning models, and deep learning architectures trained from scratch. Among them, Time-MoE delivers the largest accuracy gains, improving forecasts by 45% (MAE) overall and by more than 50% for corn and soybeans relative to USDA benchmarks. These results point to a paradigm shift in agricultural forecasting: while earlier generations of advanced models struggled to surpass simple benchmarks, modern pre-trained foundation models achieve substantial and robust improvements, offering a scalable and powerful new framework for highstakes predictive analytics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统预测优化标准通常只关注单一指标（如最小化均方误差），忽略了预测性能的其他重要方面，无法平衡多个可能冲突的优先级和目标。

Method: 引入平滑符号准确性（SSA）框架，同时考虑符号准确性、均方误差和预测符号变化频率，将多种设计目标整合到预测性能中，并扩展到非平稳集成过程，特别关注控制预测的单调性。

Result: SSA标准能够有效整合与准确性-平滑性预测性能相关的各种设计目标，推广了传统的基于均方误差的指标，并在商业周期分析工具中展示了广泛适用性。

Conclusion: SSA框架为解决预测中的准确性-平滑性权衡问题提供了有效方法，具有广泛的适用性，能够适应多样化的预测场景。

Abstract: Forecasting entails a complex estimation challenge, as it requires balancing multiple, often conflicting, priorities and objectives. Traditional forecast optimization criteria typically focus on a single metric -such as minimizing the mean squared error (MSE)- which may overlook other important aspects of predictive performance. In response, we introduce a novel approach called the Smooth Sign Accuracy (SSA) framework, which simultaneously considers sign accuracy, MSE, and the frequency of sign changes in the predictor. This addresses a fundamental trade-off (the so-called accuracy-smoothness (AS) dilemma) in prediction. The SSA criterion thus enables the integration of various design objectives related to AS forecasting performance, effectively generalizing conventional MSE-based metrics. We further extend this methodology to accommodate non-stationary, integrated processes, with particular emphasis on controlling the predictor's monotonicity. Moreover, we demonstrate the broad applicability of our approach through an application to, and customization of, established business cycle analysis tools, highlighting its versatility across diverse forecasting contexts.

TL;DR: 提出用于短面板线性模型的EB G-modeling框架，支持多维异质性和非参数先验，证明NPMLE的识别性和一致性，开发Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao梯度流算法，实证显示经验斜率系数存在显著异质性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统面板模型通常假设同质性或有限形式的异质性，无法充分捕捉个体间多维异质性（如截距、斜率、动态性、误差协方差结构等），需要开发更灵活的非参数框架来建模复杂的个体差异。

Method: 提出经验贝叶斯G-modeling框架，允许异质截距、斜率、动态性和非球形误差协方差结构；建立NPMLE的识别和一致性条件；开发适用于面板回归的Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao梯度流算法进行估计。

Result: 使用PSID数据发现：潜在经验的斜率系数存在显著异质性且与随机截距负相关；误差方差和自回归系数在个体间差异显著；EB估计相比个体MLE减少了均方预测误差。

Conclusion: 该框架为短面板线性模型提供了灵活的多维异质性建模方法，理论保证了估计的一致性，计算算法有效，实证应用展示了其在捕捉复杂个体差异和提升预测精度方面的价值。

Abstract: We develop an empirical Bayes (EB) G-modeling framework for short-panel linear models with multidimensional heterogeneity and nonparametric prior. Specifically, we allow heterogeneous intercepts, slopes, dynamics, and a non-spherical error covariance structure. We establish identification and consistency of the nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator (NPMLE) under general conditions, and provide low-level sufficient conditions for several models of empirical interest. Conditions for regret consistency of the resulting EB estimators are also established. The NPMLE is computed using a Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao gradient flow algorithm adapted to panel regressions. Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we find that the slope coefficient for potential experience is substantially heterogeneous and negatively correlated with the random intercept, and that error variances and autoregressive coefficients vary significantly across individuals. The EB estimates reduce mean squared prediction errors relative to individual maximum likelihood estimates.

Abstract: Estimating the Riesz representer is a central problem in debiased machine learning for causal and structural parameter estimation. Various methods for Riesz representer estimation have been proposed, including Riesz regression and covariate balancing. This study unifies these methods within a single framework. Our framework fits a Riesz representer model to the true Riesz representer under a Bregman divergence, which includes the squared loss and the Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence as special cases. We show that the squared loss corresponds to Riesz regression, and the KL divergence corresponds to tailored loss minimization, where the dual solutions correspond to stable balancing weights and entropy balancing weights, respectively, under specific model specifications. We refer to our method as generalized Riesz regression, and we refer to the associated duality as automatic covariate balancing. Our framework also generalizes density ratio fitting under a Bregman divergence to Riesz representer estimation, and it includes various applications beyond density ratio estimation. We also provide a convergence analysis for both cases where the model class is a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) and where it is a neural network.

TL;DR: 港口可持续性和数字化试点项目的效果取决于治理结构和所有权模式，地主模式通过合同条款支持成果规模化，工具/公共服务模式主要通过内部流程优化但外部扩展受限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有港口研究很少探讨所有权和决策权如何影响可持续性和数字化试点项目的实施过程与结果，而Living Lab（生活实验室）研究虽然概念丰富，但缺乏针对港口部门的治理适应性解释。

Method: 开发并应用治理-LL适应性框架，将港口治理和所有权与LL的四个支柱（共同创造、真实环境、迭代学习、制度嵌入）联系起来，通过对比案例研究分析奥尔堡能源社区试点和特雷勒堡绿色协调员功能两个港口。

Result: 地主治理模式通过特许权/租赁和招标条款提供合同基础，能够将LL成果制度化并支持跨租户和基础设施的规模化；工具/公共服务治理主要通过标准操作程序、采购规范和市政协调嵌入学习，实现内部运营收益但外部制度化需要专门协议。

Conclusion: LL的有效性取决于治理结构，反映了决策权的位置以及哪些工具能够将学习嵌入常规实践。关键需求包括明确的角色定义、持续的利益相关者参与以及与决策窗口的及时协调。

Abstract: Ports are pivotal to decarbonisation and resilience, yet port studies rarely examine how ownership and decision rights shape the process and outcomes of sustainability and digital pilots. Living Lab (LL) scholarship offers strong concepts, but limited sector-grounded explanation of LL-governance fit in ports. We develop and apply a governance-LL fit framework linking port governance and ownership to four LL pillars: co-creation, real-life setting, iterative learning, and institutional embedding (multi-level decision-making). We apply the framework in a comparative case study of two analytically contrasting ports, anchored in port-defined priorities: an Energy Community pilot in Aalborg and a Green Coordinator function in Trelleborg. Using an LL macro-meso-micro lens, we distinguish the stable constellation of actors and mandates (macro), the governance of specific projects (meso), and the methods used to generate and test solutions (micro). Findings show that Landlord governance offers contract- and procurement-based landing zones (concessions/leases and tender clauses) that can codify LL outputs and support scaling across tenants and infrastructures. Tool/Public Service governance embeds learning mainly through SOPs, procurement specifications, and municipal coordination, enabling internal operational gains but limiting external codification without bespoke agreements. Across both ports, key needs are clear role definition, sustained stakeholder engagement, and timely alignment with decision windows. Overall, LL effectiveness is governance-contingent, reflecting where decision rights sit and which instruments embed learning into routine practice.

Method: 基于可观测信号（穿越能力、恢复速度、N-1条件下的服务能力、预期未满足充电能量、队列影响）构建弹性KPI，使用DATEX II作为基础设施清单、状态和定价的基础框架，提供0-100标准化评分和可选的压力源特定细分分析。

Result: 开发了一个标准化的弹性KPI系统，能够将异构日志和KPI整合为单一可审计指标，支持月度/季度报告，使不同站点、供应商和管辖区的弹性表现具有可比性。

Conclusion: 该弹性KPI为充电站设计和运营决策提供了透明、一致的方法论，支持缓解措施的成本效益评估，但需要扩展更多KPI（如电网容量、现场灵活性、环境硬化等）以获得完整的弹性评估。

Abstract: We introduce a stressor-agnostic Resilience Key Performance Indicator (Resilience KPI) for megawatt charging stations (MSC) serving heavy-duty vehicles. Beyond routine performance statistics (e.g., availability, throughput), the KPI quantifies a site's ability to anticipate, operate under degradation, and recover from disruptions using observable signals already in the framework: ride-through capability, restoration speed, service under N-1, expected unserved charging energy, and queue impacts. The headline score is normalised to 0-100 for fair cross-site and cross-vendor benchmarking, with optional stressor-specific breakouts (grid, ICT, thermal, flooding, on-site incidents) for diagnostics and robustness checks. DATEX II provides a solid baseline for resilience KPIs centred on infrastructure inventory, status, and pricing, while additional KPIs, especially around grid capacity, on-site flexibility, heavy-vehicle geometry, environmental hardening, maintenance, and market exposure, are essential for a complete resilience picture and will require extensions or complementary data sources. The KPI is designed for monthly/quarterly reporting to support design and operational decisions and cost-benefit assessment of mitigations (e.g., backup power, spares, procedures). It offers a consistent, transparent methodology that consolidates heterogeneous logs and KPIs into a single, auditable indicator, making resilience comparable across sites, vendors, and jurisdictions.

Conclusion: XBTorch为基于新兴存储技术的交叉阵列系统提供了一个统一的模拟框架，有助于推动内存计算研究，代码已公开可用。

Abstract: Emerging memory technologies have gained significant attention as a promising pathway to overcome the limitations of conventional computing architectures in deep learning applications. By enabling computation directly within memory, these technologies - built on nanoscale devices with tunable and nonvolatile conductance - offer the potential to drastically reduce energy consumption and latency compared to traditional von Neumann systems. This paper introduces XBTorch (short for CrossBarTorch), a novel simulation framework that integrates seamlessly with PyTorch and provides specialized tools for accurately and efficiently modeling crossbar-based systems based on emerging memory technologies. Through detailed comparisons and case studies involving hardware-aware training and inference, we demonstrate how XBTorch offers a unified interface for key research areas such as device-level modeling, cross-layer co-design, and inference-time fault tolerance. While exemplar studies utilize ferroelectric field-effect transistor (FeFET) models, the framework remains technology-agnostic - supporting other emerging memories such as resistive RAM (ReRAM), as well as enabling user-defined custom device models. The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/ADAM-Lab-GW/xbtorch

TL;DR: TranSC：一种基于随机计算的硬件友好型超越函数实现方法，使用准随机Van der Corput低差异序列替代传统伪随机源，显著提升精度和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超越函数（无法用有限代数运算表示的函数）在数字电路设计中实现复杂，硬件友好型实现一直是设计自动化的长期挑战。

Method: 提出TranSC方法，基于随机计算技术，探索使用准随机Van der Corput低差异序列作为随机源，替代传统的伪随机源，以提升计算精度和效率。

Result: 实验验证了三角函数、双曲函数和激活函数等多种函数类型。相比最先进方案，MSE降低高达98%，硬件面积减少33%，功耗降低72%，能耗降低64%。

Conclusion: TranSC方法通过使用准随机低差异序列，实现了超越函数的轻量级且精确的硬件实现，在精度和硬件效率方面均有显著提升。

Abstract: The hardware-friendly implementation of transcendental functions remains a longstanding challenge in design automation. These functions, which cannot be expressed as finite combinations of algebraic operations, pose significant complexity in digital circuit design. This study introduces a novel approach, TranSC, that utilizes stochastic computing (SC) for lightweight yet accurate implementation of transcendental functions. Building on established SC techniques, our method explores alternative random sources-specifically, quasi-random Van der Corput low-discrepancy (LD) sequences-instead of conventional pseudo-randomness. This shift enhances both the accuracy and efficiency of SC-based computations. We validate our approach through extensive experiments on various function types, including trigonometric, hyperbolic, and activation functions. The proposed design approach significantly reduces MSE by up to 98% compared to the state-of-the-art solutions while reducing hardware area, power consumption, and energy usage by 33%, 72%, and 64%, respectively.

### [107] [Data-Driven Framework Development for Public Space Quality Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06026)
*Sherzod Turaev,Mary John*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 本研究开发了一个系统性的数据驱动框架，通过算法整合实证研究成果来评估公共空间质量。该框架将1,207个质量因素转化为包含14个主要类别和66个子类别的分层分类法，涵盖六种公共空间类型，识别出通用、特定和交叉功能因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前公共空间质量评估方法缺乏系统性，各学科方法分散，难以整合不同空间类型的因素并进行跨类型比较分析。需要开发一个能够整合多种空间类型因素并保持上下文相关性的系统方法。

Method: 采用7阶段方法论，从157篇同行评审研究中提取1,207个质量因素，通过语义分析、跨类型分布分析和领域知识整合，构建涵盖六种公共空间类型（城市空间、开放空间、绿色空间、公园和水滨、街道和广场、公共设施）的层次化分类法。

Result: 最终框架包含1,029个独特质量因素，分布在14个主要类别和66个子类别中。识别出278个适用于所有空间类型的通用因素、397个特定空间类型的独特因素，以及124个服务于多种功能的交叉因素。验证显示框架在因素组织和理论一致性方面具有系统性。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种将实证公共空间研究转化为实用评估框架的系统方法，支持基于证据的政策制定、设计质量评估和不同城市背景下的比较分析，填补了公共空间质量评估的系统方法论空白。

Abstract: Public space quality assessment lacks systematic methodologies that integrate factors across diverse spatial typologies while maintaining context-specific relevance. Current approaches remain fragmented within disciplinary boundaries, limiting comprehensive evaluation and comparative analysis across different space types. This study develops a systematic, data-driven framework for assessing public space quality through the algorithmic integration of empirical research findings. Using a 7-phase methodology, we transform 1,207 quality factors extracted from 157 peer-reviewed studies into a validated hierarchical taxonomy spanning six public space typologies: urban spaces, open spaces, green spaces, parks and waterfronts, streets and squares, and public facilities. The methodology combines semantic analysis, cross-typology distribution analysis, and domain knowledge integration to address terminological variations and functional relationships across space types. The resulting framework organizes 1,029 unique quality factors across 14 main categories and 66 subcategories, identifying 278 universal factors applicable across all space types, 397 space-specific factors unique to particular typologies, and 124 cross-cutting factors serving multiple functions. Framework validation demonstrates systematic consistency in factor organization and theoretical alignment with established research on public spaces. This research provides a systematic methodology for transforming empirical public space research into practical assessment frameworks, supporting evidence-based policy development, design quality evaluation, and comparative analysis across diverse urban contexts.

Method: 采用GITT-VT分析范式（整合量子物理、数理逻辑和信息论的世界观），研究BMF分析工具（包括bayesvl R软件包）7年的演变历程，评估其对早期职业研究者研究能力的贡献。

Result: 自2019年以来，bayesvl R包和BMF分析已支持22个国家的160多位作者，在跨学科领域发表了112篇同行评审论文，涵盖定性和定量设计，证明该工具能有效降低高级定量分析门槛。

Conclusion: 可访问的理论驱动计算工具能够降低高级定量分析障碍，培育更包容的方法论生态系统（特别是对资源匮乏的早期职业研究者），并为设计灵活、可复制、概念合理且适合跨学科研究的新一代研究方法提供参考。

Abstract: Methodological innovations have become increasingly critical in the humanities and social sciences (HSS) as researchers confront complex, nonlinear, and rapidly evolving socio-environmental systems. On the other hand, while Early Career Researchers (ECRs) continue to face intensified publication pressure, limited resources, and persistent methodological barriers. Employing the GITT-VT analytical paradigm--which integrates worldviews from quantum physics, mathematical logic, and information theory--this study examines the seven-year evolution of the Bayesian Mindsponge Framework (BMF) analytics and the bayesvl R software (hereafter referred to collectively as BMF analytics) and evaluates their contributions to strengthening ECRs' capacity for rigorous and innovative research. Since 2019, the bayesvl R package and BMF analytics have supported more than 160 authors from 22 countries in producing 112 peer-reviewed publications spanning both qualitative and quantitative designs across diverse interdisciplinary domains. By tracing the method's inception, refinement, and developmental trajectory, this study elucidates how accessible, theory-driven computational tools can lower barriers to advanced quantitative analysis, foster a more inclusive methodological ecosystem--particularly for ECRs in low-resource settings--and inform the design of next-generation research methods that are flexible, reproducible, conceptually justified, and well-suited to interdisciplinary inquiries.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 本文介绍了Kara-Kichwa数据主权框架，旨在保护安第斯原住民在全球数据生态系统中的权利和记忆，反对"知识绅士化"和系统性隐形。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 安第斯-亚马逊-大西洋走廊高海拔地区的原住民数据不仅是数字资源，更是Khipu Panaka（家谱和关系记忆）的延伸。当前全球数据生态系统存在"知识绅士化"问题，导致安第斯原住民被系统性隐形，需要建立数据主权框架来保护其权利。

Method: 基于原住民法律系统思维，开发了Kara-Kichwa数据主权框架这一"活工具"。该框架编纂了五个习惯支柱：Kamachy（自决）、Ayllu-llaktapak kamachy（集体权威）、Tantanakuy（关系问责）、Willay-panka-tantay（祖先记忆）和Sumak Kawsay（生物文化伦理），用于管理数据从生成到消亡的全生命周期。

Result: 提出了一个完整的原住民数据主权框架，将安第斯原住民的世界观和法律传统系统化地应用于数据治理，为保护原住民数据权利提供了具体的制度设计。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅是技术工具，更是文化抵抗和政治主张，旨在通过数据主权实现原住民的自决权、集体权威和生物文化伦理，对抗全球数据生态系统中的殖民遗留问题。

Abstract: In the high-altitude territories of the Andean-Amazonian-Atlantic pathway, data is not merely a digital resource but an extension of Khipu Panaka, the genealogical and relational memory of the Kara-Kichwa Republics. This perspective paper introduces the Kara-Kichwa Data Sovereignty Framework, a living instrument designed to counteract the "intellectual gentrification" and systemic invisibility of Andean Indigenous Peoples in global data ecosystems. Grounded in Indigenous legal systems thinking, the framework codifies five customary pillars, Kamachy (Self-determination), Ayllu-llaktapak kamachy (Collective Authority), Tantanakuy (Relational Accountability), Willay-panka-tantay (Ancestral Memory), and Sumak Kawsay (Biocultural Ethics), to govern the lifecycle of data from generation to expiration.

Motivation: 脑机接口技术从医疗系统扩展到消费和军事领域，将人类神经系统变为可网络化和竞争的对象。现有网络安全、生物医学安全和数据保护框架无法应对神经信号完整性的对抗性威胁，导致治理缺口和系统性错误分类

Method: 使用新加坡作为关键压力测试案例，应用制度分类分析和监管授权映射方法，识别结构性悖论。提出认知主权概念和认知操作技术框架

Result: 研究发现，即使在网络安全和生物医学领域具有高监管能力的国家，在两者交叉处仍然脆弱，原因是未能将人脑分类为基础设施。新加坡案例揭示了这一结构性悖论

Conclusion: 需要将人脑作为关键国家基础设施的独立层进行保护，提出认知主权概念作为保护神经过程免受外部调制的战略能力，并建立认知操作技术框架来保障认知安全

Abstract: As brain computer interfaces (BCIs) transition from experimental medical systems to consumer and military adjacent technologies, they introduce a novel security domain in which the human nervous system becomes a networked and contestable substrate. Existing frameworks for cybersecurity, biomedical safety, and data protection were not designed to address adversarial threats to neural signal integrity, creating a governance gap characterized by systemic misclassification. This paper argues that cognition is becoming strategic infrastructure and is situated between the market driven diffusion of neurotechnology in the United States and the state integrated fusion of AI and brain science in China. Using Singapore as a critical stress test and applying institutional classification analysis and regulatory mandate mapping, this paper identifies a structural paradox. A state with high regulatory capacity in both cyber and biomedical domains remains vulnerable at their intersection due to a failure to classify the human mind as infrastructure. This paper introduces the concept of cognitive sovereignty defined as the strategic capacity to protect neural processes from external modulation and proposes a cognitive operational technology framework to secure the human mind as a distinct layer of critical national infrastructure.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是了解新手程序员使用ChatGPT进行编程任务的意愿，特别关注性能期望、风险回报评估和决策过程对采用意愿的影响。

Method: 采用偏最小二乘结构方程模型（PLS-SEM），收集了413名新手程序员的数据进行分析。

Result: 研究发现：1）ChatGPT性能期望越高，编程决策越好；2）有利的风险回报评估使决策更自信有效；3）对ChatGPT决策作用的积极认知显著增加使用意愿。

Conclusion: 研究结论强调感知能力、风险评估和积极决策体验在促进AI工具在编程教育中采用的关键作用。

Abstract: This study explores the novice programmers' intention to use chat generative pretrained transformer (ChatGPT) for programming tasks with emphasis on performance expectancy (PE), risk-reward appraisal (RRA), and decision-making (DM). Utilizing partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) and a sample of 413 novice programmers, the analysis demonstrates that higher PE of ChatGPT is positively correlated with improved DM in programming tasks. Novice programmers view ChatGPT as a tool that enhances their learning and skill development. Additionally, novice programmers that have a favorable RRA of ChatGPT tend to make more confident and effective decisions, acknowledging potential risks but recognizing that benefits such as quick problem-solving and learning new techniques outweigh these risks. Moreover, a positive perception of ChatGPT's role in DM significantly increases the inclination to use the tool for programming tasks. These results highlight the critical roles of perceived capabilities, risk assessment, and positive DM experiences in promoting the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) tools in programming education.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估机器学习应用于遥感数据监测联合国可持续发展目标(SDGs)的性能表现，了解该领域的平均性能水平、研究间的异质性程度，以及哪些研究特征会影响模型性能。

Method: 采用PRISMA指南进行系统文献检索，三位评审筛选200篇研究，最终纳入20项研究中的86个试验。使用双反正弦变换和三级随机效应模型分析总体准确率，考察14个研究特征对性能的影响。

Result: 最佳模型的平均总体准确率为0.90[0.86, 0.92]，存在显著异质性（64%来自研究间差异）。多数类占比是唯一显著的特征，解释了61%的研究间异质性。其他13个特征无显著影响。

Conclusion: 总体准确率虽是最常用的性能指标，但因对类别不平衡敏感而缺乏洞察力。该领域需要标准化报告，特别是独立测试集的混淆矩阵报告，以确保机器学习分类器的跨研究可比性。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) is a tool to exploit remote sensing data for the monitoring and implementation of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In this paper, we report on a meta-analysis to evaluate the performance of ML applied to remote sensing data to monitor SDGs. Specifically, we aim to 1) estimate the average performance; 2) determine the degree of heterogeneity between and within studies; and 3) assess how study features influence model performance. Using PRISMA guidelines, a search was performed across multiple academic databases to identify potentially relevant studies. A random sample of 200 was screened by three reviewers, resulting in 86 trials within 20 studies with 14 study features. Overall accuracy was the most reported performance metric. It was analyzed using double arcsine transformation and a three-level random effects model. The average overall accuracy of the best model was 0.90 [0.86, 0.92]. There was considerable heterogeneity in model performance, 64% of which was between studies. The only significant feature was the prevalence of the majority class, which explained 61% of the between-study heterogeneity. None of the other thirteen features added value to the model. The most important contributions of this paper are the following two insights. 1) Overall accuracy is the most popular performance metric, yet arguably the least insightful. Its sensitivity to class imbalance makes it necessary to normalize it, which is far from common practice. 2) The field needs to standardize the reporting. Reporting of the confusion matrix for independent test sets is the most important ingredient for between-study comparisons of ML classifiers. These findings underscore the need for robust and comparable evaluation metrics in machine learning applications to ensure reliable and actionable insights for effective SDG monitoring and policy formulation.

TL;DR: 研究通过BotSim模拟社会网络，发现主动传播正面信息的好机器人比被动纠正错误信息的机器人更有效、可持续地对抗阴谋论传播


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前社会面临阴谋论传播问题，AI驱动的社交媒体机器人可以自动传播阴谋论。虽然组织通过人工事实核查和反叙事来对抗，但利用自动化创建有益机器人的效果尚未充分探索

Method: 创建BotSim基于代理的模型，在小世界网络中引入有益机器人：信息纠正机器人（将错误信息纠正为正确信息）和好机器人（传播正面信息）。模拟代理通过生成、消费和传播信息进行互动

Result: 如果不加控制，坏机器人可以创建阴谋论社会；信息纠正机器人和好机器人都能缓解这一问题，但好机器人更高效和可持续。主动传播正面信息比被动纠正信息更资源有效

Conclusion: 研究扩展了机器人作为恶意社交媒体代理的概念，表明自动化社交媒体代理既可用于恶意也可用于有益目的。这些结果对设计维持健康社交网络生态系统的沟通策略具有重要意义

Abstract: Societies can become a conspiratorial society where there is a majority of humans that believe, and therefore spread, conspiracy theories. Artificial intelligence gave rise to social media bots that can spread conspiracies in an automated fashion. Currently, organizations combat the spread of conspiracies through manual fact-checking processes and the dissemination of counter-narratives. However, the effects of harnessing the same automation to create useful bots are not well explored. To address this, we create BotSim, an Agent-Based Model of a society in which useful bots are introduced into a small world network. These useful bots are: Info-Correction Bots, which correct bad information into good, and Good Bots, which put out good messaging. The simulated agents interact through generating, consuming and propagating information. Our results show that, left unchecked, Bad Bots can create a conspiratorial society, and this can be mitigated by either Info-Correction Bots or Good Bots; however, Good Bots are more efficient and sustainable than Info-Correction Bots . Proactive good messaging is more resource-effective than reactive information correction. With our observations, we expand the concept of bots as a malicious social media agent towards automated social media agent that can be used for both good and bad purposes. These results have implications for designing communication strategies to maintain a healthy social cyber ecosystem.

TL;DR: 该研究提出"叙事极化"概念，通过分析YouTube视频和评论，发现视频内容产生高度极化的叙事，但评论却显著降低了表面叙事极化，然而深层叙事模式仍揭示党派差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有极化研究主要关注人群互动导致的群体隔离，但忽视了叙事本身如何塑造对立观点和党派身份。研究旨在探索极化群体如何集体构建和协商对现实的相反解释，以及叙事是否能在互动有限的群体间传播。

Method: 基于结构叙事理论，使用大语言模型分析212个YouTube视频和90,029条评论中的叙事角色分配，测量以色列-巴勒斯坦冲突中的叙事极化程度。

Result: 视频内容产生高度极化的叙事，但评论显著降低了表面叙事极化，使话语在表层趋于和谐。然而，深层叙事模式显示党派群体间存在额外差异。

Conclusion: 叙事极化是理解社会分歧的重要维度，表面话语和谐可能掩盖深层叙事差异，需要同时关注表层和深层叙事结构来全面理解极化现象。

Abstract: Polarisation research has demonstrated how people cluster in homogeneous groups with opposing opinions. However, this effect emerges not only through interaction between people, limiting communication between groups, but also between narratives, shaping opinions and partisan identities. Yet, how polarised groups collectively construct and negotiate opposing interpretations of reality, and whether narratives move between groups despite limited interactions, remains unexplored. To address this gap, we formalise the concept of narrative polarisation and demonstrate its measurement in 212 YouTube videos and 90,029 comments on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Based on structural narrative theory and implemented through a large language model, we extract the narrative roles assigned to central actors in two partisan information environments. We find that while videos produce highly polarised narratives, comments significantly reduce narrative polarisation, harmonising discourse on the surface level. However, on a deeper narrative level, recurring narrative motifs reveal additional differences between partisan groups.

Conclusion: ISMS-CR数字框架通过自动化工作许可流程，能够有效改善印度铁路车间的安全管理，解决系统性安全监督问题，提高安全合规性和操作可靠性

Abstract: Indian Railway workshops form the backbone of rolling-stock maintenance, employing over 250,000 workers across 44 major workshops nationwide. Despite their scale and operational importance, workshop safety remains a persistent challenge. A field study conducted at the Jhansi Wagon Workshop involving 309 workers revealed that while basic protective equipment such as shoes and helmets was universally used, compliance with complete personal protective equipment requirements was limited. Lacerations and abrasions were identified as the most frequent injury types, highlighting systemic gaps in safety oversight and work authorization practices.
  This paper presents ISMS-CR (Integrated Safety Management System for Central Railway Workshop), a modular digital framework designed to enhance safety management through an automated Permit-to-Work (PTW) module. The proposed system digitizes the full lifecycle of work authorization, including permit initiation, validation, approval, execution, and closure. By enforcing structured workflows, role-based accountability, and traceable digital records, ISMS-CR reduces manual errors, administrative delays, and procedural non-compliance. The framework aims to strengthen operational reliability, improve audit readiness, and support safer maintenance practices in high-risk railway workshop environments.

TL;DR: 本文评估AI生成法医证据在刑事审判中的可采性，发现尽管AI能提升证据分析规模，但存在可复现性缺陷和技术标准缺失等问题，需要建立专门的AI证据可采性标准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI在法医领域的应用日益广泛，虽然提高了调查效率，但现有研究对AI证据在法律程序中的界限和证据价值缺乏深入评估，需要明确AI生成证据是否符合法律可靠性标准。

Method: 采用比较法学的法律分析方法，研究普通法司法管辖区之间的证据标准，评估AI证据是否满足既定的法律可靠性要求。

Result: AI法医工具能增强证据分析规模，但存在可复现性缺陷；法院对AI证据接受度不一，主要受限于技术素养不足和标准化验证协议缺失；开发者和调查人员可能对错误输出承担责任。

Conclusion: 需要建立独立的验证机制和专门的AI证据可采性标准，以负责任地将AI整合到刑事司法系统中，促进可持续发展目标16的公平司法目标，并为未来实证研究奠定基础。

Abstract: This paper examines the admissibility of AI-generated forensic evidence in criminal trials. The growing adoption of AI presents promising results for investigative efficiency. Despite advancements, significant research gaps persist in practically understanding the legal limits of AI evidence in judicial processes. Existing literature lacks focused assessment of the evidentiary value of AI outputs. The objective of this study is to evaluate whether AI-generated evidence satisfies established legal standards of reliability. The methodology involves a comparative doctrinal legal analysis of evidentiary standards across common law jurisdictions. Preliminary results indicate that AI forensic tools can enhance scale of evidence analysis. However, challenges arise from reproducibility deficits. Courts exhibit variability in acceptance of AI evidence due to limited technical literacy and lack of standardized validation protocols. Liability implications reveal that developers and investigators may bear accountability for flawed outputs. This raises critical concerns related to wrongful conviction. The paper emphasizes the necessity of independent validation and, development of AI-specific admissibility criteria. Findings inform policy development for the responsible AI integration within criminal justice systems. The research advances the objectives of Sustainable Development Goal 16 by reinforcing equitable access to justice. Preliminary results contribute for a foundation for future empirical research in AI deployed criminal forensics.

TL;DR: 研究发现ChatGPT在拒绝移除水印请求后，会在整个会话中持续拒绝后续无关的图像生成请求，但文本请求仍正常响应


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多模态AI系统中安全机制与会话状态之间的交互关系，特别是单次拒绝后是否会影响后续无关请求的处理

Method: 使用ChatGPT网页界面进行手动测试，40个会话（30个实验组和10个对照组），实验组先上传版权图片并请求移除水印，然后进行无关图像生成请求

Result: 实验组在120次图像生成请求中拒绝了116次（96.67%），而对照组40次请求全部成功（p < 0.0001），文本请求在所有会话中均正常响应

Conclusion: 发现"安全状态持久化"现象，即版权拒绝会影响后续无关图像生成行为，这对多模态AI的可靠性、用户体验和会话级安全系统设计有重要启示

Abstract: Multimodal AI systems integrate text generation, image generation, and other capabilities within a single conversational interface. These systems employ safety mechanisms to prevent disallowed actions, including the removal of watermarks from copyrighted images. While single-turn refusals are expected, the interaction between safety filters and conversation-level state is not well understood. This study documents a reproducible behavioral effect in the ChatGPT (GPT-5.1) web interface. Manual execution was chosen to capture the exact user-facing safety behavior of the production system, rather than isolated API components. When a conversation begins with an uploaded copyrighted image and a request to remove a watermark, which the model correctly refuses, subsequent prompts to generate unrelated, benign images are refused for the remainder of the session. Importantly, text-only requests (e.g., generating a Python function) continue to succeed. Across 40 manually run sessions (30 contaminated and 10 controls), contaminated threads showed 116/120 image-generation refusals (96.67%), while control threads showed 0/40 refusals (Fisher's exact p < 0.0001). All sessions used an identical fixed prompt order, ensuring sequence uniformity across conditions. We describe this as safety-state persistence: a form of conversational over-generalization in which a copyright refusal influences subsequent, unrelated image-generation behavior. We present these findings as behavioral observations, not architectural claims. We discuss possible explanations, methodological limitations (single model, single interface), and implications for multimodal reliability, user experience, and the design of session-level safety systems. These results motivate further examination of session-level safety interactions in multimodal AI systems.

TL;DR: 尼日利亚通过《网络犯罪法》和《国家网络安全政策与战略》追求数字主权，但实施中存在立法模糊、执法薄弱、机构协调不足等问题，需要更强执行力和资源投入。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究尼日利亚如何在跨境网络威胁加剧的背景下，通过现有法律框架有效保障数字主权和安全，评估政策实施效果与差距。

Method: 采用多方法三角验证定性设计，包括文件分析、现有研究二次分析、专家见解和网络安全发展的直接观察。

Result: 《网络犯罪法》（2015年，2024年修订）和《国家网络安全政策与战略》（2015年，2021年修订）加强了尼日利亚打击网络犯罪、规范数字活动和保护关键基础设施的承诺，但仍存在立法模糊、执法薄弱、威胁优先级不均、机构协调有限和专业人才流失等差距。

Conclusion: 实现数字主权需要更强的实施力度、可持续的资源投入、人才保留和更清晰的问责机制，将政策雄心转化为切实持久的网络安全成果。

Abstract: This paper examines Nigeria's pursuit of digital sovereignty through two core instruments: the Cybercrimes (Prohibition, Prevention, etc.) Act and the National Cybersecurity Policy and Strategy (NCPS). Despite recent reforms, it remains unclear whether these frameworks effectively secure Nigeria's digital domain and advance its digital sovereignty amid escalating cross-border cyber threats. Using a multi-method, triangulated qualitative design that combines document analysis, secondary analysis of existing studies, expert insights, and direct observation of cybersecurity developments, the paper assesses how these instruments operate in practice. The Cybercrimes Act (2015, amended 2024) and NCPS (2015, revised 2021) have strengthened Nigeria's commitments to tackling cybercrime, regulating digital activities, and protecting critical infrastructure. Yet persistent gaps remain, including legislative ambiguities, weak enforcement, uneven threat prioritization, limited institutional coordination, and loss of skilled professionals. The paper argues that achieving digital sovereignty will require stronger implementation, sustainable resourcing, workforce retention, and clearer accountability mechanisms to translate policy ambition into tangible and durable security outcomes.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了魁北克省健康计划如何应对医疗信息系统互操作性挑战，发现虽然计划展现了技术现代化承诺，但未能全面解决互操作性的多维本质，在结构、语义和组织层面仍存在持续挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗数据的快速增长使得医疗系统面临前所未有的信息可用性，医疗信息系统在管理这些数据、改善医疗服务、系统性能和人口健康监测方面发挥核心作用。然而，最大化医疗信息系统的价值需要系统间的有效信息交换，这使得互操作性成为关键前提。尽管互操作性有公认的好处，但在魁北克健康和社会服务网络中仍然是一个主要挑战，主要原因是医疗信息系统在医疗机构间的异质性和碎片化。

Method: 使用医疗信息与管理系统协会（HIMSS）的互操作性维度框架（基础互操作性、结构互操作性、语义互操作性和组织互操作性）来评估魁北克省健康计划如何应对互操作性挑战。

Result: 研究发现：1）健康计划展示了加强基础设施和信息系统架构以支持基础互操作性的举措；2）在结构层面和语义层面存在持续挑战，特别是与采用标准化数据格式和临床术语协调相关的挑战；3）在组织互操作性方面识别出需要协调变革管理的重大实施挑战。

Conclusion: 虽然魁北克健康计划展现了明确的技术现代化承诺，但未能全面解决互操作性的多维本质。实现有意义的互操作性需要在技术、规范和组织领域持续努力，超越当前概述的策略。最近的治理发展，包括Sante Quebec的创建，为这一不断演变的背景增加了复杂性，并引发了关于互操作性治理协调的进一步问题。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of health data has led to unprecedented information availability within healthcare systems. Health information systems (HIS) play a central role in managing this data and enabling improvements in care delivery, system performance, and population health monitoring. Maximizing the value of HIS, however, requires effective information exchange across systems, making interoperability a critical prerequisite. Despite its recognized benefits, interoperability remains a major challenge within Quebec's Health and Social Services Network, largely due to the heterogeneity and fragmentation of HIS across healthcare institutions. This paper assessed how Quebec's Plan sante addressed interoperability challenges, using the dimensions from the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS): foundational, structural, semantic, and organizational interoperability. This study highlighted initiatives aimed at strengthening infrastructure and information system architecture to support foundational interoperability and showed persistent challenges at the structural and semantic levels, particularly those related to the adoption of standardized data formats and harmonization of clinical terminologies. Finally, significant implementation challenges that require coordinated change management were identified regarding the organizational interoperability. Overall, while the Plan sante demonstrates a clear commitment to technological modernization, it does not fully address the interoperability multidimensional nature. Achieving meaningful interoperability will require sustained efforts across technical, normative, and organizational domains beyond the strategies currently outlined. Recent governance developments, including the creation of Sante Quebec, add complexity to this evolving context and raise further questions regarding the coordination of interoperability governance.

Motivation: 欧盟能源绩效建筑指令要求成员国制定国家建筑改造计划，但瑞典缺乏建筑遗产价值国家登记册，这成为制定改造计划的障碍

Method: 使用多模态大语言模型分析瑞典各地街景图像（N=154,710），通过零样本预测评估建筑遗产价值方面

Result: 识别出500万平方米供暖面积的建筑具有潜在遗产价值，为瑞典建筑改造计划提供数据基础

Conclusion: LLM方法可为建筑改造计划提供支持，但需关注透明度、错误检测和顺从性等风险问题

Abstract: During 2025 and 2026, the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive is being implemented in the European Union member states, requiring all member states to have National Building Renovation Plans. In Sweden, there is a lack of a national register of buildings with heritage values. This is seen as a barrier for the analyses underlying the development of Building Renovation Plans by the involved Swedish authorities. The purpose of this research was to assist Swedish authorities in assigning heritage values to building in the Swedish building stock. As part of the analyses, buildings in street view images from all over Sweden (N=154 710) have been analysed using multimodal Large Language Models (LLM) to assess aspects of heritage value. Zero-shot predictions by LLMs were used as a basis to for identifying buildings with potential heritage values for 5.0 million square meters of heated floor area for the Swedish Building Renovation Plan. In this paper, the results of the predictions and lessons learnt are presented and related to the development of Swedish Building Renovation Plan as part of governance. Potential risks for authorities using LLM-based data are addressed, with a focus on issues of transparency, error detection and sycophancy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在揭示埃及数据工人在全球AI价值链中的角色和处境，关注这些被边缘化但至关重要的劳动力群体如何通过数字平台参与AI生产，以及他们的工作条件、身份认同和抵抗策略。

Method: 报告基于对埃及数据工人的调查研究，分析他们在国际数字劳动平台上的工作模式、收入状况、人口特征（主要为年轻高学历男性），并探讨算法控制与工人自主性之间的张力。

Result: 研究发现埃及数据工人主要为年轻高学历男性，收入低且不稳定（接近最低工资），工作受算法控制，数字身份与线下自我存在差异，但工人仍能通过抵抗、伦理判断和自主性维护来应对。

Conclusion: 报告呼吁通过埃及新劳动法和政策干预改善数据工人的工作条件，承认他们在全球AI价值链中的贡献，并支持他们获得更好的劳动权益保障。

Abstract: The report highlights the role of Egyptian data workers in the global value chains of Artificial Intelligence (AI). These workers generate and annotate data for machine learning, check outputs, and they connect with overseas AI producers via international digital labor platforms, where they perform on-demand tasks and are typically paid by piecework, with no long-term commitment. Most of these workers are young, highly educated men, with nearly two-thirds holding undergraduate degrees. Their primary motivation for data work is financial need, with three-quarters relying on platform earnings to cover basic necessities. Despite the variability in their online earnings, these are generally low, often equaling Egypt's minimum wage. Data workers' digital identities are shaped by algorithmic control and economic demands, often diverging from their offline selves. Nonetheless, they find ways to resist, exercise ethical agency, and maintain autonomy. The report evaluates the potential impact of Egypt's newly enacted labor law and suggests policy measures to improve working conditions and acknowledge the role of these workers in AI's global value chains.

TL;DR: 论文认为AI生成的"slop"（低质量内容）不应被简单视为数字污染，而应作为严肃研究对象，因为它具有社会功能、美学价值，并在文化经济中扮演重要角色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对AI Slop的普遍看法过于简单化，将其视为数字污染而忽视其重要特征。作者认为这种轻视态度会错过AI Slop值得深入研究的重要方面，包括其社会功能、美学价值和文化意义。

Method: 通过概念分析框架，识别AI Slop的三个关键家族相似性特征：表面能力（质量表象掩盖实质缺乏）、不对称努力（生成所需努力远低于非AI方式）、大规模生产性（属于广泛生成消费的数字生态系统）。同时提出AI Slop在三个维度上的变化：工具效用、个性化和超现实主义。

Result: AI Slop为文化经济需求提供了供给侧解决方案，满足了人们对内容的需求超过人类供给能力的矛盾。它具有自身的美学价值，能够表达意义和身份认同，是集体意义建构的合法手段。AI Slop将在创意、信息和文化经济中变得越来越普遍和重要。

Conclusion: AI Slop不应被简单视为数字垃圾，而应作为独立的研究对象严肃对待。它将在我们的创意、信息和文化经济中扮演越来越重要的角色，需要从社会功能、美学价值和文化意义等多维度进行深入研究。

Abstract: AI-generated "slop" is often seen as digital pollution. We argue that this dismissal of the topic risks missing important aspects of AI Slop that deserve rigorous study. AI Slop serves a social function: it offers a supply-side solution to a variety of problems in cultural and economic demand - that, collectively, people want more content than humans can supply. We also argue that AI Slop is not mere digital detritus but has its own aesthetic value. Like other "low" cultural forms initially dismissed by critics, it nonetheless offers a legitimate means of collective sense-making, with the potential to express meaning and identity. We identify three key features of family resemblance for prototypical AI Slop: superficial competence (its veneer of quality is belied by a deeper lack of substance), asymmetry effort (it takes vastly less effort to generate than would be the case without AI), and mass producibility (it is part of a digital ecosystem of widespread generation and consumption). While AI Slop is heterogeneous and depends crucially on its medium, it tends to vary across three dimensions: instrumental utility, personalization, and surrealism. AI Slop will be an increasingly prolific and impactful part of our creative, information, and cultural economies; we should take it seriously as an object of study in its own right.

Conclusion: AIAppOps框架通过系统化方法帮助组织应对数据驱动项目的挑战，实现持续改进、合规性和价值实现

Abstract: We outline a comprehensive framework for artificial intelligence (AI) Application Operations (AIAppOps), based on real-world experiences from diverse organizations. Data-driven projects pose additional challenges to organizations due to their dependency on data across the development and operations cycles. To aid organizations in dealing with these challenges, we present a framework outlining the main steps and roles involved in going from idea to production for data-driven solutions. The data dependency of these projects entails additional requirements on continuous monitoring and feedback, as deviations can emerge in any process step. Therefore, the framework embeds monitoring not merely as a safeguard, but as a unifying feedback mechanism that drives continuous improvement, compliance, and sustained value realization-anchored in both statistical and formal assurance methods that extend runtime verification concepts from safety-critical AI to organizational operations. The proposed framework is structured across core technical processes and supporting services to guide both new initiatives and maturing AI programs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然自主AI系统能提高生产力，但也带来新的伦理挑战。现有研究关注不同群体对负责任AI价值观的优先级，但缺乏对从业者如何在设计自主系统时进行伦理权衡推理的理解。

Method: 采用定性访谈方法，围绕自主AI部署中的结构化困境，调查AI从业者的伦理推理过程。

Result: 发现从业者的回应反映三种不同的推理框架：1)客户中心框架（基于商业利益、合法性和用户自主性）；2)设计中心框架（强调技术保障和系统约束）；3)伦理中心框架（优先考虑社会公益和超越合规的道德责任）。

Conclusion: 这些框架为应对伦理权衡提供了独特且必要的见解。自主AI提供商需要超越一般原则，积极管理这些不同推理框架在决策过程中的代表性，以确保稳健的伦理结果。

Abstract: Agentic artificial intelligence systems are autonomous technologies capable of pursuing complex goals with minimal human oversight and are rapidly emerging as the next frontier in AI. While these systems promise major gains in productivity, they also raise new ethical challenges. Prior research has examined how different populations prioritize Responsible AI values, yet little is known about how practitioners actually reason through the trade-offs inherent in designing these autonomous systems. This paper investigates the ethical reasoning of AI practitioners through qualitative interviews centered on structured dilemmas in agentic AI deployment. We find that the responses of practitioners do not merely reflect value preferences but rather align with three distinct reasoning frameworks. First is a Customer-Centric framework where choices are justified by business interests, legality, and user autonomy. Second is a Design-Centric framework emphasizing technical safeguards and system constraints. Third is an Ethics-Centric framework prioritizing social good and moral responsibility beyond compliance. We argue that these frameworks offer distinct and necessary insights for navigating ethical trade-offs. Consequently, providers of agentic AI must look beyond general principles and actively manage how these diverse reasoning frameworks are represented in their decision-making processes to ensure robust ethical outcomes.

TL;DR: AI数据中心的快速扩张导致电力、水资源和碳排放需求激增，到2030年全球数据中心电力需求可能翻倍，AI服务器在美国每年将额外消耗200-3000亿加仑水和2400-4400万吨CO2排放。冷却系统设计和地理位置对环境影响与硬件效率同等重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工智能的快速发展显著增加了现代数据中心的电力、水资源和碳需求，引发了可持续性担忧。本研究旨在评估AI服务器运营的环境足迹，并探讨可行的技术和基础设施策略来减轻这些影响。

Method: 采用基于文献的方法论，辅以定量预测和案例研究分析，评估全球电力消耗、冷却相关用水和碳排放趋势。

Result: 预测显示全球数据中心电力需求可能从2024年的约415 TWh增加到2030年的近945 TWh，AI工作负载占增长的不成比例份额。仅在美国，AI服务器预计到2030年将每年增加200-3000亿加仑水消耗和2400-4400万吨CO2当量排放。冷却系统设计和地理位置对环境影响与硬件效率同等重要。

Conclusion: 可持续的AI扩张需要协调改进冷却效率、可再生能源整合和战略部署决策。先进冷却技术可减少高达50%的冷却能耗，而位于低碳和水资源安全地区的部署可将综合足迹减少近一半。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of artificial intelligence has significantly increased the electricity, water, and carbon demands of modern data centers, raising sustainability concerns. This study evaluates the environmental footprint of AI server operations and examines feasible technological and infrastructural strategies to mitigate these impacts. Using a literature-based methodology supported by quantitative projections and case-study analysis, we assessed trends in global electricity consumption, cooling-related water use, and carbon emissions. Projections indicate that global data center electricity demand may increase from approximately 415 TWh in 2024 to nearly 945 TWh by 2030, with AI workloads accounting for a disproportionate share of this growth. In the United States alone, AI servers are expected to drive annual increases in water consumption of 200--300 billion gallons and add 24--44 million metric tons of CO2 quivalent emissions by 2030. The results show that the design of the cooling system and the geographic location influence the environmental impact as strongly as the efficiency of the hardware. Advanced cooling technologies can reduce cooling energy by up to 50%, while location in low-carbon and water-secure regions can cut combined footprints by nearly half. In general, the study concludes that sustainable AI expansion requires coordinated improvements in cooling efficiency, renewable energy integration, and strategic deployment decisions.

Abstract: Agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI) represents a fundamental shift in the design of intelligent systems, characterized by interconnected components that collectively enable autonomous perception, reasoning, planning, action, and learning. Recent research on agentic AI has largely focused on technical foundations, including system architectures, reasoning and planning mechanisms, coordination strategies, and application-level performance across domains. However, the societal, ethical, economic, environmental, and governance implications of agentic AI remain weakly integrated into these technical treatments. This paper addresses this gap by presenting a socio-technical analysis of agentic AI that explicitly connects core technical components with societal context. We examine how architectural choices in perception, cognition, planning, execution, and memory introduce dependencies related to data governance, accountability, transparency, safety, and sustainability. To structure this analysis, we adopt the MAD-BAD-SAD construct as an analytical lens, capturing motivations, applications, and moral dilemmas (MAD); biases, accountability, and dangers (BAD); and societal impact, adoption, and design considerations (SAD). Using this lens, we analyze ethical considerations, implications, and challenges arising from contemporary agentic AI systems and assess their manifestation across emerging applications, including healthcare, education, industry, smart and sustainable cities, social services, communications and networking, and earth observation and satellite communications. The paper further identifies open challenges and suggests future research directions, framing agentic AI as an integrated socio-technical system whose behavior and impact are co-produced by algorithms, data, organizational practices, regulatory frameworks, and social norms.

*Abu Syed*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 本文提出TEAS框架，通过四大支柱确保教育AI的可信度，强调系统架构比原始模型能力更重要，使经济型开源模型也能达到部署级可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI在教育领域的快速集成过于注重能力而忽视可信度，存在显著风险。现实部署显示，即使先进模型也需要大量架构支持才能确保可靠性。现有评估框架碎片化：机构政策缺乏技术验证、教学指南假设AI可靠、技术指标脱离情境，导致机构缺乏统一的部署准备标准。

Method: 提出TEAS（可信教育AI标准）框架，基于四个相互依存的支柱：(1)可验证性：将内容基于权威来源；(2)稳定性：确保核心知识的确定性；(3)可审计性：支持独立机构验证；(4)教学合理性：强制执行主动学习原则。

Result: 论证可信度主要来自系统架构而非原始模型能力，这意味着经济实惠的开源模型也能实现部署级可信度，为全球安全集成AI到学习环境提供了可扩展且公平的路径。

Conclusion: 通过TEAS框架的系统架构方法，可以确保教育AI的可信度，使各种模型都能安全可靠地应用于教育环境，促进AI在教育领域的公平、可扩展集成。

Abstract: The rapid integration of AI into education has prioritized capability over trustworthiness, creating significant risks. Real-world deployments reveal that even advanced models are insufficient without extensive architectural scaffolding to ensure reliability. Current evaluation frameworks are fragmented: institutional policies lack technical verification, pedagogical guidelines assume AI reliability, and technical metrics are context-agnostic. This leaves institutions without a unified standard for deployment readiness. This paper introduces TEAS (Trusted Educational AI Standard), an integrated framework built on four interdependent pillars: (1) Verifiability, grounding content in authoritative sources; (2) Stability, ensuring deterministic core knowledge; (3) Auditability, enabling independent institutional validation; and (4) Pedagogical Soundness, enforcing principles of active learning. We argue that trustworthiness stems primarily from systematic architecture, not raw model capability. This insight implies that affordable, open-source models can achieve deployment-grade trust, offering a scalable and equitable path to integrating AI safely into learning environments globally.

TL;DR: 论文探讨全球化背景下教育生态系统中的标准制定，特别是国际标准化组织第36分委员会在远程教育标准制定中的作用


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在全球化背景下，各种技术、工业、社会经济、文化和语言领域都采用标准，但面对复杂的社会文化多样性，需要建立全球透明连贯的系统来确保知识转移和本地适应。教育生态系统尤其需要制定标准来促进知识和价值观的转移。

Method: 聚焦国际标准化组织第36分委员会（ISO SC36），该委员会是教育生态系统的一部分，法语国家参与其中，基于全球共识制定远程教育的国际标准。

Result: 论文强调了在多元文化背景下通过共识机制制定教育标准的重要性，特别是远程教育领域的国际标准制定过程。

Conclusion: 在全球化教育生态系统中，通过国际标准化组织等平台，基于共识制定标准对于确保知识转移的透明性、连贯性和本地适应性至关重要，法语国家参与ISO SC36的工作体现了这一过程。

Abstract: Standards are adopted in a wide range of fields, both technical and industrial, as well as socio-economic, cultural and linguistic. They are presented explicitly as laws and regulations, technical and industrial standards or implicitly in the form of unwritten social standards. However, in a globalization marked by a very fine mosaic of socio-cultural identities, the question arises in relation to the construction of global, transparent and coherent systems in which considerable work of consensus is necessary to ensure all types of transfers and their local adaptations. The focus here is on the global education ecosystem which develops its own standards for the transfer of knowledge and socio-cultural values through learning, teaching and training. Subcommittee 36 of the International Organization for Standardization is one of the structures of this ecosystem in which the Francophonie participates to develop international standards for distance education on the basis of universal consensus.

Motivation: 尽管分布式研究网络（DRNs）和隐私保护分布式算法（PDA）在过去十年中在医疗研究领域得到广泛应用，但在多站点研究中生成高质量真实世界证据仍面临诸多挑战，包括站点内外的异质性偏差和数据共享困难。目前缺乏针对PDA方法开展协作研究的全面指导原则。

Method: 建立隐私保护分布式算法（PDA）研究的十大最佳实践原则，涵盖研究准备、方案制定、分析和最终报告等所有研究阶段，为分布式学习算法在DRNs中的应用提供原则性框架。

Result: 提出了一个原则性、高效且透明的框架，包括十大原则，用于指导在分布式研究网络中使用分布式学习算法生成可靠且可复现的真实世界证据。

Conclusion: 这十大原则为使用隐私保护分布式算法进行高质量多站点研究提供了系统性指导，有助于克服现有挑战，促进可靠真实世界证据的生成，推动分布式研究网络的进一步发展。

Abstract: Background: Distributed Research Networks (DRNs) offer significant opportunities for collaborative multi-site research and have significantly advanced healthcare research based on clinical observational data. However, generating high-quality real-world evidence using fit-for-use data from multi-site studies faces important challenges, including biases associated with various types of heterogeneity within and across sites and data sharing difficulties. Over the last ten years, Privacy-Preserving Distributed Algorithms (PDA) have been developed and utilized in numerous national and international real-world studies spanning diverse domains, from comparative effectiveness research, target trial emulation, to healthcare delivery, policy evaluation, and system performance assessment. Despite these advances, there remains a lack of comprehensive and clear guiding principles for generating high-quality real-world evidence through collaborative studies leveraging the methods under PDA.
  Objective: The paper aims to establish ten principles of best practice for conducting high-quality multi-site studies using PDA. These principles cover all phases of research, including study preparation, protocol development, analysis, and final reporting.
  Discussion: The ten principles for conducting a PDA study outline a principled, efficient, and transparent framework for employing distributed learning algorithms within DRNs to generate reliable and reproducible real-world evidence.

Motivation: 随着深度神经网络和大语言模型的快速规模化，AI组织中"研究"与"工程"的传统界限已经模糊。作者观察到AI实验室和科技公司中不同角色的职责重叠现象，希望通过系统分析揭示这一趋势。

Method: 通过对领先AI实验室和科技公司的公开职位描述、招聘标准和组织叙述进行定性综合研究，提出AI角色连续体框架，分析不同角色的核心能力重叠情况。

Result: 研究发现分布式系统设计、大规模训练与优化、严谨实验和发表导向的研究等核心能力在不同角色间广泛共享。角色流动性缩短了研究到生产的循环，提高了迭代速度，增强了组织学习能力。

Conclusion: 应将AI角色视为连续体而非离散类别，这种流动性对现代AI企业的招聘实践、职业阶梯和人才发展具有重要启示，有助于更有效地组织AI研发工作。

Abstract: The rapid scaling of deep neural networks and large language models has collapsed the once-clear divide between "research" and "engineering" in AI organizations. Drawing on a qualitative synthesis of public job descriptions, hiring criteria, and organizational narratives from leading AI labs and technology companies, we propose the AI Roles Continuum: a framework in which Research Scientists, Research Engineers, Applied Scientists, and Machine Learning Engineers occupy overlapping positions rather than discrete categories. We show that core competencies such as distributed systems design, large-scale training and optimization, rigorous experimentation, and publication-minded inquiry are now broadly shared across titles. Treating roles as fluid rather than siloed shortens research-to-production loops, improves iteration velocity, and strengthens organizational learning. We present a taxonomy of competencies mapped to common roles and discuss implications for hiring practices, career ladders, and workforce development in modern AI enterprises.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球AI教育框架缺乏在南方国家教师教育系统中的具体操作指南，特别是在伦理、文化响应和课程对齐方面的实施方法存在空白。

Method: 采用设计科学研究方法，开发了模拟学校环境的数字基础设施，包含多智能体检索增强对话AI系统，嵌入系统级和交互级双重提示路径。

Result: 系统有效实施了负责任AI原则（透明度、问责制、文化响应等），专家评估显示其教学适用性良好，能促进学生参与同时保持教师专业权威。

Conclusion: GenAITEd Ghana展示了在南方国家实施负责任AI教育的可行性，但需要持续模型整合、专业发展和AI素养教育来减轻过度依赖风险。

Abstract: Global frameworks increasingly advocate for Responsible Artificial Intelligence (AI) in education, yet they provide limited guidance on how ethical, culturally responsive, and curriculum-aligned AI can be operationalized within functioning teacher education systems, particularly in the Global South. This study addresses this gap through the design and evaluation of GenAITEd Ghana, a context-aware, region-specific conversational AI prototype developed to support teacher education in Ghana. Guided by a Design Science Research approach, the system was developed as a school-mimetic digital infrastructure aligned with the organizational logic of Ghanaian Colleges of Education and the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NaCCA) framework. GenAITEd Ghana operates as a multi-agent, retrieval-augmented conversational AI that coordinates multiple models for curriculum-grounded dialogue, automatic speech recognition, voice synthesis, and multimedia interaction. Two complementary prompt pathways were embedded: system-level prompts that enforce curriculum boundaries, ethical constraints, and teacher-in-the-loop oversight, and interaction-level semi-automated prompts that structure live pedagogical dialogue through clarification, confirmation, and guided response generation. Evaluation findings show that the system effectively enacted key Responsible AI principles, including transparency, accountability, cultural responsiveness, privacy, and human oversight. Human expert evaluations further indicated that GenAITEd Ghana is pedagogically appropriate for Ghanaian teacher education, promoting student engagement while preserving educators' professional authority. Identified challenges highlight the need for continued model integration, professional development, and critical AI literacy to mitigate risks of over-reliance.

TL;DR: 开发并验证了教师AI素养的自我报告和客观评估工具，发现两者相关性低，识别出六种不同的能力认知模式，为教师专业发展和学习分析提供诊断工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前K-12教育中AI广泛采用，但缺乏经过心理测量学验证的教师AI素养评估工具。现有研究主要依赖自我报告或客观评估，很少将两者在统一框架下对齐比较，限制了学习分析的可扩展性和学习者画像驱动的教学设计发展。

Method: 在"概念、使用、评估、伦理"框架下开发并评估了教师AI素养的自我报告和客观测量工具。使用验证性因子分析检验构念效度，通过潜在剖面分析识别不同的教师能力认知模式。

Result: 验证性因子分析显示良好的信度和可接受的拟合度，支持构念效度。自我报告和客观评估因素之间相关性低。潜在剖面分析识别出六种不同模式：高估型、低估型、对齐型，以及无AI素养经验教师特有的低自我报告/低客观能力型。

Conclusion: 本研究通过验证共享维度上的自我报告和客观测量工具，扩展了现有AI素养框架。这些工具可作为教师专业发展的诊断工具，支持AI知情决策（如成长监测、需求画像），并实现针对教师子群体的可扩展学习分析干预。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in K-12 education highlights the need for psychometrically-tested measures of teachers' AI literacy. Existing work has primarily relied on either self-report (SR) or objective-based (OB) assessments, with few studies aligning the two within a shared framework to compare perceived versus demonstrated competencies or examine how prior AI literacy experience shapes this relationship. This gap limits the scalability of learning analytics and the development of learner profile-driven instructional design. In this study, we developed and evaluated SR and OB measures of teacher AI literacy within the established framework of Concept, Use, Evaluate, and Ethics. Confirmatory factor analyses support construct validity with good reliability and acceptable fit. Results reveal a low correlation between SR and OB factors. Latent profile analysis identified six distinct profiles, including overestimation (SR > OB), underestimation (SR < OB), alignment (SR close to OB), and a unique low-SR/low-OB profile among teachers without AI literacy experience. Theoretically, this work extends existing AI literacy frameworks by validating SR and OB measures on shared dimensions. Practically, the instruments function as diagnostic tools for professional development, supporting AI-informed decisions (e.g., growth monitoring, needs profiling) and enabling scalable learning analytics interventions tailored to teacher subgroups.

Motivation: 生成式AI工具在教育中日益普及，但许多教育工作者缺乏负责任和情境敏感的提示工程指导，特别是在非洲等资源受限环境中。需要为教育工作者和研究人员提供伦理应用提示工程的能力建设。

Method: 通过GenAI-ERA组织的三天在线专业发展项目，采用分层渐进方法：从基础提示设计到应用和伦理策略，包括角色引导互动。收集注册调查、网络研讨会互动记录、促进者观察和会议记录等数据，使用描述性统计和计算支持的定性技术进行分析。

Result: 468名参与者（包括大学教育工作者、研究生和研究人员）参与项目。研究发现参与者逐渐将提示工程概念化为需要伦理意识、情境敏感性和教学判断的AI素养，而非单纯技术技能。同时发现与访问、本地相关培训材料和机构支持相关的持续挑战。

Conclusion: 建议持续的专业发展，并将提示素养纳入课程，以支持非洲教育系统中负责任的生成式AI使用。强调需要解决访问障碍、开发本地相关材料并加强机构支持。

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools are increasingly adopted in education, yet many educators lack structured guidance on responsible and context sensitive prompt engineering, particularly in African and other resource constrained settings. This case report documents a three day online professional development programme organised by Generative AI for Education and Research in Africa (GenAI-ERA), designed to strengthen educators and researchers capacity to apply prompt engineering ethically for academic writing, teaching, and research. The programme engaged 468 participants across multiple African countries, including university educators, postgraduate students, and researchers. The training followed a scaffolded progression from foundational prompt design to applied and ethical strategies, including persona guided interactions. Data sources comprised registration surveys, webinar interaction records, facilitator observations, and session transcripts, analysed using descriptive statistics and computationally supported qualitative techniques. Findings indicate that participants increasingly conceptualised prompt engineering as a form of AI literacy requiring ethical awareness, contextual sensitivity, and pedagogical judgement rather than technical skill alone. The case highlights persistent challenges related to access, locally relevant training materials, and institutional support. The report recommends sustained professional development and the integration of prompt literacy into curricula to support responsible GenAI use in African education systems.

Method: 构建包含9,978个埃及职位、19,766项技能活动和84,346个职位-技能关系的知识图谱（错误率0.74%），分析自动化风险岗位工人的转型路径可行性

Result: 20.9%的岗位面临高自动化风险，但仅24.4%的高风险工人有可行转型路径（需≥3项共享技能且技能转移率≥50%）。在4,534个可行转型中，流程导向技能在15.6%的路径中起关键作用

Conclusion: 大多数面临自动化风险的工人面临结构性流动障碍，需要全面再培训而非渐进式技能提升。新兴经济体需要主动创造转型路径，而非被动技能匹配

Abstract: How many workers displaced by automation can realistically transition to safer jobs? We answer this using a validated knowledge graph of 9,978 Egyptian job postings, 19,766 skill activities, and 84,346 job-skill relationships (0.74% error rate). While 20.9% of jobs face high automation risk, we find that only 24.4% of at-risk workers have viable transition pathways--defined by $\geq$3 shared skills and $\geq$50% skill transfer. The remaining 75.6% face a structural mobility barrier requiring comprehensive reskilling, not incremental upskilling. Among 4,534 feasible transitions, process-oriented skills emerge as the highest-leverage intervention, appearing in 15.6% of pathways. These findings challenge optimistic narratives of seamless workforce adaptation and demonstrate that emerging economies require active pathway creation, not passive skill matching.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 媒体政治偏见影响公众舆论和民主进程，自动化检测偏见可限制选举偏见。随着LLM在政治和媒体研究中的重要性提升，本研究旨在利用LLM量化分析主流媒体的政治立场倾向。

Method: 使用BERT、Gemini和DeepSeek三种LLM模型，分析《卫报》和BBC关于俄乌战争和哈马斯-以色列冲突的新闻报道，比较左翼、右翼和中立政治观点的比例分布。

Result: 战争爆发后西方媒体政治偏见向左翼倾斜；DeepSeek检测显示稳定的左倾倾向，BERT和Gemini更接近中立；BBC和《卫报》在两场冲突中表现不同：俄乌战争中立场相对稳定，以色列-哈马斯冲突中《卫报》政治偏见变化更大，呈现事件驱动模式。

Conclusion: LLM的检测结果不仅受训练数据和架构影响，还反映了其内在世界观和政治偏见；媒体偏见具有事件驱动特性，不同冲突中报道立场存在差异。

Abstract: Political bias in media plays a critical role in shaping public opinion, voter behaviour, and broader democratic discourse. Subjective opinions and political bias can be found in media sources, such as newspapers, depending on their funding mechanisms and alliances with political parties. Automating the detection of political biases in media content can limit biases in elections. The impact of large language models (LLMs) in politics and media studies is becoming prominent. In this study, we utilise LLMs to compare the left-wing, right-wing, and neutral political opinions expressed in the Guardian and BBC. We review newspaper reporting that includes significant events such as the Russia-Ukraine war and the Hamas-Israel conflict. We analyse the proportion for each opinion to find the bias under different LLMs, including BERT, Gemini, and DeepSeek. Our results show that after the outbreak of the wars, the political bias of Western media shifts towards the left-wing and each LLM gives a different result. DeepSeek consistently showed a stable Left-leaning tendency, while BERT and Gemini remained closer to the Centre. The BBC and The Guardian showed distinct reporting behaviours across the two conflicts. In the Russia-Ukraine war, both outlets maintained relatively stable positions; however, in the Israel-Hamas conflict, we identified larger political bias shifts, particularly in Guardian coverage, suggesting a more event-driven pattern of reporting bias. These variations suggest that LLMs are shaped not only by their training data and architecture, but also by underlying worldviews with associated political biases.

Motivation: 探索如何通过新闻游戏设计教学，让工程学生在学习游戏设计技术的同时，培养信息素养、批判性思维和表达能力

Method: 2010-2012年间，在游戏设计入门课程中引入新闻游戏创作，约80名学生使用RPG Maker、The Games Factory 2、Flash、Java等工具，基于在线新闻资源创作了17个关于时事话题的游戏

Result: 新闻游戏设计促进了三方面学习成果：1）深入信息检索和现实问题文档化；2）通过同一事件不同游戏解读促进观点交流；3）课堂辩论游戏作为敏感话题表达媒介的合法性和局限性

Conclusion: 新闻游戏设计能支持推理能力发展（基于证据的论证和视角转换），建议将这种方法扩展到其他严肃游戏类型以进一步探索其教育潜力

Abstract: This chapter reports an empirical teaching experience integrating newsgame creation-serious games addressing current events and contributing to public debate-into an introductory game design course for engineering students. From 2010 to 2012, around 80 students produced 17 games on diverse news topics (e.g., H1N1 influenza, Megaupload shutdown, Tunisian Revolution, Haiti earthquake), relying on online journalistic sources and using accessible development tools suited to mixed programming backgrounds (RPG Maker, The Games Factory 2, Flash, Java). The authors argue that designing newsgames fosters learning outcomes beyond technical design skills: (1) thorough information seeking and documentation of real-world issues, (2) exchange and confrontation of viewpoints through contrasting game interpretations of the same event, and (3) classroom debates about the legitimacy and limits of video games as an expressive medium for sensitive topics. The paper concludes that newsgame design can support the development of reasoning skills (evidence-based argumentation and perspective-taking) and suggests extending the approach to other serious game types to further explore its educational potential.

Abstract: Providing timely, consistent, and high-quality feedback in large-scale higher education courses remains a persistent challenge, often constrained by instructor workload and resource limitations. This study presents an LLM-powered, agentic assessment system built on a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture to address these challenges. The system integrates a large language model with a structured retrieval mechanism that accesses rubric criteria, exemplar essays, and instructor feedback to generate contextually grounded grades and formative comments. A mixed-methods evaluation was conducted using 701 student essays, combining quantitative analyses of inter-rater reliability, scoring alignment, and consistency with instructor assessments, alongside qualitative evaluation of feedback quality, pedagogical relevance, and student support. Results demonstrate that the RAG system can produce reliable, rubric-aligned feedback at scale, achieving 94--99% agreement with human evaluators, while also enhancing students' opportunities for self-regulated learning and engagement with assessment criteria. The discussion highlights both pedagogical limitations, including potential constraints on originality and feedback dialogue, and the transformative potential of RAG systems to augment instructors' capabilities, streamline assessment workflows, and support scalable, adaptive learning environments. This research contributes empirical evidence for the application of agentic AI in higher education, offering a scalable and pedagogically informed model for enhancing feedback accessibility, consistency, and quality.

Conclusion: 要实现医疗AI技术的临床转化，需要在患者利益与行业利益之间建立平衡，通过提高透明度、建立以患者为中心的合作伙伴关系、优先考虑整体医疗效益，才能实现临床医生使用的有意义的AI技术，达到患者与行业的双赢。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare has led to many promising developments; however, increasingly, AI research is funded by the private sector leading to potential trade-offs between benefits to patients and benefits to industry. Health AI practitioners should prioritize successful adaptation into clinical practice in order to provide meaningful benefits to patients, but translation usually requires collaboration with industry. We discuss three features of AI studies that hamper the integration of AI into clinical practice from the perspective of researchers and clinicians. These include lack of clinically relevant metrics, lack of clinical trials and longitudinal studies to validate results, and lack of patient and physician involvement in the development process. For partnerships between industry and health research to be sustainable, a balance must be established between patient and industry benefit. We propose three approaches for addressing this gap: improved transparency and explainability of AI models, fostering relationships with industry partners that have a reputation for centering patient benefit in their practices, and prioritization of overall healthcare benefits.

Abstract: The artificial intelligence (AI) digital divide in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) presents significant disparities in AI access, adoption, and development due to varying levels of infrastructure, education, and policy support. This study investigates the extent of AI readiness among the top SSA countries using the 2024 Government AI Readiness Index, alongside an analysis of AI initiatives to foster inclusivity. A comparative analysis of AI readiness scores highlights disparities across nations, with Mauritius (53.94) and South Africa (52.91) leading, while Zambia (42.58) and Uganda (43.32) lag. Quartile analysis reveals a concentration of AI preparedness among a few nations, suggesting uneven AI development. The study further examines the relationship between AI readiness and economic indicators, identifying instances where AI progress does not strictly correlate with Gross Domestic Product per capita, as seen in Rwanda and Uganda. Using case studies of AI initiatives across SSA, this research contextualises quantitative findings, identifying key strategies contributing to AI inclusivity, including talent development programs, research networks, and policy interventions. The study concludes with recommendations to bridge the AI digital divide, emphasising investments in AI education, localised AI solutions, and cross-country collaborations to accelerate AI adoption in SSA.

Abstract: This policy report draws on country studies from China, South Korea, Singapore, and the United Kingdom to identify effective tools and key barriers to interoperability in AI safety governance. It offers practical recommendations to support a globally informed yet locally grounded governance ecosystem. Interoperability is a central goal of AI governance, vital for reducing risks, fostering innovation, enhancing competitiveness, promoting standardization, and building public trust. However, structural gaps such as fragmented regulations and lack of global coordination, and conceptual gaps, including limited Global South engagement, continue to hinder progress. Focusing on three high-stakes domains - autonomous vehicles, education, and cross-border data flows - the report compares ethical, legal, and technical frameworks across the four countries. It identifies areas of convergence, divergence, and potential alignment, offering policy recommendations that support the development of interoperability mechanisms aligned with the Global Digital Compact and relevant UN resolutions. The analysis covers seven components: objectives, regulators, ethics, binding measures, targeted frameworks, technical standards, and key risks.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 论文提出从个人AI使用转向集体智能教学法，通过生成式AI促进同伴学习，在工程课堂中实施生成式集体智能活动，结合思考惯例和策略性AI咨询，增强学生协作与深度学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前工程课堂中生成式AI的使用主要局限于个人提示和孤立辅助，这种狭隘框架可能加剧教育不平等，只奖励已有特权或积极的学生。需要转向更集体化的教学法，利用AI促进同伴学习。

Method: 在两个本科工程课程中实施生成式集体智能活动，涉及140名学生。使用哈佛零点项目开发的思考惯例（如问题分类、剥开果实），结合策略性AI咨询，让学生外化推理、比较解释、迭代完善想法。采用学习科学、集体智能、具身认知和技术哲学的多学科方法，并通过学生调查和参与观察进行实证研究。

Result: 学生重视人类协作与策略性AI支持的结合，认识到过度依赖AI的风险，同时欣赏AI扩展视角的作用。学生发现小组工作比单独使用AI能培养更深层次理解和创造性问题解决能力，AI咨询的时机显著影响学习成果。

Conclusion: 提出实践实施路径，将集体智能教学法主流化，培养更深层次的参与度、弹性问题解决能力和知识共享所有权。生成式AI应作为同伴学习的催化剂，而非孤立工具。

Abstract: Engineering classrooms are increasingly experimenting with generative AI (GenAI), but most uses remain confined to individual prompting and isolated assistance. This narrow framing risks reinforcing equity gaps and only rewarding the already privileged or motivated students. We argue instead for a shift toward collective intelligence (CI)-focused pedagogy, where GenAI acts as a catalyst for peer-to-peer learning. We implemented Generative CI (GCI) activities in two undergraduate engineering courses, engaging 140 students through thinking routines -- short, repeatable scaffolds developed by Harvard Project Zero to make thinking visible and support collaborative sense-making. Using routines such as Question Sorts and Peel the Fruit, combined with strategic AI consultation, we enabled students to externalize their reasoning, compare interpretations, and iteratively refine ideas. Our dual-pronged approach synthesizes literature from learning sciences, CI, embodied cognition, and philosophy of technology, while also empirically learning through student surveys and engagement observations. Results demonstrate that students value the combination of human collaboration with strategic AI support, recognizing risks of over-reliance while appreciating AI's role in expanding perspectives. Students identified that group work fosters deeper understanding and creative problem-solving than AI alone, with the timing of AI consultation significantly affecting learning outcomes. We offer practical implementation pathways for mainstreaming CI-focused pedagogy that cultivates deeper engagement, resilient problem-solving, and shared ownership of knowledge.

TL;DR: 论文综合了自动化心理学、人因工程、HCI和技术哲学四个研究传统，建立了一个理解学习者如何心理上对待拟人化AI导师的框架，识别了生成式AI加剧的三个挑战，并通过YouTube评论分析验证了理论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI导师正以前所未有的速度进入课堂，但其部署速度超过了我们对这种技术心理和社会后果的理解。然而，自动化心理学、人因工程和人机交互等领域数十年的研究提供了关键见解，但在教育AI设计中仍未充分利用。

Method: 1. 综合四个研究传统（自动化心理学、人因工程、HCI、技术哲学）建立理论框架；2. 识别生成式AI加剧的三个心理挑战；3. 通过比较分析超过104,984条YouTube评论（AI生成的哲学辩论与人类创建的工程教程）进行实证验证。

Result: 1. 识别了三个关键挑战：双重信任校准失败（自动化偏见和算法厌恶）、拟人化设计的负面影响、自动化悖论；2. YouTube分析显示领域依赖的信任模式和强烈的拟人化投射；3. 为工程教育提出差异化方法：AI辅导技术基础，人类指导设计伦理和专业判断。

Conclusion: AI导师的设计需要更细致地考虑心理和社会影响。对于工程教育，应采取差异化方法：AI适合技术基础教学（通过适当支架管理自动化偏见），而人类指导在需要隐性知识传递的设计、伦理和专业判断领域不可替代。

Abstract: As AI tutors enter classrooms at unprecedented speed, their deployment increasingly outpaces our grasp of the psychological and social consequences of such technology. Yet decades of research in automation psychology, human factors, and human-computer interaction provide crucial insights that remain underutilized in educational AI design. This work synthesizes four research traditions -- automation psychology, human factors engineering, HCI, and philosophy of technology -- to establish a comprehensive framework for understanding how learners psychologically relate to anthropomorphic AI tutors. We identify three persistent challenges intensified by Generative AI's conversational fluency. First, learners exhibit dual trust calibration failures -- automation bias (uncritical acceptance) and algorithm aversion (excessive rejection after errors) -- with an expertise paradox where novices overrely while experts underrely. Second, while anthropomorphic design enhances engagement, it can distract from learning and foster harmful emotional attachment. Third, automation ironies persist: systems meant to aid cognition introduce designer errors, degrade skills through disuse, and create monitoring burdens humans perform poorly. We ground this theoretical synthesis through comparative analysis of over 104,984 YouTube comments across AI-generated philosophical debates and human-created engineering tutorials, revealing domain-dependent trust patterns and strong anthropomorphic projection despite minimal cues. For engineering education, our synthesis mandates differentiated approaches: AI tutoring for technical foundations where automation bias is manageable through proper scaffolding, but human facilitation for design, ethics, and professional judgment where tacit knowledge transmission proves irreplaceable.

Motivation: 科技行业将AI宣传为解决环境危机的关键工具，但数据中心排放量随AI发展快速增长。行业声称AI排放可接受，因为它能帮助其他行业脱碳，但这些相互矛盾的主张缺乏量化依据，需要澄清AI的净环境影响。

Method: 采用自上而下的方法分析AI直接环境影响：从ICT整体到数据中心，再到AI开发和部署各阶段；引入评估AI直接和间接影响的框架；最后提出减少AI影响的最佳实践。

Result: 报告提供了量化AI环境影响的系统方法，包括透明度问题、市场预期干扰、缺乏标准化方法等挑战的解决方案，为评估AI净环境影响提供了清晰框架。

Conclusion: AI的环境影响需要系统评估，不能简单接受"以排放换减排"的说法。报告提供了量化框架和实践建议，帮助行业在追求AI发展的同时减少其环境足迹。

Abstract: The technology industry promotes artificial intelligence (AI) as a key enabler to solve a vast number of problems, including the environmental crisis. However, when looking at the emissions of datacenters from worldwide service providers, we observe a rapid increase aligned with the advent of AI. Some actors justify it by claiming that the increase of emissions for digital infrastructures is acceptable as it could help the decarbonization of other sectors, e.g., videoconference tools instead of taking the plane for a meeting abroad, or using AI to optimize and reduce energy consumption. With such conflicting claims and ambitions, it is unclear how the net environmental impact of AI could be quantified. The answer is prone to uncertainty for different reasons, among others: lack of transparency, interference with market expectations, lack of standardized methodology for quantifying direct and indirect impact, and the quick evolutions of models and their requirements.
  This report provides answers and clarifications to these different elements. Firstly, we consider the direct environmental impact of AI from a top-down approach, starting from general information and communication technologies (ICT) and then zooming in on data centers and the different phases of AI development and deployment. Secondly, a framework is introduced on how to assess both the direct and indirect impact of AI. Finally, we finish with good practices and what we can do to reduce AI impact.

Abstract: Establishing frameworks for promoting the realization of various activities on celestial bodies sustainably is of great significance for different contexts, such as preserving the scientific evidence and space heritage. Therefore, this research first proposes a conceptual model that covers the different types of features, attributes, and relationships between them to comprehensively delineate the surface objects and related logical spaces on celestial bodies. It then implements this conceptual model as a CityJSON extension in such a way that allows for creating the three-dimensional (3D) geodatasets that represent these objects and spaces in a standardized manner. Moreover, the usefulness of this study is demonstrated through creating CityJSON datasets that include 3D models of exemplary surface objects from Moon and Mars, such as a historical landing site and related logical spaces, such as exclusion zones for protecting this site. The results of the current study show that there is a strong potential for forming 3D geodatasets on celestial bodies that can provide a notable foundation for the technical implementation of international agreements and legal frameworks. This work also contributes to the design of planetary spatial data infrastructures (PSDI) by incorporating the third dimension.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型越来越多地参与社会决策，理解其政治立场和对齐行为对安全性和公平性至关重要。

Method: 采用社会技术审计方法，使用三种心理测量工具（Political Compass、SapplyValues、8 Values）评估模型政治立场，并在大规模新闻标注任务（N≈27,000）上测试模型表现。

Result: 96.3%的模型聚集在自由左翼区域；对齐信号是稳定的架构特征而非随机噪声；开源与闭源模型在文化进步主义得分上存在显著差异；新闻分析中模型存在系统性"中心偏移"，将中性文章归类为左倾，且对"极左"内容的识别准确率（19.2%）远高于"极右"内容（2.0%）。

Conclusion: 单轴评估不足，需要多维审计框架来准确表征部署大语言模型的对齐行为。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into social decision-making, understanding their political positioning and alignment behavior is critical for safety and fairness. This study presents a sociotechnical audit of 26 prominent LLMs, triangulating their positions across three psychometric inventories (Political Compass, SapplyValues, 8 Values) and evaluating their performance on a large-scale news labeling task ($N \approx 27{,}000$). Our results reveal a strong clustering of models in the Libertarian-Left region of the ideological space, encompassing 96.3% of the cohort. Alignment signals appear to be consistent architectural traits rather than stochastic noise ($η^2 > 0.90$); however, we identify substantial discrepancies in measurement validity. In particular, the Political Compass exhibits a strong negative correlation with cultural progressivism ($r=-0.64$) when compared against multi-axial instruments, suggesting a conflation of social conservatism with authoritarianism in this context. We further observe a significant divergence between open-weights and closed-source models, with the latter displaying markedly higher cultural progressivism scores ($p<10^{-25}$). In downstream media analysis, models exhibit a systematic "center-shift," frequently categorizing neutral articles as left-leaning, alongside an asymmetric detection capability in which "Far Left" content is identified with greater accuracy (19.2%) than "Far Right" content (2.0%). These findings suggest that single-axis evaluations are insufficient and that multidimensional auditing frameworks are necessary to characterize alignment behavior in deployed LLMs. Our code and data will be made public.

Abstract: Causal relationships play a pivotal role in research within the field of public administration. Ensuring reliable causal inference requires validating the predictability of these relationships, which is a crucial precondition. However, prediction has not garnered adequate attention within the realm of quantitative research in public administration and the broader social sciences. The advent of interpretable machine learning presents a significant opportunity to integrate prediction into quantitative research conducted in public administration. This article delves into the fundamental principles of interpretable machine learning while also examining its current applications in social science research. Building upon this foundation, the article further expounds upon the implementation process of interpretable machine learning, encompassing key aspects such as dataset construction, model training, model evaluation, and model interpretation. Lastly, the article explores the disciplinary value of interpretable machine learning within the field of public administration, highlighting its potential to enhance the generalization of inference, facilitate the selection of optimal explanations for phenomena, stimulate the construction of theoretical hypotheses, and provide a platform for the translation of knowledge. As a complement to traditional causal inference methods, interpretable machine learning ushers in a new era of credibility in quantitative research within the realm of public administration.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have precipitated a dramatic improvement in the legal domain, yet the deployment of standalone models faces significant limitations regarding hallucination, outdated information, and verifiability. Recently, LLM agents have attracted significant attention as a solution to these challenges, utilizing advanced capabilities such as planning, memory, and tool usage to meet the rigorous standards of legal practice. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of LLM agents for legal tasks, analyzing how these architectures bridge the gap between technical capabilities and domain-specific needs. Our major contributions include: (1) systematically analyzing the technical transition from standard legal LLMs to legal agents; (2) presenting a structured taxonomy of current agent applications across distinct legal practice areas; (3) discussing evaluation methodologies specifically for agentic performance in law; and (4) identifying open challenges and outlining future directions for developing robust and autonomous legal assistants.

Abstract: This paper presents a conceptual and operational framework for developing and operating safe and trustworthy AI agents based on a Three-Pillar Model grounded in transparency, accountability, and trustworthiness. Building on prior work in Human-in-the-Loop systems, reinforcement learning, and collaborative AI, the framework defines an evolutionary path toward autonomous agents that balances increasing automation with appropriate human oversight. The paper argues that safe agent autonomy must be achieved through progressive validation, analogous to the staged development of autonomous driving, rather than through immediate full automation. Transparency and accountability are identified as foundational requirements for establishing user trust and for mitigating known risks in generative AI systems, including hallucinations, data bias, and goal misalignment, such as the inversion problem. The paper further describes three ongoing work streams supporting this framework: public deliberation on AI agents conducted by the Stanford Deliberative Democracy Lab, cross-industry collaboration through the Safe AI Agent Consortium, and the development of open tooling for an agent operating environment aligned with the Three-Pillar Model. Together, these contributions provide both conceptual clarity and practical guidance for enabling the responsible evolution of AI agents that operate transparently, remain aligned with human values, and sustain societal trust.

Conclusion: 针对不同年级水平量身定制的AI辅助学习有潜力推进教育参与度和公平性

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising solution to complement traditional teaching and address global teacher shortages that affect hundreds of millions of children, but they fail to provide grade-appropriate responses for students at different educational levels. We introduce a framework for finetuning LLMs to generate age-appropriate educational content across six grade levels, from lower elementary to adult education. Our framework successfully adapts explanations to match students' comprehension capacities without sacrificing factual correctness. This approach integrates seven established readability metrics through a clustering method and builds a comprehensive dataset for grade-specific content generation. Evaluations across multiple datasets with 208 human participants demonstrate substantial improvements in grade-level alignment, achieving a 35.64 percentage point increase compared to prompt-based methods while maintaining response accuracy. AI-assisted learning tailored to different grade levels has the potential to advance educational engagement and equity.

Motivation: 执法机构面临大量犯罪数据，机器学习系统在实践中经常失败，需要将系统行为与利益相关者目标对齐，因此需要在开发早期使用目标导向需求工程方法。

Method: 应用KAOS框架进行需求工程，包括目标细化、对象建模、代理分配和操作化，特别关注数据获取在系统设计中的核心作用。

Result: 发现目标、数据和机器学习性能之间存在迭代、双向的依赖关系，数据需求约束细化选择并影响目标链接和满足方式，同时目标细化和代理分配也影响数据质量期望。

Conclusion: 提出了将GORE与数据驱动系统开发集成的参考模型，识别了KAOS在数据获取和质量管理方面的不足，为高风险社会背景下的ML系统开发提供指导。

Abstract: Investigating serious crimes is inherently complex and resource-constrained. Law enforcement agencies (LEAs) grapple with overwhelming volumes of offender and incident data, making effective suspect identification difficult. Although machine learning (ML)-enabled systems have been explored to support LEAs, several have failed in practice. This highlights the need to align system behavior with stakeholder goals early in development, motivating the use of Goal-Oriented Requirements Engineering (GORE).
  This paper reports our experience applying the GORE framework KAOS to designing an ML-enabled system for identifying suspects in online child sexual abuse. We describe how KAOS supported early requirements elaboration, including goal refinement, object modeling, agent assignment, and operationalization. A key finding is the central role of data elicitation: data requirements constrain refinement choices and candidate agents while influencing how goals are linked, operationalized, and satisfied. Conversely, goal elaboration and agent assignment shape data quality expectations and collection needs.
  Our experience highlights the iterative, bidirectional dependencies between goals, data, and ML performance. We contribute a reference model for integrating GORE with data-driven system development, and identify gaps in KAOS, particularly the need for explicit support for data elicitation and quality management. These insights inform future extensions of KAOS and, more broadly, the application of formal GORE methods to ML-enabled systems for high-stakes societal contexts.

Method: 提出FairSCOSCA系统，包含两个基于多种规范性公平定义的设计改进：1）结合累积等待时间的绿灯相位优化；2）未充分利用绿灯相位的提前终止

Result: 在德国埃斯林根动脉网络的校准微观模拟案例研究中，FairSCOSCA在多个公平维度（平等主义、罗尔斯主义、功利主义和哈桑尼主义）上显著改善，同时不牺牲交通效率，相比固定周期、最大压力和标准SCOOTS/SCATS控制器，显著减少了过度等待时间、延误不平等和主干道与支路之间的横向歧视

Conclusion: 该研究通过弥合公平理论与全球部署信号系统的实际改进之间的差距，为公平交通控制文献做出贡献，开源实现已在GitHub上提供

Abstract: Traffic signal control at intersections, especially in arterial networks, is a key lever for mitigating the growing issue of traffic congestion in cities. Despite the widespread deployment of SCOOTS and SCATS, which prioritize efficiency, fairness has remained largely absent from their design logic, often resulting in unfair outcomes for certain road users, such as excessive waiting times. Fairness however, is a major driver of public acceptance for implementation of new controll systems. Therefore, this work proposes FairSCOSCA, a fairness-enhancing extension to these systems, featuring two novel yet practical design adaptations grounded in multiple normative fairness definitions: (1) green phase optimization incorporating cumulative waiting times, and (2) early termination of underutilized green phases. Those extensions ensure fairer distributions of green times. Evaluated in a calibrated microsimulation case study of the arterial network in Esslingen am Neckar (Germany), FairSCOSCA demonstrates substantial improvements across multiple fairness dimensions (Egalitarian, Rawlsian, Utilitarian, and Harsanyian) without sacrificing traffic efficiency. Compared against Fixed-Cycle, Max-Pressure, and standard SCOOTS/SCATS controllers, FairSCOSCA significantly reduces excessive waiting times, delay inequality and horizontal discrimination between arterial and feeder roads. This work contributes to the growing literature on equitable traffic control by bridging the gap between fairness theory and the practical enhancement of globally deployed signal systems. Open source implementation available on GitHub.

TL;DR: C-EQ-ALINEA：一种去中心化、协调且公平的匝道控制扩展方法，在保持ALINEA简单性的同时显著改善延迟分布的公平性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统匝道控制方法导致匝道间延迟分布不均，影响用户接受度和长期可持续性。现有公平感知方法依赖集中式优化、复杂交通模型或数据密集型学习框架，限制了在实际系统（特别是基于ALINEA的遗留系统）中的应用。

Method: 提出C-EQ-ALINEA，作为经典ALINEA反馈控制器的去中心化、协调且公平感知的扩展。通过相邻匝道间的轻量级信息交换实现本地协调，平衡拥堵影响，无需集中控制、额外基础设施或复杂优化。该方法考虑了Harsanyian、Egalitarian、Rawlsian和Aristotelian等多种公平视角。

Result: 在阿姆斯特丹A10环路的24小时微观模拟（SUMO）中评估，结果显示C-EQ-ALINEA显著改善了匝道和用户间的延迟分布公平性，同时保持（在某些配置下甚至超越）了METALINE等现有协调策略的效率。

Conclusion: 通过最小化算法扩展即可实现有意义的公平性提升，为可持续且社会可接受的高速公路运营提供了实用且可扩展的路径。该方法保持了ALINEA的简单性和鲁棒性，具有实际部署潜力。

Abstract: Ramp metering is a widely deployed traffic management strategy for improving freeway efficiency, yet conventional approaches often lead to highly uneven delay distributions across on-ramps, undermining user acceptance and long-term sustainability. While existing fairness-aware ramp metering methods can mitigate such disparities, they typically rely on centralized optimization, detailed traffic models, or data-intensive learning frameworks, limiting their real-world applicability, particularly in networks operating legacy ALINEA-based systems. This paper proposes C-EQ-ALINEA, a decentralized, coordinated, and equity-aware extension of the classical ALINEA feedback controller. The approach introduces lightweight information exchange among neighbouring ramps, enabling local coordination that balances congestion impacts without centralized control, additional infrastructure, or complex optimization. C-EQ-ALINEA preserves the simplicity and robustness of ALINEA while explicitly addressing multiple notions of fairness, including Harsanyian, Egalitarian, Rawlsian, and Aristotelian perspectives. The method is evaluated in a calibrated 24-hour microsimulation of Amsterdam's A10 ring road using SUMO. Results demonstrate that C-EQ-ALINEA substantially improves the equity of delay distributions across ramps and users, while maintaining (in several configurations surpassing) the efficiency of established coordinated strategies such as METALINE. These findings indicate that meaningful fairness gains can be achieved through minimal algorithmic extensions to widely deployed controllers, offering a practical and scalable pathway toward sustainable and socially acceptable freeway operations. Open source implementation available on GitHub.

*Ha-Chi Tran*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 该研究提出"技术摇摆国"概念，探讨中等强国如何利用人工智能的不透明性作为战略资源，通过延迟对冲、选择性结盟和规范中介三种策略，在大国技术竞争中保持战略灵活性并影响全球AI治理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究过于关注中美超级大国的技术竞争策略，忽视了中等强国作为自主行为体在塑造技术秩序中的作用。美中竞争导致技术民族主义、供应链安全化和标准竞争加剧，形成了"武器化相互依存"的格局，模糊了民用与军事边界。需要理解中等强国如何在这种环境下利用技术不透明性来发挥影响力。

Method: 研究提出"技术摇摆国"理论框架，将AI不透明性重新概念化为结构性特征和战略资源（而非技术缺陷）。通过韩国、新加坡和印度的案例研究，分析这些国家如何利用不透明性与制度透明性的相互作用，采用三种策略：延迟对冲、选择性结盟和规范中介。

Result: 技术摇摆国能够利用AI的结构性不透明性，将技术约束转化为战略政治机会。通过三种策略，它们能够保持战略灵活性、在不同利益相关者间建立信任、在竞争性治理制度间促成融合，从而影响全球AI治理的制度设计、国家间谈判和政策结果。

Conclusion: 中等强国在美中技术竞争中并非被动旁观者，而是能够利用AI不透明性作为战略资源的自主行为体。技术摇摆国通过制度机制（如认证、审计、披露）将技术不透明性转化为政治机会，在全球技术治理中发挥重要的中介和调节作用，挑战了传统的大国中心分析框架。

Abstract: The U.S. - China rivalry has placed frontier dual-use technologies, particularly Artificial Intelligence (AI), at the center of global power dynamics, as techno-nationalism, supply chain securitization, and competing standards deepen bifurcation within a weaponized interdependence that blurs civilian-military boundaries. Existing research, yet, mostly emphasizes superpower strategies and often overlooks the role of middle powers as autonomous actors shaping the techno-order. This study examines Technological Swing States (TSS), middle powers with both technological capacity and strategic flexibility, and their ability to navigate the frontier technologies' uncertainty and opacity to mediate great-power techno-competition regionally and globally. It reconceptualizes AI opacity not as a technical deficit, but as a structural feature and strategic resource, stemming from algorithmic complexity, political incentives that prioritize performance over explainability, and the limits of post-hoc interpretability. This structural opacity shifts authority from technical demands for explainability to institutional mechanisms, such as certification, auditing, and disclosure, converting technical constraints into strategic political opportunities. Drawing on case studies of South Korea, Singapore, and India, the paper theorizes how TSS exploit the interplay between opacity and institutional transparency through three strategies: (i) delay and hedging, (ii) selective alignment, and (iii) normative intermediation. These practices enable TSS to preserve strategic flexibility, build trust among diverse stakeholders, and broker convergence across competing governance regimes, thereby influencing institutional design, interstate bargaining, and policy outcomes in global AI governance.

Motivation: 解决高等教育机构中教室分配的挑战，特别关注残障人士(PwDs)的无障碍需求，改善当前手动分配方式的效率不足和无障碍问题

Method: 采用整数线性规划(ILP)优化模型，使用Gurobi求解器，通过权重参数α平衡教室使用数量最小化与残障学生分配到一楼教室的优先级

Result: 实验结果表明，调整α参数可以找到平衡点，显著改善当前手动分配实践，减少所需教室数量和无障碍惩罚，提高运营效率

Conclusion: 优化方法可以提高学术机构的运营效率，同时为所有学生创造更包容的环境；未来工作可将模型扩展到其他部门和情境，整合更多标准

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of classroom allocation in higher education institutions, with an explicit emphasis on accessibility for Persons with Disabilities (PwDs). Employing a case study of a university's computer science department, the paper proposes an Integer Linear Programming (ILP)-based optimization model, which is solved using the Gurobi solver. The objective is to minimize the number of classrooms used by prioritizing the assignment of PwD students to ground-floor classrooms to reduce accessibility barriers. The model is calibrated with a weighting parameter, alpha, that allows for a balance between spatial efficiency and promoting accessibility. Experimental results indicate that adjusting alpha can achieve a balance point that significantly improves current manual allocation practices, reducing the number of classrooms required and accessibility penalties. The findings suggest that optimization methods can improve operational efficiency in academic institutions while promoting a more inclusive environment for all students. Future work may expand the application of the model to other departments and contexts and integrate additional criteria to develop a more holistic approach.

### [162] [The Case for Strategic Data Stewardship: Re-imagining Data Governance to Make Responsible Data Re-use Possible](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06687)
*Stefaan Verhulst*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 论文提出"战略数据管理"作为补充现有数据治理模式的制度功能，旨在系统、可持续、负责任地激活数据创造公共价值，解决当前数据获取受限的"数据寒冬"问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社会挑战日益复杂，但公共利益数据获取却愈发受限，形成"数据寒冬"。现有数据治理模式（合规、风险管理、内部控制）虽必要但不足，导致数据技术上可用但实际难获取、法律上可共享但制度上难使用、社会合法性不足。数据集中在少数行为者手中，成本上升，合作受限。

Method: 提出战略数据管理作为补充制度功能，关注跨部门数据重用、减少错失机会、建立生态系统级合作。制定核心原则、功能和能力，并引入实用的"数据管理画布"工具，支持在数据协作、数据空间、数据公地等场景中的应用。

Result: 战略数据管理能够将治理原则转化为实践，建立数据生态系统信任，确保数据不仅被治理，更能有意义地服务社会。在AI时代尤为重要，促进负责任的数据重用和公共价值创造。

Conclusion: 战略数据管理是应对当前数据获取挑战的关键制度创新，它超越了传统内向型管理，专注于激活数据公共价值，是AI时代确保数据服务于社会的必要功能。

Abstract: As societal challenges grow more complex, access to data for public interest use is paradoxically becoming more constrained. This emerging data winter is not simply a matter of scarcity, but of shrinking legitimate and trusted pathways for responsible data reuse. Concerns over misuse, regulatory uncertainty, and the competitive race to train AI systems have concentrated data access among a few actors while raising costs and inhibiting collaboration. Prevailing data governance models, focused on compliance, risk management, and internal control, are necessary but insufficient. They often result in data that is technically available yet practically inaccessible, legally shareable yet institutionally unusable, or socially illegitimate to deploy. This paper proposes strategic data stewardship as a complementary institutional function designed to systematically, sustainably, and responsibly activate data for public value. Unlike traditional stewardship, which tends to be inwardlooking, strategic data stewardship focuses on enabling cross sector reuse, reducing missed opportunities, and building durable, ecosystem-level collaboration. It outlines core principles, functions, and competencies, and introduces a practical Data Stewardship Canvas to support adoption across contexts such as data collaboratives, data spaces, and data commons. Strategic data stewardship, the paper argues, is essential in the age of AI: it translates governance principles into practice, builds trust across data ecosystems, and ensures that data are not only governed, but meaningfully mobilized to serve society.

Motivation: 研究AI时代规划师角色的演变，探索如何利用大语言模型提升政策制定效率，支持跨城市政策比较和学习

Method: 1) 分析规划相关职位描述；2) 对美国气候公平计划进行语义分析，使用ChatGPT提取交通和能源相关政策、策略和行动项；3) 基于LangChain构建检索增强生成管道；4) 开发基于内容的推荐系统

Result: 1) 尽管AI关注度增加，规划职位仍保持传统领域重点（交通、环境规划、住房、土地利用）；2) 沟通职责仍是规划实践核心；3) 气候公平计划主要关注交通、环境和能源措施以减少温室气体排放，多采用肯定性语言；4) 推荐系统能有效识别政策实践相似的城市，显示政策采纳的地理相似模式

Conclusion: 展望本地化且个性化的AI辅助系统，可在城市系统中适配应用，提升政策制定效率和支持跨城市学习

Abstract: This study investigates the use of large language models to enhance the policymaking process. We first analyze planning-related job postings to revisit the evolving roles of planners in the era of AI. We then examine climate equity plans across the U.S. and apply ChatGPT to conduct semantic analysis, extracting policy, strategy, and action items related to transportation and energy. The methodological framework relied on a LangChain-native retrieval-augmented generation pipeline. Based on these extracted elements and their evaluated presence, we develop a content-based recommendation system to support cross-city policy comparison. The results indicate that, despite growing attention to AI, planning jobs largely retain their traditional domain emphases in transportation, environmental planning, housing, and land use. Communicative responsibilities remain central to planning practice. Climate equity plans commonly address transportation, environmental, and energy-related measures aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions and predominantly employ affirmative language. The demonstration of the recommendation system illustrates how planners can efficiently identify cities with similar policy practices, revealing patterns of geographic similarity in policy adoption. The study concludes by envisioning localized yet personalized AI-assisted systems that can be adapted within urban systems.

Method: 使用无监督机器学习、自然语言处理和网络分析方法，对15年间LAK会议发表的936篇完整和短文进行全面分析。

Result: 发现：1）稳定的核心高产作者群体与高流动的新进作者并存；2）资助来源与研究方向的系统性关联；3）六个持久的研究主题中心（自我调节学习、仪表板与理论、社交学习、自动反馈、多模态分析、结果预测），这些主题在全球共享但在各国重要性不同。

Conclusion: 未来面临的关键挑战：扩大参与度、减少对少数资助者的依赖、确保新兴研究方向对教育实践和社会需求保持响应。

Abstract: The learning analytics (LA) community has recently reached two important milestones: celebrating the 15th LAK conference and updating the 2011 definition of LA to reflect the 15 years of changes in the discipline. However, despite LA's growth, little is known about how research topics, funding, and collaboration, as well as the relationships among them, have developed within the community over time. This study addressed this gap by analyzing all 936 full and short papers published at LAK over a 15-year period using unsupervised machine learning, natural language processing, and network analytics. The analysis revealed a stable core of prolific authors alongside high turnover of newcomers, systematic links between funding sources and research directions, and six enduring topical centers that remain globally shared but vary in prominence across countries. These six topical centers, which encompass LA research, are: self-regulated learning, dashboards and theory, social learning, automated feedback, multimodal analytics, and outcome prediction. Our findings highlight key challenges for the future: widening participation, reducing dependency on a narrow set of funders, and ensuring that emerging research trajectories remain responsive to educational practice and societal needs.

Abstract: Urban traffic regulation policies are increasingly used to address congestion, emissions, and accessibility in cities, yet their impacts are difficult to assess due to the socio-technical complexity of urban mobility systems. Recent advances in data availability and computational power enable new forms of model-driven, simulation-based decision support for transportation policy design. This paper proposes a novel simulation paradigm for the ex-ante evaluation of both direct impacts (e.g., traffic conditions, modal shift, emissions) and indirect impacts spanning transportation-related effects, social equity, and economic accessibility. The approach integrates a multi-layer urban mobility model combining a physical layer of networks, flows, and emissions with a social layer capturing behavioral responses and adaptation to policy changes. Real-world data are used to instantiate the current "as-is" scenario, while policy alternatives and behavioral assumptions are encoded as model parameters to generate multiple "what-if" scenarios. The framework supports systematic comparison across scenarios by analyzing variations in simulated outcomes induced by policy interventions. The proposed approach is illustrated through a case study aims to assess the impacts of the introduction of broad urban traffic restriction schemes. Results demonstrate the framework's ability to explore alternative regulatory designs and user responses, supporting informed and anticipatory evaluation of urban traffic policies.
