To overcome this challenge, we\nintroduce a novel system architecture that enables fully autonomous,\nhigh-fidelity 3D scanning of static objects using UAVs weighing under 100\ngrams. Our core innovation lies in a dual-reconstruction pipeline that creates\na real-time feedback loop between data capture and flight control. A\nnear-real-time (near-RT) process uses Structure from Motion (SfM) to generate\nan instantaneous pointcloud of the object. The system analyzes the model\nquality on the fly and dynamically adapts the UAV's trajectory to intelligently\ncapture new images of poorly covered areas. This ensures comprehensive data\nacquisition. For the final, detailed output, a non-real-time (non-RT) pipeline\nemploys a Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)-based Neural 3D Reconstruction (N3DR)\napproach, fusing SfM-derived camera poses with precise Ultra Wide-Band (UWB)\nlocation data to achieve superior accuracy. We implemented and validated this\narchitecture using Crazyflie 2.1 UAVs. Our experiments, conducted in both\nsingle- and multi-UAV configurations, conclusively show that dynamic trajectory\nadaptation consistently improves reconstruction quality over static flight\npaths.

Machine learning techniques can be\nused to predict unobserved outcomes in target populations by training models on\ndata from a source population. However, differences between the source and\ntarget populations, particularly in covariate distributions, can reduce the\ntransportability of these models, potentially reducing predictive accuracy and\nintroducing bias. We propose using double machine learning for a\ncovariate-shift weighted model. First, we estimate the overlap score-namely,\nthe probability that an observation belongs to the source dataset given its\ncovariates. Second, balancing weights, defined as the density ratio of\ntarget-to-source membership probabilities, are used to reweight the individual\nobservations' contribution to the loss or likelihood function in the target\noutcome prediction model. This approach downweights source observations that\nare less similar to the target population, allowing predictions to rely more\nheavily on observations with greater overlap. As a result, predictions become\nmore generalizable under covariate shift. We illustrate this framework in the\ncontext of uncertain data on students' standardized financial literacy scores\n(FLS). Using Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART), we predict missing FLS.\nWe find minimal differences in predictive performance between the weighted and\nunweighted models, suggesting limited covariate shift in our empirical setting.\nNonetheless, the proposed approach provides a principled framework for\naddressing covariate shift and is broadly applicable to predictive modeling in\nthe social and health sciences, where differences between source and target\npopulations are common."}

We wonder about the implications for our methodological\nresearch, which aims to help decision makers cope with what econometricians\ncall identification problems, inferential problems in empirical research that\ndo not diminish as sample size grows. Of particular concern are missing data\nproblems in prediction and treatment choice. Essentially all data collection\nintended to inform decision making is subject to missing data, which gives rise\nto identification problems. Thus far, we see no indication that the current\ndominant architecture of machine learning (ML)-based artificial intelligence\n(AI) systems will outperform humans in this context. In this paper, we explain\nwhy we have reached this conclusion and why we see the missing data problem as\na cautionary case study in the quest for superintelligence more generally. We\nfirst discuss the concept of intelligence, before presenting a\ndecision-theoretic perspective that formalizes the connection between\nintelligence and identification problems. We next apply this perspective to two\nleading cases of missing data problems. Then we explain why we are skeptical\nthat AI research is currently on a path toward machines doing better than\nhumans at solving these identification problems."}

To address\nthis issue, this paper presents a new hypergraph-enabled self-supervised\ncontrastive learning (HSCL) method to accurately determine trust values between\ndevices. To implement the proposed HSCL, hypergraphs are first used to discover\nand represent high-order relationships based on social attributes. Hypergraph\naugmentation is then applied to enhance the semantics of the generated social\nhypergraph, followed by the use of a parameter-sharing hypergraph neural\nnetwork to nonlinearly fuse the high-order social relationships.

Finally, trust values between devices are\ncalculated based on device embeddings that encapsulate high-order social\nrelationships.

It allows\nLMMs to answer physical reasoning queries, such as the outcome of a potential\ncollision event from visual input. However, since parametric knowledge includes\nonly the physical laws seen during training, it is insufficient for reasoning\nwhen the inference scenario violates these physical laws. In contrast, humans\npossess the skill to adapt their physical reasoning to unseen physical\nenvironments from a few visual examples. This ability, which we refer to as\ninductive physical reasoning, is indispensable for LMMs if they are to replace\nhuman agents in safety-critical applications. Despite its importance, existing\nvisual benchmarks evaluate only the parametric knowledge in LMMs, and not\ninductive physical reasoning. To this end, we propose InPhyRe, the first visual\nquestion answering benchmark to measure inductive physical reasoning in LMMs.\nInPhyRe evaluates LMMs on their ability to predict the outcome of collision\nevents in algorithmically generated synthetic collision videos. By inspecting\n13 LMMs, InPhyRe informs us that (1) LMMs struggle to apply their limited\nparametric knowledge about universal physical laws to reasoning, (2) inductive\nphysical reasoning in LMMs is weak when demonstration samples violate universal\nphysical laws, and (3) inductive physical reasoning in LMMs suffers from\nlanguage bias and largely ignores the visual inputs, questioning the\ntrustworthiness of LMMs regarding visual inputs."}

A common way of controlling such\nmanipulators relies on adjusting tendon lengths, which is an accessible control\nparameter. This approach works well when the kinematic configuration is\nrepresentative of the real operational conditions. However, when dealing with\nmanipulators of larger size subject to gravity, it becomes necessary to solve a\nstatic force problem, using tendon force as the input and employing a mapping\nfrom the configuration space to retrieve tendon length. Alternatively,\nmeasurements of the manipulator posture can be used to iteratively adjust\ntendon lengths to achieve a desired posture. Hence, either tension measurement\nor state estimation of the manipulator are required, both of which are not\nalways accurately available. Here, we propose a solution by reconciling cables\ntension and length as the input for the solution of the system forward statics.\nWe develop a screw-based formulation for a tendon-driven, multi-segment,\nhyper-redundant manipulator with elastic joints and introduce a forward statics\niterative solution method that equivalently makes use of either tendon length\nor tension as the input. This strategy is experimentally validated using a\ntraditional tension input first, subsequently showing the efficacy of the\nmethod when exclusively tendon lengths are used. The results confirm the\npossibility to perform open-loop control in static conditions using a kinematic\ninput only, thus bypassing some of the practical problems with tension\nmeasurement and state estimation of hyper-redundant systems."}

In contrast, humans\npossess the skill to adapt their physical reasoning to unseen physical\nenvironments from a few visual examples. This ability, which we refer to as\ninductive physical reasoning, is indispensable for LMMs if they are to replace\nhuman agents in safety-critical applications. Despite its importance, existing\nvisual benchmarks evaluate only the parametric knowledge in LMMs, and not\ninductive physical reasoning.

Our multi-objective optimization approach adaptively\ntunes objective weights to maximize points of interest (POI) quality and task\ncompletion rate while minimizing route distance, subject to three key\nconstraints: user time limits, POI opening hours, and task dependencies. We\nconduct extensive experiments using 1,000 routing prompts sampled with varying\ncomplexity across 14 countries and 27 cities worldwide. The results demonstrate\nthat our approach achieves superior performance with guarantees across multiple\nconstraints."}

The\nconventional PPF problem considers a fixed topology, and the solutions to such\na PPF problem are associated with this topology.

The typical approach, where a policy and\nvision encoder are trained jointly from scratch, generalizes poorly to novel\nvisual scene changes. Using pre-trained vision models (PVMs) to inform a policy\nnetwork improves robustness in model-free reinforcement learning (MFRL). Recent\ndevelopments in Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) suggest that MBRL is\nmore sample-efficient than MFRL. However, counterintuitively, existing work has\nfound PVMs to be ineffective in MBRL. Here, we investigate PVM's effectiveness\nin MBRL, specifically on generalization under visual domain shifts. We show\nthat, in scenarios with severe shifts, PVMs perform much better than a baseline\nmodel trained from scratch. We further investigate the effects of varying\nlevels of fine-tuning of PVMs. Our results show that partial fine-tuning can\nmaintain the highest average task performance under the most extreme\ndistribution shifts. Our results demonstrate that PVMs are highly successful in\npromoting robustness in visual policy learning, providing compelling evidence\nfor their wider adoption in model-based robotic learning applications."}

However,\nprior VLN RL methods lack dynamic interaction with the environment and depend\non expert trajectories for reward shaping, rather than engaging in open-ended\nactive exploration. This restricts the agent's ability to discover diverse and\nplausible navigation routes. To address these limitations, we propose\nActiveVLN, a VLN framework that explicitly enables active exploration through\nmulti-turn RL. In the first stage, a small fraction of expert trajectories is\nused for IL to bootstrap the agent. In the second stage, the agent iteratively\npredicts and executes actions, automatically collects diverse trajectories, and\noptimizes multiple rollouts via the GRPO objective. To further improve RL\nefficiency, we introduce a dynamic early-stopping strategy to prune long-tail\nor likely failed trajectories, along with additional engineering optimizations.\nExperiments show that ActiveVLN achieves the largest performance gains over IL\nbaselines compared to both DAgger-based and prior RL-based post-training\nmethods, while reaching competitive performance with state-of-the-art\napproaches despite using a smaller model. Code and data will be released soon."}

First, we implement a\nstructured threshold based control rule, where capacity is increased\nproportionally when the stochastic capacity factor falls below a fixed level.\nThis formulation leads to a nonlinear partial integro-differential equation\n(PIDE), which we solve by reformulating it as a backward stochastic\ndifferential equation with jumps. We extend the DBDP solver in\n\\cite{hure2020deep} to the pure jump setting, employing a dual neural network\narchitecture to approximate both the value function and the jump sensitivity.\n  Second, we propose a fully data driven deep control algorithm that directly\nlearns the optimal feedback policy by minimizing the expected cost functional\nusing neural networks.

A key\nbottleneck in traversability estimation lies in efficiently achieving reliable\nand robust predictions while accurately encoding both geometric and semantic\ninformation across diverse environments. We introduce Navigation via Mixture of\nExperts (NAVMOE), a hierarchical and modular approach for traversability\nestimation and local navigation. NAVMOE combines multiple specialized models\nfor specific terrain types, each of which can be either a classical model-based\nor a learning-based approach that predicts traversability for specific terrain\ntypes. NAVMOE dynamically weights the contributions of different models based\non the input environment through a gating network. Overall, our approach offers\nthree advantages: First, NAVMOE enables traversability estimation to adaptively\nleverage specialized approaches for different terrains, which enhances\ngeneralization across diverse and unseen environments. Second, our approach\nsignificantly improves efficiency with negligible cost of solution quality by\nintroducing a training-free lazy gating mechanism, which is designed to\nminimize the number of activated experts during inference. Third, our approach\nuses a two-stage training strategy that enables the training for the gating\nnetworks within the hybrid MoE method that contains nondifferentiable modules.\nExtensive experiments show that NAVMOE delivers a better efficiency and\nperformance balance than any individual expert or full ensemble across\ndifferent domains, improving cross- domain generalization and reducing average\ncomputational cost by 81.2% via lazy gating, with less than a 2% loss in path\nquality."}

A common way of controlling such\nmanipulators relies on adjusting tendon lengths, which is an accessible control\nparameter. This approach works well when the kinematic configuration is\nrepresentative of the real operational conditions. However, when dealing with\nmanipulators of larger size subject to gravity, it becomes necessary to solve a\nstatic force problem, using tendon force as the input and employing a mapping\nfrom the configuration space to retrieve tendon length. Alternatively,\nmeasurements of the manipulator posture can be used to iteratively adjust\ntendon lengths to achieve a desired posture.

These estimated variables enable grasp posture\nreconstruction, safe handling of deformable objects, and blind grasping with\nproprioceptive-only recognition of objects with varying geometry and stiffness.\nFinger-level experiments and hand-level demonstrations confirmed the\neffectiveness of the proposed approach.

To address this gap, we\nintroduce a novel benchmark of 369 instances of the College Admission Problem,\na canonical example of a matching problem with preferences, to evaluate LLMs\nacross key dimensions: feasibility, stability, and optimality. We employ this\nbenchmark to assess the performance of several open-weight LLMs. Our results\nfirst reveal that while LLMs can satisfy certain constraints, they struggle to\nmeet all evaluation criteria consistently. They also show that reasoning LLMs,\nlike QwQ and GPT-oss, significantly outperform traditional models such as\nLlama, Qwen or Mistral, defined here as models used without any dedicated\nreasoning mechanisms.

Additionally, by leveraging commonsense knowledge\nfrom Large Language Models (LLM), objects are pre-classified as either shared\nor owned, and only owned objects are targeted for questioning.

Moreover, we observed that LLMs reacted differently to\nthe various prompting strategies tested, which include Chain-of-Thought,\nIn-Context Learning and role-based prompting, with no prompt consistently\noffering the best performance. Finally, we report the performances from\niterative prompting with auto-generated feedback and show that they are not\nmonotonic; they can peak early and then significantly decline in later\nattempts. Overall, this work offers a new perspective on model reasoning\nperformance and the effectiveness of prompting strategies in combinatorial\noptimization problems with preferential constraints."}

This work presents a novel\nframework that integrates multi-channel bird's-eye-view occupancy grids with\ntransformer-based sequence modeling for tactical driving in complex roundabout\nscenarios. To address the imbalance between frequent low-risk states and rare\nsafety-critical decisions, we propose the Uncertainty-Weighted Decision\nTransformer (UWDT). UWDT employs a frozen teacher transformer to estimate\nper-token predictive entropy, which is then used as a weight in the student\nmodel's loss function. This mechanism amplifies learning from uncertain,\nhigh-impact states while maintaining stability across common low-risk\ntransitions. Experiments in a roundabout simulator, across varying traffic\ndensities, show that UWDT consistently outperforms other baselines in terms of\nreward, collision rate, and behavioral stability.
