In this paper, we introduce a novel regularized ensemble method that extends the traditional linear opinion pool by leveraging both current forecasts and historical performances to set the weights. Unlike existing approaches that rely only on either the current forecasts or past accuracy, our method accounts for both sources simultaneously. It learns weights by minimizing the variance of the combined forecast (or its transformed version) while incorporating a regularization term informed by historical performances. We also show that this approach has a Bayesian interpretation. Different distributional assumptions within this Bayesian framework yield different functional forms for the variance component and the regularization term, adapting the method to various scenarios. In empirical studies on Walmart sales and macroeconomic forecasting, our ensemble outperforms leading benchmark models both when experts' full forecasting histories are available and when experts enter and exit over time, resulting in incomplete historical records. Throughout, we provide illustrative examples that show how the optimal weights are determined and, based on the empirical results, we discuss where the framework's strengths lie and when experts' past versus current forecasts are more informative.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u540c\u65f6\u5229\u7528\u5f53\u524d\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u5386\u53f2\u8868\u73b0\u6765\u8bbe\u7f6e\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5355\u4e00\u4fe1\u606f\u6765\u6e90\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5", "motivation": "\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u4e2a\u4e13\u5bb6\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u901a\u5e38\u6bd4\u4f9d\u8d56\u5355\u4e00\u4e13\u5bb6\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u53ea\u4f9d\u8d56\u5f53\u524d\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u53ea\u4f9d\u8d56\u5386\u53f2\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u540c\u65f6\u5229\u7528\u4e24\u79cd\u4fe1\u606f\u6e90\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u7ec4\u5408\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\uff08\u6216\u5176\u53d8\u6362\u7248\u672c\uff09\u6765\u5b66\u4e60\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u52a0\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u5386\u53f2\u8868\u73b0\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u9879\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5047\u8bbe\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\u5206\u91cf\u548c\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u9879\u5f62\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6c83\u5c14\u739b\u9500\u552e\u548c\u5b8f\u89c2\u7ecf\u6d4e\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u9886\u5148\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u4e13\u5bb6\u662f\u5426\u6709\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u5386\u53f2\u8bb0\u5f55\uff0c\u8fd8\u662f\u5728\u4e13\u5bb6\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u8fdb\u51fa\u5bfc\u81f4\u5386\u53f2\u8bb0\u5f55\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u90fd\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u540c\u65f6\u5229\u7528\u5f53\u524d\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u5386\u53f2\u8868\u73b0\u6765\u786e\u5b9a\u6700\u4f18\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u90fd\u80fd\u9002\u5e94\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u8fd8\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u6240\u5728\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4f55\u65f6\u5386\u53f2\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5f53\u524d\u9884\u6d4b\u66f4\u5177\u4fe1\u606f\u6027\u3002"}}

However, according to the questionnaire conducted in this study, 82.5% of users of online English learning platforms that feature a check-in service have failed to maintain the daily check-in behavior for long-term language learning, mainly by reason of demotivation, forgetfulness, boredom, and insufficient time. As a language learner, I have an empirical experience in maintaining a record of over 4,000 daily check-ins on China's leading online English learning platform of Shanbay. In the meantime, I have been constantly exploring a practical solution to help cultivate perseverance for other users to follow through the learning routine.

While cross-fitting is commonly employed, it can be statistically inefficient and computationally burdensome when first-stage learners are complex and the effective sample size is governed by the number of independent clusters. We show that valid inference can be achieved without sample splitting by combining Neyman-orthogonal moment conditions with a localisation-based empirical process approach, allowing for an arbitrary number of clustering dimensions. The resulting DML-GMM estimators are shown to be asymptotically linear and asymptotically normal under multiway clustered dependence.

Developing dedicated car-following models for AS is critical to understanding their traffic impacts; however, few studies have calibrated such models with field data. More advanced machine learning (ML) techniques have not yet been applied to AS trajectories, leaving the potential of ML for capturing AS dynamics unexplored and constraining the development of dedicated AS models. Furthermore, there is a lack of a unified framework for systematically evaluating and comparing the performance of car-following models to replicate real trajectories. Existing car-following studies often rely on disparate metrics, which limit reproducibility and performance comparability.\n  This study addresses these gaps through two main contributions: (1) the calibration of a diverse set of car-following models using real-world AS trajectory data, including eight machine learning algorithms and two physics-based models; and (2) the introduction of a multi-criteria evaluation framework that integrates measures of prediction accuracy, trajectory stability, and statistical similarity, which provides a generalizable methodology for a systematic assessment of car-following models.\n  Results indicated that the proposed calibrated XGBoost model achieved the best overall performance.

Explainable AI (XAI) addresses this by clarifying how models generate predictions, yet most methods demand technical expertise, limiting their value for novices. This gap is especially critical in no-code ML platforms, which seek to democratize AI but rarely include explainability. We present a human-centered XAI module in DashAI, an open-source no-code ML platform. The module integrates three complementary techniques, which are Partial Dependence Plots (PDP), Permutation Feature Importance (PFI), and KernelSHAP, into DashAI's workflow for tabular classification. A user study (N = 20; ML novices and experts) evaluated usability and the impact of explanations. Results show: (i) high task success ($\\geq80\\%$) across all explainability tasks; (ii) novices rated explanations as useful, accurate, and trustworthy on the Explanation Satisfaction Scale (ESS, Cronbach's $\u03b1$ = 0.74, a measure of internal consistency), while experts were more critical of sufficiency and completeness; and (iii) explanations improved perceived predictability and confidence on the Trust in Automation scale (TiA, $\u03b1$ = 0.60), with novices showing higher trust than experts. These findings highlight a central challenge for XAI in no-code ML, making explanations both accessible to novices and sufficiently detailed for experts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728DashAI\u65e0\u4ee3\u7801ML\u5e73\u53f0\u4e2d\u96c6\u6210PDP\u3001PFI\u548cKernelSHAP\u4e09\u79cd\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u89e3\u91ca\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u65b0\u624b\u4fe1\u4efb\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u5e73\u8861\u65b0\u624b\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u6027\u548c\u4e13\u5bb6\u8be6\u7ec6\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "motivation": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u654f\u611f\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u5bf9\u51b3\u7b56\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709XAI\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u6280\u672f\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5728\u65e0\u4ee3\u7801ML\u5e73\u53f0\u4e2d\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5e73\u53f0\u65e8\u5728\u6c11\u4e3b\u5316AI\u5374\u5f88\u5c11\u5305\u542b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u529f\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u5f00\u6e90\u65e0\u4ee3\u7801ML\u5e73\u53f0DashAI\u4e2d\u5f00\u53d1\u4eba\u672c\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684XAI\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u4e09\u79cd\u4e92\u8865\u6280\u672f\uff1a\u90e8\u5206\u4f9d\u8d56\u56fe(PDP)\u3001\u6392\u5217\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u8981\u6027(PFI)\u548cKernelSHAP\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8868\u683c\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76(N=20\uff0c\u5305\u62ecML\u65b0\u624b\u548c\u4e13\u5bb6)\u8bc4\u4f30\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "1) \u6240\u6709\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u226580%\uff1b2) \u65b0\u624b\u5728\u89e3\u91ca\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6\u91cf\u8868(ESS)\u4e0a\u8ba4\u4e3a\u89e3\u91ca\u6709\u7528\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u53ef\u4fe1\uff0c\u800c\u4e13\u5bb6\u5bf9\u5145\u5206\u6027\u548c\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u66f4\u6311\u5254\uff1b3) \u89e3\u91ca\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4fe1\u4efb\u91cf\u8868(TiA)\u4e2d\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u548c\u4fe1\u5fc3\uff0c\u65b0\u624b\u6bd4\u4e13\u5bb6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u4fe1\u4efb\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65e0\u4ee3\u7801ML\u4e2d\u7684XAI\u9762\u4e34\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u9700\u8981\u4f7f\u89e3\u91ca\u65e2\u80fd\u8ba9\u65b0\u624b\u8bbf\u95ee\uff0c\u53c8\u80fd\u4e3a\u4e13\u5bb6\u63d0\u4f9b\u8db3\u591f\u8be6\u7ec6\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u6c11\u4e3b\u5316AI\u5e73\u53f0\u4e2d\u96c6\u6210\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

In this manuscript, we present an Enhanced Forest Inventory (EFI) and demonstrate its utility for high-resolution wildlife habitat mapping. The project area covers 270,000 acres of the Eldorado National Forest in California's Sierra Nevada. By integrating 118 ground-truth Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) plots with multi-modal remote sensing data (LiDAR, aerial photography, and Sentinel-2 satellite imagery), we developed predictive models for key forest attributes. Our methodology employed a two-tier segmentation approach, partitioning the landscape into approximately 575,000 reporting units with an average size of 0.5 acre to capture forest heterogeneity. We utilized an Elastic-Net Regression framework and automated feature selection to relate remote sensing metrics to ground-measured variables such as basal area, stems per acre, and canopy cover. These physical metrics were translated into functional habitat attributes to evaluate suitability for two focal species: the California Spotted Owl (Strix occidentalis occidentalis) and the Pacific Fisher (Pekania pennanti). Our analysis identified 25,630 acres of nesting and 26,622 acres of foraging habitat for the owl, and 25,636 acres of likely habitat for the fisher based on structural requirements like large-diameter trees and high canopy closure. The results demonstrate that EFIs provide a critical bridge between forestry and conservation ecology, offering forest managers a spatially explicit tool to monitor ecosystem health and manage vulnerable species in complex environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u589e\u5f3a\u578b\u68ee\u6797\u6e05\u67e5(EFI)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u591a\u6e90\u9065\u611f\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u5730\u9762\u8c03\u67e5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u91ce\u751f\u52a8\u7269\u6816\u606f\u5730\u5236\u56fe\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u52a0\u5ddeSierra Nevada\u5730\u533a\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u68ee\u6797\u6e05\u67e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u6728\u6750\u91c7\u4f10\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u7ec6\u8282\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u73b0\u4ee3\u591a\u8d44\u6e90\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u91ce\u751f\u52a8\u7269\u6816\u606f\u5730\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u6574\u5408118\u4e2a\u5730\u9762FIA\u6837\u5730\u4e0e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u9065\u611f\u6570\u636e(LiDAR\u3001\u822a\u7a7a\u6444\u5f71\u3001Sentinel-2)\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u5c42\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u666f\u89c2\u5212\u5206\u4e3a\u7ea657.5\u4e07\u4e2a\u62a5\u544a\u5355\u5143\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u5f39\u6027\u7f51\u7edc\u56de\u5f52\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u5efa\u7acb\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u52a0\u5dde\u6591\u70b9\u732b\u5934\u9e70\u768425,630\u82f1\u4ea9\u7b51\u5de2\u6816\u606f\u5730\u548c26,622\u82f1\u4ea9\u89c5\u98df\u6816\u606f\u5730\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u592a\u5e73\u6d0b\u6e14\u8c82\u768425,636\u82f1\u4ea9\u6f5c\u5728\u6816\u606f\u5730\uff1b\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u6797\u5206\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "conclusion": "\u589e\u5f3a\u578b\u68ee\u6797\u6e05\u67e5\u4e3a\u6797\u4e1a\u4e0e\u4fdd\u62a4\u751f\u6001\u5b66\u4e4b\u95f4\u642d\u5efa\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u6865\u6881\uff0c\u4e3a\u68ee\u6797\u7ba1\u7406\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7a7a\u95f4\u660e\u786e\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u76d1\u6d4b\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u5065\u5eb7\u548c\u7ba1\u7406\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u7269\u79cd\u3002"}}

Unsurprisingly, GenAI tools proliferate kitsch in the hands of amateurs and hobbyists, but various shortcomings also induce kitsch into a more ambitious, professional artists' production with GenAI. I explore them in this paper. Following the introductory outline of digital kitsch and AI art, I review GenAI artworks that manifest five interrelated types of kitsch-engendering expressive flaws: the superficial foregrounding or faulty circumvention of generative models' formal signatures, the feeble critique of AI, the mimetics, and the unacknowledged poetic similarities, all marked by an overreliance on AI as a cultural signifier. I discuss the normalization of these blunders through GenAI art's good standing within the art world and keen relationship with the AI industry, which contributes to the adulteration of AI discourse and the possible corruption of artistic literacy. In conclusion, I emphasize that recognizing different facets of artists' uncritical embrace of techno-cultural trends, comprehending their functions, and anticipating their unintended effects is crucial for reaching relevance and responsibility in AI art.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u827a\u672f\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u5a9a\u4fd7\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e13\u4e1a\u827a\u672f\u5bb6\u4f7f\u7528AI\u65f6\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u4e94\u79cd\u8868\u8fbe\u7f3a\u9677\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u827a\u672f\u7d20\u517b\u548cAI\u8bdd\u8bed\u7684\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5728\u4e3b\u6d41\u6587\u5316\u4e2d\u5f15\u8d77\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5173\u6ce8\uff0c\u50ac\u751f\u4e86\u7ecf\u6d4e\u3001\u6cd5\u5f8b\u548c\u7f8e\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u867d\u7136\u4e1a\u4f59\u7231\u597d\u8005\u4f7f\u7528AI\u5de5\u5177\u5e38\u4ea7\u751f\u5a9a\u4fd7\u4f5c\u54c1\uff0c\u4f46\u4e13\u4e1a\u827a\u672f\u5bb6\u5728\u4f7f\u7528AI\u65f6\u4e5f\u5b58\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u7f3a\u9677\u5bfc\u81f4\u5a9a\u4fd7\u5316\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u8ba8\u8fd9\u4e9b\u73b0\u8c61\u53ca\u5176\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u4ecb\u7ecd\u6570\u5b57\u5a9a\u4fd7\u548cAI\u827a\u672f\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u56de\u987e\u5206\u6790\u5c55\u793a\u4e94\u79cd\u76f8\u4e92\u5173\u8054\u7684\u5a9a\u4fd7\u5316\u8868\u8fbe\u7f3a\u9677\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u827a\u672f\u4f5c\u54c1\uff1a1\uff09\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5f62\u5f0f\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u80a4\u6d45\u7a81\u51fa\u6216\u9519\u8bef\u89c4\u907f\uff1b2\uff09\u5bf9AI\u7684\u65e0\u529b\u6279\u5224\uff1b3\uff09\u6a21\u4eff\u6027\uff1b4\uff09\u672a\u627f\u8ba4\u7684\u8bd7\u610f\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff1b5\uff09\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56AI\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6587\u5316\u7b26\u53f7\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7f3a\u9677\u901a\u8fc7AI\u827a\u672f\u5728\u827a\u672f\u754c\u7684\u826f\u597d\u5730\u4f4d\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0eAI\u4ea7\u4e1a\u7684\u5bc6\u5207\u5173\u7cfb\u800c\u88ab\u6b63\u5e38\u5316\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4AI\u8bdd\u8bed\u7684\u6c61\u67d3\u548c\u827a\u672f\u7d20\u517b\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u8150\u5316\u3002\u827a\u672f\u754c\u5bf9AI\u827a\u672f\u7684\u8ba4\u53ef\u53cd\u800c\u52a9\u957f\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7f3a\u9677\u7684\u4f20\u64ad\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8ba4\u8bc6\u5230\u827a\u672f\u5bb6\u5bf9\u6280\u672f\u6587\u5316\u8d8b\u52bf\u4e0d\u52a0\u6279\u5224\u7684\u62e5\u62b1\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u9884\u89c1\u5176\u610f\u5916\u540e\u679c\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5b9e\u73b0AI\u827a\u672f\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u548c\u8d23\u4efb\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u8fd9\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7ef4\u62a4\u827a\u672f\u8d28\u91cf\u548cAI\u8bdd\u8bed\u7684\u5065\u5eb7\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

This raises a basic question: what policy object are exposure-based estimands implicitly targeting, and how should we interpret their direct and spillover components relative to the underlying policy question? We take as primitive the marginal policy effect, defined as the effect of a small change in the treatment probability under the actual experimental design, and show that any researcher-chosen exposure mapping induces a unique pseudo-true outcome model. This model is the best approximation to the underlying potential outcomes that depends only on the user-chosen exposure. Utilizing that representation, the marginal policy effect admits a canonical decomposition into exposure-based direct and spillover effects, and each component provides its optimal approximation to the corresponding oracle objects that would be available if interference were fully known. We then focus on a setting that nests important empirical and theoretical applications in which both local network spillovers and global spillovers, such as market equilibrium, operate. There, the marginal policy effect further decomposes asymptotically into direct, local, and global channels. An important implication is that many existing methods are more robust than previously understood once we reinterpret their targets as channel-specific components of this pseudo-true policy estimand. Simulations and a semi-synthetic experiment calibrated to a large cash-transfer experiment show that these components can be recovered in realistic experimental designs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u5e72\u6270\u6548\u5e94\u5b58\u5728\u65f6\u89e3\u91ca\u66b4\u9732\u6620\u5c04\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cf\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u8fb9\u9645\u653f\u7b56\u6548\u5e94\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u76f4\u63a5\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u6ea2\u51fa\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4\u4e4b\u524d\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5e94\u7528\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u5e38\u4f7f\u7528\u4f4e\u7ef4\u66b4\u9732\u6620\u5c04\u6765\u5efa\u6a21\u4ed6\u4eba\u5904\u7406\u7684\u5e72\u6270\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u8fd9\u79cd\u6620\u5c04\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u9519\u8bef\u8bbe\u5b9a\u3002\u8fd9\u5f15\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u672c\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u66b4\u9732\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cf\u9690\u542b\u5730\u9488\u5bf9\u4ec0\u4e48\u653f\u7b56\u5bf9\u8c61\uff1f\u5982\u4f55\u89e3\u91ca\u5176\u76f4\u63a5\u548c\u6ea2\u51fa\u6548\u5e94\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u57fa\u7840\u653f\u7b56\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u610f\u4e49\uff1f", "method": "\u5c06\u8fb9\u9645\u653f\u7b56\u6548\u5e94\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0b\u5904\u7406\u6982\u7387\u5fae\u5c0f\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4efb\u4f55\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u66b4\u9732\u6620\u5c04\u90fd\u4f1a\u8bf1\u5bfc\u4e00\u4e2a\u552f\u4e00\u7684\u4f2a\u771f\u5b9e\u7ed3\u679c\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u57fa\u4e8e\u7528\u6237\u9009\u62e9\u66b4\u9732\u5bf9\u6f5c\u5728\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u8fd1\u4f3c\u3002\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u79cd\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u8fb9\u9645\u653f\u7b56\u6548\u5e94\u53ef\u4ee5\u89c4\u8303\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u66b4\u9732\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u6ea2\u51fa\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u540c\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u90e8\u7f51\u7edc\u6ea2\u51fa\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u6ea2\u51fa\uff08\u5982\u5e02\u573a\u5747\u8861\uff09\u7684\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fb9\u9645\u653f\u7b56\u6548\u5e94\u53ef\u4ee5\u6e10\u8fd1\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u76f4\u63a5\u3001\u5c40\u90e8\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u6e20\u9053\u3002\u8bb8\u591a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e00\u65e6\u91cd\u65b0\u89e3\u91ca\u5176\u76ee\u6807\u4e3a\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4f2a\u771f\u5b9e\u653f\u7b56\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cf\u7684\u6e20\u9053\u7279\u5b9a\u6210\u5206\uff0c\u5c31\u6bd4\u4e4b\u524d\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u73b0\u91d1\u8f6c\u79fb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7684\u534a\u5408\u6210\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6210\u5206\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u89e3\u91ca\u5e72\u6270\u6548\u5e94\u5b58\u5728\u65f6\u7684\u66b4\u9732\u6620\u5c04\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

We introduce Latent Generative Solvers (LGS), a two-stage framework that (i) maps diverse PDE states into a shared latent physics space with a pretrained VAE, and (ii) learns probabilistic latent dynamics with a Transformer trained by flow matching. Our key mechanism is an uncertainty knob that perturbs latent inputs during training and inference, teaching the solver to correct off-manifold rollout drift and stabilizing autoregressive prediction. We further use flow forcing to update a system descriptor (context) from model-generated trajectories, aligning train/test conditioning and improving long-term stability. We pretrain on a curated corpus of $\\sim$2.5M trajectories at $128^2$ resolution spanning 12 PDE families. LGS matches strong deterministic neural-operator baselines on short horizons while substantially reducing rollout drift on long horizons.

We model religious traditions as distinct generative mappings from a shared, low-dimensional latent space to the high-dimensional space of observable cultural forms, and define three competing generative configurations corresponding to exclusivism, universalism, and perennialism, alongside syncretism as direct mixing in observable space. Through abductive comparison, we argue that exclusivism cannot parsimoniously account for cross-traditional contemplative convergence, that syncretism fails because combining the outputs of distinct generative processes produces incoherent artifacts, and that universalism suffers from posterior collapse: stripping traditions to a common core discards the structural information necessary for inference. The perennialist configuration provides the best explanatory fit. Within this framework, strict orthodoxy emerges not as a cultural constraint but as a structural necessity: the contemplative practices that recover the latent source must be matched to the specific tradition whose forms they take as input. The unity of religions, if it exists, is real but inaccessible by shortcut: one must go deep rather than wide.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u4f7f\u7528\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6570\u5b66\u6846\u67b6\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5b97\u6559\u8ba4\u8bc6\u8bba\uff0c\u5c06\u5b97\u6559\u4f20\u7edf\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u4ece\u5171\u4eab\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5230\u53ef\u89c2\u5bdf\u6587\u5316\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u751f\u6210\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u8bba\u8bc1\u4e86\u6c38\u6052\u4e3b\u4e49\u914d\u7f6e\u6700\u80fd\u89e3\u91ca\u8de8\u4f20\u7edf\u51a5\u601d\u5b9e\u8df5\u7684\u6536\u655b\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5b97\u6559\u8ba4\u8bc6\u8bba\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u5b97\u6559\u4f20\u7edf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u5b66\u5efa\u6a21\u6765\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u6392\u4ed6\u4e3b\u4e49\u3001\u666e\u904d\u4e3b\u4e49\u3001\u6c38\u6052\u4e3b\u4e49\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u4e3b\u4e49\u7b49\u4e0d\u540c\u5b97\u6559\u8ba4\u8bc6\u8bba\u7acb\u573a\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5b97\u6559\u4f20\u7edf\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u4ece\u5171\u4eab\u4f4e\u7ef4\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5230\u9ad8\u7ef4\u53ef\u89c2\u5bdf\u6587\u5316\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u751f\u6210\u6620\u5c04\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6eaf\u56e0\u6bd4\u8f83\u5206\u6790\u56db\u79cd\u914d\u7f6e\uff1a\u6392\u4ed6\u4e3b\u4e49\u3001\u666e\u904d\u4e3b\u4e49\u3001\u6c38\u6052\u4e3b\u4e49\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u4e3b\u4e49\u3002", "result": "\u6392\u4ed6\u4e3b\u4e49\u65e0\u6cd5\u7b80\u6d01\u89e3\u91ca\u8de8\u4f20\u7edf\u51a5\u601d\u6536\u655b\uff1b\u6df7\u5408\u4e3b\u4e49\u56e0\u7ec4\u5408\u4e0d\u540c\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8f93\u51fa\u800c\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u8fde\u8d2f\u4ea7\u7269\uff1b\u666e\u904d\u4e3b\u4e49\u906d\u53d7\u540e\u9a8c\u574d\u584c\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u6c38\u6052\u4e3b\u4e49\u914d\u7f6e\u63d0\u4f9b\u6700\u4f73\u89e3\u91ca\u62df\u5408\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6c38\u6052\u4e3b\u4e49\u6846\u67b6\u6700\u80fd\u89e3\u91ca\u5b97\u6559\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u4e25\u683c\u6b63\u7edf\u6027\u6210\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u800c\u975e\u6587\u5316\u7ea6\u675f\u3002\u5b97\u6559\u7edf\u4e00\u6027\u771f\u5b9e\u5b58\u5728\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u6377\u5f84\u83b7\u5f97\uff0c\u5fc5\u987b\u6df1\u5165\u800c\u975e\u5e7f\u6cdb\u63a2\u7d22\u3002"}}

Problems can arise when both outcomes and errors are serially correlated, when there are few clusters or few treated clusters, when cluster sizes vary greatly, and in various other cases. In recent years, recognition of the ``staggered adoption'' problem has shifted the focus away from inference towards consistent estimation of treatment effects. One of the most popular new estimators is the CSDID procedure of Callaway and Sant'Anna (2021). We find that the issues of over-rejection with few clusters and/or few treated clusters are at least as severe for CSDID as for traditional DiD methods. We also propose using a cluster jackknife for inference with CSDID, which simulations suggest greatly improves inference.

The contribution partitions representation space into persistence regions and boundaries, and treats decision reuse as a mechanically checkable condition.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faDecisionDB\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51b3\u7b56\u503c\u6620\u5c04\u8bb0\u5f55\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u8868\u793a\u5bf9\u8ba1\u7b97\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cd\u653e\u548c\u5ba1\u8ba1", "motivation": "\u76f8\u540c\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u8868\u793a\u5f62\u5f0f\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f15\u64ce\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u8bb0\u5f55\u54ea\u4e9b\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u7ed3\u679c\u3001\u54ea\u4e9b\u4f1a\u6539\u53d8\u7ed3\u679c", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u51b3\u7b56\u503c\u6620\u5c04\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1DecisionDB\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\uff0c\u8bb0\u5f55\u8868\u793a\u4e0e\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5185\u5bb9\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u6807\u8bc6\u7b26\u548c\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u5199\u5165\u5b58\u50a8\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cd\u653e", "result": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u5c06\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u5212\u5206\u4e3a\u4fdd\u6301\u533a\u57df\u548c\u8fb9\u754c\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5c06\u51b3\u7b56\u91cd\u7528\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u673a\u68b0\u53ef\u68c0\u67e5\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e09\u4e2a\u6807\u8bc6\u5b57\u6bb5\u4e0e\u6301\u4e45\u5316\u503c\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u5339\u914d", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u8868\u793a\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u91cd\u653e\u548c\u5ba1\u8ba1\uff0c\u5bf9\u8ba1\u7b97\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49"}}

Long before direct system exposure, user expectations are mediated through high-stakes public discourse on social platforms. However, platform-mediated engagement signals (e.g., upvotes) may inadvertently function as a ``credibility proxy,'' potentially stifling critical evaluation.\n  This paper investigates the interplay between social proof and verification timing in online discussions of agentic AI. Analyzing a longitudinal dataset from two distinct Reddit communities with contrasting interaction cultures-r/OpenClaw and r/Moltbook-we operationalize verification cues via reproducible lexical rules and model the ``time-to-first-verification'' using a right-censored survival analysis framework.\n  Our findings reveal a systemic ``Popularity Paradox'': high-visibility discussions in both subreddits experience significantly delayed or entirely absent verification cues compared to low-visibility threads. This temporal lag creates a critical window for ``Narrative Lock-in,'' where early, unverified claims crystallize into collective cognitive biases before evidence-seeking behaviors emerge. We discuss the implications of this ``credibility-by-visibility'' effect for AI safety and propose ``epistemic friction'' as a design intervention to rebalance engagement-driven platforms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u4e0a\u5173\u4e8e\u81ea\u4e3bAI\u7684\u8ba8\u8bba\u5b58\u5728\"\u6d41\u884c\u5ea6\u6096\u8bba\"\uff1a\u9ad8\u53ef\u89c1\u5ea6\u8ba8\u8bba\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u663e\u8457\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u65e9\u671f\u672a\u7ecf\u8bc1\u5b9e\u7684\u8bf4\u6cd5\u5728\u8bc1\u636e\u51fa\u73b0\u524d\u56fa\u5316\u4e3a\u96c6\u4f53\u8ba4\u77e5\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u4e3bAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u6b63\u5728\u91cd\u5851\u4eba\u673a\u4fe1\u4efb\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7528\u6237\u76f4\u63a5\u63a5\u89e6\u7cfb\u7edf\u524d\uff0c\u5176\u671f\u671b\u5df2\u901a\u8fc7\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u4e0a\u7684\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u516c\u5171\u8ba8\u8bba\u5f62\u6210\u3002\u5e73\u53f0\u53c2\u4e0e\u4fe1\u53f7\uff08\u5982\u70b9\u8d5e\uff09\u53ef\u80fd\u65e0\u610f\u4e2d\u6210\u4e3a\"\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4ee3\u7406\"\uff0c\u6291\u5236\u6279\u5224\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u4e24\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u4e92\u52a8\u6587\u5316\u7684Reddit\u793e\u533a\uff08r/OpenClaw\u548cr/Moltbook\uff09\u7684\u7eb5\u5411\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u7684\u8bcd\u6c47\u89c4\u5219\u64cd\u4f5c\u5316\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u53f3\u5220\u5931\u751f\u5b58\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\u5efa\u6a21\"\u9996\u6b21\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65f6\u95f4\"\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\"\u6d41\u884c\u5ea6\u6096\u8bba\"\uff1a\u4e24\u4e2a\u5b50\u7248\u5757\u4e2d\u9ad8\u53ef\u89c1\u5ea6\u8ba8\u8bba\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7ebf\u7d22\u663e\u8457\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6216\u5b8c\u5168\u7f3a\u5931\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f4e\u53ef\u89c1\u5ea6\u7ebf\u7a0b\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65f6\u95f4\u6ede\u540e\u521b\u9020\u4e86\"\u53d9\u4e8b\u9501\u5b9a\"\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7a97\u53e3\u671f\u3002", "conclusion": "\"\u53ef\u89c1\u5ea6\u5373\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\"\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9AI\u5b89\u5168\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\"\u8ba4\u77e5\u6469\u64e6\"\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\uff0c\u4ee5\u91cd\u65b0\u5e73\u8861\u53c2\u4e0e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u65e9\u671f\u672a\u7ecf\u8bc1\u5b9e\u7684\u8bf4\u6cd5\u56fa\u5316\u4e3a\u96c6\u4f53\u504f\u89c1\u3002"}}

Prior work characterizing how large language models are used has focused on private, one-on-one interactions. Grok's deployment on X represents a major departure from this setting, with interactions occurring in a public social space. In this paper, we systematically sample three months of interaction data to investigate how, when, and to what effect Grok is used on X. At the platform level, we find that Grok responds to 62% of requests, that the majority (51%) are in English, and that engagement is low, with half of Grok's responses receiving 20 or fewer views after 48 hours. We also inductively build a taxonomy of 10 roles that LLMs play in mediating social interactions and use these roles to analyze 41,735 interactions with Grok on X. We find that Grok most often serves as an information provider but, in contrast to LLM use in private one-on-one settings, also takes on roles related to dispute management, such as truth arbiter, advocate, and adversary. Finally, we characterize the population of X users who prompted Grok and find that their self-expressed interests are closely related to the roles the model assumes in the corresponding interactions. Our findings provide an initial quantitative description of human-AI interactions on X, and a broader understanding of the diverse roles that large language models might play in our online social spaces.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e86xAI\u7684Grok\u5728X\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u7684\u516c\u5f00\u4f7f\u7528\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u4e3b\u8981\u7528\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u4f9b\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u627f\u62c5\u4e89\u8bae\u7ba1\u7406\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u5174\u8da3\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u89d2\u8272\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8LLM\u5728\u79c1\u5bc6\u4e00\u5bf9\u4e00\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u800cGrok\u5728X\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u7684\u516c\u5f00\u90e8\u7f72\u4ee3\u8868\u4e86\u5b8c\u5168\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u793e\u4ea4\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u8fd9\u79cd\u516c\u5f00\u793e\u4ea4\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684AI\u4ea4\u4e92\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u91c7\u6837\u4e09\u4e2a\u6708\u4ea4\u4e92\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5e73\u53f0\u7ea7\u4f7f\u7528\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5f52\u7eb3\u6784\u5efa10\u79cdLLM\u5728\u793e\u4ea4\u4e92\u52a8\u4e2d\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u679041,735\u6b21Grok\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8c03\u67e5\u7528\u6237\u7fa4\u4f53\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "Grok\u54cd\u5e9462%\u8bf7\u6c42\uff0c51%\u4e3a\u82f1\u8bed\uff0c\u4e92\u52a8\u7387\u4f4e\uff08\u534a\u6570\u56de\u590d48\u5c0f\u65f6\u5185\u4ec5\u83b720\u6b21\u6d4f\u89c8\uff09\uff1b\u5f52\u7eb3\u51fa10\u79cd\u89d2\u8272\uff0cGrok\u4e3b\u8981\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u4f9b\u8005\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u627f\u62c5\u4e89\u8bae\u7ba1\u7406\u89d2\u8272\uff08\u771f\u76f8\u4ef2\u88c1\u8005\u3001\u5021\u5bfc\u8005\u3001\u5bf9\u624b\uff09\uff1b\u7528\u6237\u5174\u8da3\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u89d2\u8272\u5bc6\u5207\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u91cf\u5316\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e86X\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u7684\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86LLM\u5728\u5728\u7ebf\u793e\u4ea4\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u626e\u6f14\u7684\u591a\u6837\u5316\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4e89\u8bae\u7ba1\u7406\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u516c\u5f00\u793e\u4ea4\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684AI\u4f7f\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

PBSAI organizes responsibilities into a twelve domain taxonomy and defines bounded agent families that mediate between tools and policy through shared context envelopes and structured output contracts. The architecture assumes baseline enterprise security capabilities and encodes key systems security techniques, including analytic monitoring, coordinated defense, and adaptive response. A lightweight formal model of agents, context envelopes, and ecosystem level invariants clarifies the traceability, provenance, and human in the loop guarantees enforced across domains.

Language AI - the technologies that underpin widely-used conversational systems such as ChatGPT - could provide major benefits if available in people's native languages, yet most of the world's 7,000+ linguistic communities currently lack access and face persistent digital marginalization. Here we present a global longitudinal analysis of social, economic and infrastructural conditions across languages to assess systemic inequalities in language AI. We first analyze the existence of AI resources for 6003 languages. We find that despite efforts of the community to broaden the reach of language technologies (Bapna et al., 2022; Costa-Juss\u00e0 et al., 2022), the dominance of a handful of languages is exacerbating disparities on an unprecedented scale, with divides widening exponentially rather than narrowing. Further, we contrast the longitudinal diffusion of AI with that of earlier IT technologies, revealing a distinctive hype-driven pattern of spread. To translate our findings into practical insights and guide prioritization efforts, we introduce the Language AI Readiness Index (EQUATE), which maps the state of technological, socio-economic, and infrastructural prerequisites for AI deployment across languages. The index highlights communities where capacity exists but remains underutilized, and provides a framework for accelerating more equitable diffusion of language AI. Our work contributes to setting the baseline for a transition towards more sustainable and equitable language technologies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5168\u74036003\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u7684AI\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5c11\u6570\u8bed\u8a00\u4e3b\u5bfc\u52a0\u5267\u4e86\u6570\u5b57\u9e3f\u6c9f\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00AI\u51c6\u5907\u5ea6\u6307\u6570\uff08EQUATE\uff09\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u66f4\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u6280\u672f\u6269\u6563\u3002", "motivation": "AI\u6280\u672f\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u6539\u53d8\u533b\u7597\u3001\u6559\u80b2\u3001\u6cbb\u7406\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u516c\u5e73\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u597d\u5904\u76ee\u524d\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u5c11\u6570\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\uff0c\u5168\u74037000\u591a\u4e2a\u8bed\u8a00\u793e\u533a\u5927\u591a\u7f3a\u4e4fAI\u8bbf\u95ee\uff0c\u9762\u4e34\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u8fb9\u7f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "1. \u5bf96003\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u7684AI\u8d44\u6e90\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u7403\u7eb5\u5411\u5206\u6790\uff1b2. \u5bf9\u6bd4AI\u4e0e\u65e9\u671fIT\u6280\u672f\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b3. \u5f15\u5165\u8bed\u8a00AI\u51c6\u5907\u5ea6\u6307\u6570\uff08EQUATE\uff09\uff0c\u4ece\u6280\u672f\u3001\u793e\u4f1a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u548c\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u5404\u8bed\u8a00\u7684AI\u90e8\u7f72\u51c6\u5907\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a\u5c3d\u7ba1\u793e\u533a\u52aa\u529b\u6269\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6280\u672f\u8986\u76d6\uff0c\u4f46\u5c11\u6570\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u652f\u914d\u5730\u4f4d\u6b63\u5728\u4ee5\u524d\u6240\u672a\u6709\u7684\u89c4\u6a21\u52a0\u5267\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\uff0c\u9e3f\u6c9f\u5448\u6307\u6570\u7ea7\u6269\u5927\u800c\u975e\u7f29\u5c0f\u3002AI\u6269\u6563\u5448\u73b0\u51fa\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u7092\u4f5c\u9a71\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e0e\u65e9\u671fIT\u6280\u672f\u4e0d\u540c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86EQUATE\u6307\u6570\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u4f46\u672a\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u793e\u533a\uff0c\u4e3a\u52a0\u901f\u8bed\u8a00AI\u66f4\u516c\u5e73\u6269\u6563\u63d0\u4f9b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u5411\u66f4\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6280\u672f\u8fc7\u6e21\u8bbe\u5b9a\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002"}}

However, the foundational \"ground truth\" paradigm rests on a positivistic fallacy that treats human disagreement as technical noise rather than a vital sociotechnical signal. This systematic literature review analyzes research published between 2020 and 2025 across seven premier venues: ACL, AIES, CHI, CSCW, EAAMO, FAccT, and NeurIPS, investigating the mechanisms in data annotation practices that facilitate this \"consensus trap\". Our identification phase captured 30,897 records, which were refined via a tiered keyword filtration schema to a high-recall corpus of 3,042 records for manual screening, resulting in a final included corpus of 346 papers for qualitative synthesis. Our reflexive thematic analysis reveals that systemic failures in positional legibility, combined with the recent architectural shift toward human-as-verifier models, specifically the reliance on model-mediated annotations, introduce deep-seated anchoring bias and effectively remove human voices from the loop. We further demonstrate how geographic hegemony imposes Western norms as universal benchmarks, often enforced by the performative alignment of precarious data workers who prioritize requester compliance over honest subjectivity to avoid economic penalties. Critiquing the \"noisy sensor\" fallacy, where statistical models misdiagnose cultural pluralism as random error, we argue for reclaiming disagreement as a high-fidelity signal essential for building culturally competent models. To address these systemic tensions, we propose a roadmap for pluralistic annotation infrastructures that shift the objective from discovering a singular \"right\" answer to mapping the diversity of human experience.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u6279\u5224\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\"ground truth\"\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u5171\u8bc6\u9677\u9631\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u6570\u636e\u6807\u6ce8\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4ece\u8ffd\u6c42\u5355\u4e00\u6b63\u786e\u7b54\u6848\u8f6c\u5411\u6620\u5c04\u4eba\u7c7b\u7ecf\u9a8c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u591a\u5143\u6807\u6ce8\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5c06\"ground truth\"\u89c6\u4e3a\u5ba2\u89c2\u6b63\u786e\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e00\u8303\u5f0f\u5b58\u5728\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4e3b\u4e49\u8c2c\u8bef\uff0c\u5c06\u4eba\u7c7b\u5206\u6b67\u89c6\u4e3a\u6280\u672f\u566a\u58f0\u800c\u975e\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u6280\u672f\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63ed\u793a\u6570\u636e\u6807\u6ce8\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u5bfc\u81f4\"\u5171\u8bc6\u9677\u9631\"\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6279\u5224\u897f\u65b9\u89c4\u8303\u4f5c\u4e3a\u666e\u904d\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u5730\u7406\u9738\u6743\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4ecb\u6807\u6ce8\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u951a\u5b9a\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "method": "\u5bf92020-2025\u5e74\u95f4\u4e03\u4e2a\u9876\u7ea7\u4f1a\u8bae\uff08ACL\u3001AIES\u3001CHI\u3001CSCW\u3001EAAMO\u3001FAccT\u3001NeurIPS\uff09\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\u8fc7\u6ee4\u65b9\u6848\u4ece30,897\u6761\u8bb0\u5f55\u7b5b\u9009\u52303,042\u6761\u9ad8\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u8bed\u6599\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u7eb3\u5165346\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9a\u6027\u7efc\u5408\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u53cd\u601d\u6027\u4e3b\u9898\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a1\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u4f4d\u7f6e\u53ef\u8bfb\u6027\u5931\u8d25\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8005\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u8f6c\u53d8\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff1b2\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4ecb\u6807\u6ce8\u5f15\u5165\u6df1\u5c42\u951a\u5b9a\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u5b9e\u8d28\u4e0a\u5c06\u4eba\u7c7b\u58f0\u97f3\u6392\u9664\u5728\u5faa\u73af\u4e4b\u5916\uff1b3\uff09\u5730\u7406\u9738\u6743\u5c06\u897f\u65b9\u89c4\u8303\u5f3a\u52a0\u4e3a\u666e\u904d\u57fa\u51c6\uff1b4\uff09\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5de5\u4f5c\u8005\u4e3a\u89c4\u907f\u7ecf\u6d4e\u60e9\u7f5a\u800c\u4f18\u5148\u6ee1\u8db3\u8bf7\u6c42\u8005\u5408\u89c4\u800c\u975e\u8bda\u5b9e\u4e3b\u89c2\u6027\uff1b5\uff09\u7edf\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u5c06\u6587\u5316\u591a\u5143\u6027\u8bef\u8bca\u4e3a\u968f\u673a\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\"\u566a\u58f0\u4f20\u611f\u5668\"\u8c2c\u8bef\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u4e3b\u5f20\u5c06\u5206\u6b67\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u6587\u5316\u80dc\u4efb\u6a21\u578b\u6240\u9700\u7684\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u5143\u6807\u6ce8\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u8def\u7ebf\u56fe\uff0c\u5c06\u76ee\u6807\u4ece\u53d1\u73b0\u5355\u4e00\"\u6b63\u786e\"\u7b54\u6848\u8f6c\u5411\u6620\u5c04\u4eba\u7c7b\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002"}}

Despite their success, aligning LLM-based evaluations with human judgments remains challenging. While supervised fine-tuning on human-labeled data can improve alignment, it is costly and inflexible, requiring new training for each task or dataset. Recent progress in auto prompt optimization (APO) offers a more efficient alternative by automatically improving the instructions that guide LLM judges. However, existing APO methods primarily target text-only evaluations and remain underexplored in multimodal settings. In this work, we study auto prompt optimization for multimodal LLM-as-a-judge, particularly for evaluating AI-generated images. We identify a key bottleneck: multimodal models can only process a limited number of visual examples due to context window constraints, which hinders effective trial-and-error prompt refinement. To overcome this, we propose BLPO, a bi-level prompt optimization framework that converts images into textual representations while preserving evaluation-relevant visual cues. Our bi-level optimization approach jointly refines the judge prompt and the I2T prompt to maintain fidelity under limited context budgets. Experiments on four datasets and three LLM judges demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.", "AI": {"tldr": "BLPO\uff1a\u9488\u5bf9\u591a\u6a21\u6001LLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u53cc\u5c42\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u56fe\u50cf\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u6587\u672c\u8868\u793a\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a97\u53e3\u9650\u5236\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347AI\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dLLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30AI\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u65f6\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\u5b58\u5728\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u4e0d\u7075\u6d3b\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u7eaf\u6587\u672c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u56e0\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a97\u53e3\u9650\u5236\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u5927\u91cf\u89c6\u89c9\u793a\u4f8b\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8bd5\u9519\u5f0f\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faBLPO\uff08Bi-Level Prompt Optimization\uff09\u53cc\u5c42\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u5c06\u56fe\u50cf\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u6587\u672c\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u8bc4\u4f30\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u7ebf\u7d22\uff1b2\uff09\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u6587\u672c\u8f6c\u6362\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u6709\u9650\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4e09\u4e2aLLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6a21\u6001LLM\u8bc4\u4f30AI\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "BLPO\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u56fe\u50cf\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u6587\u672c\u8868\u793a\u5e76\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001LLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a97\u53e3\u9650\u5236\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3aAI\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, their performance in real-world deployments often that observed on benchmark settings, especially in complex and imperfect environments. This discrepancy largely arises because prevailing training and evaluation paradigms are typically built on idealized assumptions, overlooking the inherent stochasticity and noise present in real-world interactions. To bridge this gap, we introduce AgentNoiseBench, a framework for systematically evaluating the robustness of agentic models under noisy environments. We first conduct an in-depth analysis of biases and uncertainties in real-world scenarios and categorize environmental noise into two primary types: user-noise and tool-noise.

The analysis employed a rigorous pipeline combining hybrid color normalization, facial landmark masking, and perceptually uniform skin tone quantification using the Monk (MST), PERLA, and Fitzpatrick scales. Neutral prompts produced highly polarized defaults. Both models exhibited a strong \"default white\" bias (>96% of outputs). However, they diverged sharply on gender: Gemini favored female-presenting subjects, while GPT favored male-presenting subjects with lighter skin tones. This research provides a large-scale, comparative audit of state-of-the-art models using an illumination-aware colorimetric methodology, distinguishing aesthetic rendering from underlying pigmentation in synthetic imagery. The study demonstrates that neutral prompts function as diagnostic probes rather than neutral instructions.

Agentic reinforcement learning (RL) has recently emerged as a promising solution for training such agents in multi-turn settings, allowing interaction strategies to be learned from feedback. However, existing pipelines face a critical challenge in balancing task performance with user engagement, as passive agents can not efficiently adapt to users' intentions while overuse of human feedback reduces their satisfaction. To address this trade-off, we propose BAO, an agentic RL framework that combines behavior enhancement to enrich proactive reasoning and information-gathering capabilities with behavior regularization to suppress inefficient or redundant interactions and align agent behavior with user expectations. We evaluate BAO on multiple tasks from the UserRL benchmark suite, and demonstrate that it substantially outperforms proactive agentic RL baselines while achieving comparable or even superior performance to commercial LLM agents, highlighting its effectiveness for training proactive, user-aligned LLM agents in complex multi-turn scenarios.

Here, we study this failure mode in a high-stakes task: the transcription of U.S. street names as spoken by U.S. participants. We evaluate 15 models from OpenAI, Deepgram, Google, and Microsoft on recordings from linguistically diverse U.S. speakers and find an average transcription error rate of 44%. We quantify the downstream impact of failed transcriptions by geographic locations and show that mis-transcriptions systematically cause errors for all speakers, but that routing distance errors are twice as large for non-English primary speakers compared to English primary speakers. To mitigate this harm, we introduce a synthetic data generation approach that produces diverse pronunciations of named entities using open-source text-to-speech models. Fine-tuning with less than 1,000 synthetic samples improves street name transcription accuracy by nearly 60% (relative to base models) for non-English primary speakers.

Existing benchmarks focus primarily on the computational aspect of this task, testing agents' ability to reproduce or replicate research outcomes when having access to the code and data. This setting, while foundational, (1) fails to capture the inconsistent availability of new data for replication as opposed to reproduction, and (2) lacks ground-truth diversity by focusing only on reproducible papers, thereby failing to evaluate an agent's ability to identify non-replicable research. Furthermore, most benchmarks only evaluate outcomes rather than the replication process. In response, we introduce ReplicatorBench, an end-to-end benchmark, including human-verified replicable and non-replicable research claims in social and behavioral sciences for evaluating AI agents in research replication across three stages: (1) extraction and retrieval of replication data; (2) design and execution of computational experiments; and (3) interpretation of results, allowing a test of AI agents' capability to mimic the activities of human replicators in real world. To set a baseline of AI agents' capability, we develop ReplicatorAgent, an agentic framework equipped with necessary tools, like web search and iterative interaction with sandboxed environments, to accomplish tasks in ReplicatorBench. We evaluate ReplicatorAgent across four underlying large language models (LLMs), as well as different design choices of programming language and levels of code access. Our findings reveal that while current LLM agents are capable of effectively designing and executing computational experiments, they struggle with retrieving resources, such as new data, necessary to replicate a claim.

While object-centric representations provide a useful abstraction, they are not sufficient to capture interaction-dependent dynamics. We therefore propose C-JEPA, a simple and flexible object-centric world model that extends masked joint embedding prediction from image patches to object-centric representations. By applying object-level masking that requires an object's state to be inferred from other objects, C-JEPA induces latent interventions with counterfactual-like effects and prevents shortcut solutions, making interaction reasoning essential. Empirically, C-JEPA leads to consistent gains in visual question answering, with an absolute improvement of about 20\\% in counterfactual reasoning compared to the same architecture without object-level masking. On agent control tasks, C-JEPA enables substantially more efficient planning by using only 1\\% of the total latent input features required by patch-based world models, while achieving comparable performance.

Standard pruning methods fail to address this bottleneck: unstructured sparsity leaves activations dense, magnitude-based selection ignores runtime dynamics, and gradient-based methods impose prohibitive costs. We introduce GHOST (Grouped Hidden-state Output-aware Selection and Truncation), a structured pruning framework that approximates control-theoretic balanced truncation using only forward-pass statistics. By jointly measuring controllability and observability, GHOST rivals the fidelity of gradient-based methods without requiring backpropagation. As a highlight, on models ranging from 130M to 2.7B parameters, our approach achieves a 50\\% state-dimension reduction with approximately 1 perplexity point increase on WikiText-2.

Existing uncertainty proxies focus on single-shot text generation and therefore miss these trajectory-level breakdown signals. We introduce TRACER, a trajectory-level uncertainty metric for dual-control Tool-Agent-User interaction. TRACER combines content-aware surprisal with situational-awareness signals, semantic and lexical repetition, and tool-grounded coherence gaps, and aggregates them using a tail-focused risk functional with a MAX-composite step risk to surface decisive anomalies. We evaluate TRACER on $\u03c4^2$-bench by predicting task failure and selective task execution. To this end, TRACER improves AUROC by up to 37.1% and AUARC by up to 55% over baselines, enabling earlier and more accurate detection of uncertainty in complex conversational tool-use settings.

However, the reliability of this recipe in real-world settings remains unreliable due to environmental uncertainties arising from the sim-to-real gap, model mismatch, and system noise. We address this gap by introducing Distributionally robust IGM (DrIGM), a principle that requires each agent's robust greedy action to align with the robust team-optimal joint action. We show that DrIGM holds for a novel definition of robust individual action values, which is compatible with decentralized greedy execution and yields a provable robustness guarantee for the whole system. Building on this foundation, we derive DrIGM-compliant robust variants of existing value-factorization architectures (e.g., VDN/QMIX/QTRAN) that (i) train on robust Q-targets, (ii) preserve scalability, and (iii) integrate seamlessly with existing codebases without bespoke per-agent reward shaping.

We explore multimodal RLVR through the lens of cross-modal attention connectivity and find that only a small fraction of tokens (approximately 15%) exhibit strong visual-textual coupling. These high-connectivity tokens act as anchors that ground reasoning in the image, while the majority follow linguistic patterns. During RLVR training, credit assignment naturally concentrates on these anchors, sharpening their visual grounding over time. Building on this insight, we propose Anchor-Token Reinforcement Learning (AT-RL), a lightweight framework that selectively reinforces high-connectivity tokens via graph-based clustering of attention topology. Evaluated across the series (3B-32B), AT-RL introduces only 1.2% overhead yet enables the 32B model to surpass the 72B-Instruct baseline on MathVista (80.2), with consistent gains observed across STEM, video and general tasks. Conversely, training solely on low-connectivity tokens causes severe degradation, confirming that effective multimodal RL hinges on precise credit assignment to visual anchors.

Code and dataset available at https://github.com/Privatris/AgentLeak", "summary": "Multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) systems create privacy risks that current benchmarks cannot measure. When agents coordinate on tasks, sensitive data passes through inter-agent messages, shared memory, and tool arguments; pathways that output-only audits never inspect. We introduce AgentLeak, to the best of our knowledge the first full-stack benchmark for privacy leakage covering internal channels, spanning 1,000 scenarios across healthcare, finance, legal, and corporate domains, paired with a 32-class attack taxonomy and three-tier detection pipeline. Testing GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Mistral Large, and Llama 3.3 70B across 4,979 traces reveals that multi-agent configurations reduce per-channel output leakage (C1: 27.2% vs 43.2% in single-agent) but introduce unmonitored internal channels that raise total system exposure to 68.9% (OR-aggregated across C1, C2, C5). Internal channels account for most of this gap: inter-agent messages (C2) leak at 68.8%, compared to 27.2% on C1 (output channel). This means that output-only audits miss 41.7% of violations. Claude 3.5 Sonnet, which emphasizes safety alignment in its design, achieves the lowest leakage rates on both external (3.3%) and internal (28.1%) channels, suggesting that model-level safety training may transfer to internal channel protection. Across all five models and four domains, the pattern C2 > C1 holds consistently, confirming that inter-agent communication is the primary vulnerability. These findings underscore the need for coordination frameworks that incorporate internal-channel privacy protections and enforce privacy controls on inter-agent communication.", "AI": {"tldr": "AgentLeak\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53LLM\u7cfb\u7edf\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u7684\u5168\u6808\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u5185\u90e8\u901a\u4fe1\u901a\u9053\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8f93\u51fa\u5ba1\u8ba1\u4f1a\u9057\u6f0f41.7%\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u8fdd\u89c4\uff0c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u95f4\u6d88\u606f\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u6d4b\u91cf\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53LLM\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u654f\u611f\u6570\u636e\u4f1a\u901a\u8fc7\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u95f4\u6d88\u606f\u3001\u5171\u4eab\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u53c2\u6570\u7b49\u5185\u90e8\u901a\u9053\u4f20\u9012\uff0c\u800c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u901a\u9053\u5728\u4ec5\u8f93\u51fa\u5ba1\u8ba1\u4e2d\u4ece\u672a\u88ab\u68c0\u67e5\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165AgentLeak\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b1000\u4e2a\u8de8\u533b\u7597\u3001\u91d1\u878d\u3001\u6cd5\u5f8b\u548c\u4f01\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u914d\u590732\u7c7b\u653b\u51fb\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\u548c\u4e09\u5c42\u68c0\u6d4b\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e86GPT-4o\u3001Claude 3.5 Sonnet\u7b495\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u51714979\u6761\u8ffd\u8e2a\u8bb0\u5f55\u3002", "result": "\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u914d\u7f6e\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5355\u901a\u9053\u8f93\u51fa\u6cc4\u9732\uff0827.2% vs 43.2%\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u672a\u76d1\u63a7\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u901a\u9053\u4f7f\u7cfb\u7edf\u603b\u66b4\u9732\u7387\u8fbe\u523068.9%\u3002\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u95f4\u6d88\u606f\u6cc4\u9732\u7387\u9ad8\u8fbe68.8%\uff0c\u8f93\u51fa\u5ba1\u8ba1\u4f1a\u9057\u6f0f41.7%\u7684\u8fdd\u89c4\u3002Claude 3.5 Sonnet\u5728\u5916\u90e8\uff083.3%\uff09\u548c\u5185\u90e8\uff0828.1%\uff09\u901a\u9053\u4e0a\u6cc4\u9732\u7387\u6700\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u95f4\u901a\u4fe1\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u9690\u79c1\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u534f\u8c03\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u6574\u5408\u5185\u90e8\u901a\u9053\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u95f4\u901a\u4fe1\u5b9e\u65bd\u9690\u79c1\u63a7\u5236\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u7ea7\u5b89\u5168\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ef\u80fd\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5185\u90e8\u901a\u9053\u4fdd\u62a4\u3002"}}

However, most existing approaches primarily emphasize learning task-specific outputs or static knowledge representations, while overlooking the continuous refinement of internal reasoning structures, action scheduling policies, and learning mechanisms themselves. In this paper, we propose a human-inspired continuous learning framework that unifies reasoning, action, reflection, and verification within a sequential reasoning model enhanced by parallel learning. The framework explicitly treats internal thinking processes as primary learning objects. It systematically records internal reasoning trajectories and environmental interactions as structured learning material, enabling the system to optimize not only task-level content but also the organization, scheduling, and evolution of reasoning activities. This design realizes learning alongside processing, allowing cognitive structures to improve during execution. Furthermore, the framework supports controlled replacement of predefined logic with learned procedures and introduces a hierarchical learning-to-learn mechanism that jointly adapts task-level parameters and learning strategies. As a result, the system progressively evolves its internal cognitive architecture while preserving operational stability. Experimental results on a temperature sensor abnormality detection task show that incorporating internal-process learning reduces average runtime by 23.9%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u53d7\u4eba\u7c7b\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u884c\u52a8\u3001\u53cd\u601d\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7edf\u4e00\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u5c06\u5185\u90e8\u601d\u7ef4\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e3b\u8981\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u8c61\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8ba4\u77e5\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u6e10\u8fdb\u6f14\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u8f93\u51fa\u6216\u9759\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u800c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u5185\u90e8\u63a8\u7406\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u884c\u52a8\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\u672c\u8eab\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u5316\u3002\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73b0\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u6301\u7eed\u9002\u5e94\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u884c\u52a8\u3001\u53cd\u601d\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5185\u90e8\u601d\u7ef4\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e3b\u8981\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u8c61\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bb0\u5f55\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u73af\u5883\u4ea4\u4e92\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6750\u6599\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u903b\u8f91\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u53d7\u63a7\u66ff\u6362\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u5206\u5c42\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6e29\u5ea6\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u5185\u90e8\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u5c06\u5e73\u5747\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c1123.9%\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u64cd\u4f5c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6e10\u8fdb\u6f14\u5316\u5176\u5185\u90e8\u8ba4\u77e5\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5185\u90e8\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e3b\u8981\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u8c61\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8ba4\u77e5\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6301\u7eed\u9002\u5e94\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

However, traditional causal analysis workflows impose significant technical barriers, requiring researchers to possess dual backgrounds in statistics and computer science, while manually selecting algorithms, handling data quality issues, and interpreting complex results. To address these challenges, we propose CausalAgent, a conversational multi-agent system for end-to-end causal inference. The system innovatively integrates Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to achieve automation from data cleaning and causal structure learning to bias correction and report generation through natural language interaction.

This has been studied extensively under the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) formulation, which reduces the problem to finding some type of Steiner subgraph on a network. Group surveillance like wastewater or aerosol monitoring is a form of mass/pooled testing where samples from multiple individuals are pooled together and tested once for all. While a single negative test clears multiple individuals, a positive test does not reveal the infected individuals in the test pool. We introduce the POOLCASCADEMLE problem in the setting of a network propagation process, where the goal is to find a MLE cascade subgraph which is consistent with the pooled test outcomes. Previous work on reconstruction assumes that the test results are of individuals, i.e., pools of size one, and requires a consistent cascade to connect the positive testing nodes. In POOLCASCADEMLE, a consistent cascade must choose at least one node in each positive pool, adding another combinatorial layer. We show that, under the Independent Cascade (IC) model, POOLCASCADEMLE is NP-hard, and present an approximation algorithm based on a reduction to the Group Steiner Tree problem. We also consider a one-hop version of this problem, in which the disease can spread for one time step after being seeded. We show that even this restricted version is NP-hard, and develop a method using linear programming relaxation and rounding. We evaluate the performance of our methods on real and synthetic contact networks, in terms of missing infection recovery and prevalence estimation. We find that our approach outperforms meaningful baselines which correspond to pools of size one and use state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u7fa4\u4f53\u76d1\u6d4b\uff08\u5982\u5e9f\u6c34\u68c0\u6d4b\uff09\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\uff0c\u4ece\u90e8\u5206\u611f\u67d3\u4fe1\u606f\u91cd\u5efa\u75be\u75c5\u4f20\u64ad\u94fe\u7684MLE\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86POOLCASCADEMLE\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u5176NP\u96be\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eGroup Steiner Tree\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u75ab\u60c5\u7206\u53d1\u671f\u95f4\uff0c\u4ece\u90e8\u5206\u786e\u8ba4\u611f\u67d3\u4fe1\u606f\u91cd\u5efa\u75be\u75c5\u4f20\u64ad\u94fe\u662f\u5173\u952e\u7684\u516c\u5171\u536b\u751f\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u4e2a\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4f46\u7fa4\u4f53\u76d1\u6d4b\uff08\u5982\u5e9f\u6c34\u68c0\u6d4b\uff09\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u662f\u7fa4\u4f53\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u9633\u6027\u7ed3\u679c\u65e0\u6cd5\u786e\u5b9a\u5177\u4f53\u611f\u67d3\u8005\uff0c\u8fd9\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002", "method": "1. \u63d0\u51faPOOLCASCADEMLE\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u72ec\u7acb\u7ea7\u8054\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u8bc1\u660e\u5176NP\u96be\u6027\uff1b2. \u57fa\u4e8eGroup Steiner Tree\u95ee\u9898\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b3. \u9488\u5bf9\u5355\u8df3\u4f20\u64ad\u7248\u672c\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u677e\u5f1b\u548c\u820d\u5165\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b4. \u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u548c\u5408\u6210\u63a5\u89e6\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "1. \u8bc1\u660ePOOLCASCADEMLE\u5728\u72ec\u7acb\u7ea7\u8054\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u662fNP\u96be\u95ee\u9898\uff1b2. \u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u7f3a\u5931\u611f\u67d3\u6062\u590d\u548c\u6d41\u884c\u7387\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b3. \u5373\u4f7f\u5355\u8df3\u4f20\u64ad\u7248\u672c\u4e5f\u662fNP\u96be\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7fa4\u4f53\u76d1\u6d4b\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u75be\u75c5\u4f20\u64ad\u94fe\u91cd\u5efa\u95ee\u9898\u5177\u6709\u989d\u5916\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u8fc7\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff08\u5982Group Steiner Tree\u7ea6\u7b80\u548c\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\uff09\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u4e2a\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Existing population synthesis approaches predominantly rely on structured attributes and statistical constraints, leaving a gap in semantic-conditioned population generation that can capture abstract behavioral patterns implicitly in survey data. This study proposes SemaPop, a semantic-statistical population synthesis model that integrates large language models (LLMs) with generative population modeling. SemaPop derives high-level persona representations from individual survey records and incorporates them as semantic conditioning signals for population generation, while marginal regularization is introduced to enforce alignment with target population marginals. In this study, the framework is instantiated using a Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty (WGAN-GP) backbone, referred to as SemaPop-GAN. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SemaPop-GAN achieves improved generative performance, yielding closer alignment with target marginal and joint distributions while maintaining sample-level feasibility and diversity under semantic conditioning.

In dynamic, partially observable environments, communication is often what reduces uncertainty and makes collaboration possible. This survey reviews multi-agent communication (MA-Comm) through the Five Ws: who communicates with whom, what is communicated, when communication occurs, and why communication is beneficial. This framing offers a clean way to connect ideas across otherwise separate research threads. We trace how communication approaches have evolved across three major paradigms. In Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), early methods used hand-designed or implicit protocols, followed by end-to-end learned communication optimized for reward and control. While successful, these protocols are frequently task-specific and hard to interpret, motivating work on Emergent Language (EL), where agents can develop more structured or symbolic communication through interaction. EL methods, however, still struggle with grounding, generalization, and scalability, which has fueled recent interest in large language models (LLMs) that bring natural language priors for reasoning, planning, and collaboration in more open-ended settings. Across MARL, EL, and LLM-based systems, we highlight how different choices shape communication design, where the main trade-offs lie, and what remains unsolved. We distill practical design patterns and open challenges to support future hybrid systems that combine learning, language, and control for scalable and interpretable multi-agent collaboration.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u7efc\u8ff0\u7cfb\u7edf\u56de\u987e\u4e86\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u901a\u4fe1\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u6f14\u8fdb\uff0c\u4ece\u65e9\u671fMARL\u4e2d\u7684\u624b\u5de5/\u9690\u5f0f\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u5230\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5b66\u4e60\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u518d\u5230\u6d8c\u73b0\u8bed\u8a00\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u5230\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u534f\u4f5c\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u901a\u4fe1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u4e94\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff08\u8c01\u3001\u4e0e\u8c01\u3001\u4ec0\u4e48\u3001\u4f55\u65f6\u3001\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\uff09\u548c\u4e3b\u8981\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u4fe1\u662f\u51cf\u5c11\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u73b0\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u5173\u952e\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6563\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8303\u5f0f\uff08MARL\u3001\u6d8c\u73b0\u8bed\u8a00\u3001LLM\uff09\u4e2d\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u7406\u89e3\u901a\u4fe1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3001\u6743\u8861\u548c\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\"\u4e94\u4e2aW\"\u6846\u67b6\uff08\u8c01\u4e0e\u8c01\u901a\u4fe1\u3001\u901a\u4fe1\u4ec0\u4e48\u3001\u4f55\u65f6\u901a\u4fe1\u3001\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u901a\u4fe1\uff09\u6765\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u901a\u4fe1\u3002\u8ffd\u6eaf\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u6f14\u8fdb\uff1a\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08MARL\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u534f\u8bae\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u6d8c\u73b0\u8bed\u8a00\uff08EL\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u534f\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "result": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u68b3\u7406\u4e86\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u901a\u4fe1\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u6f14\u8fdb\u8def\u5f84\uff1a\u4eceMARL\u7684\u624b\u5de5/\u9690\u5f0f\u534f\u8bae\u5230\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5b66\u4e60\u901a\u4fe1\uff08\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u4f46\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5dee\uff09\uff0c\u5230\u6d8c\u73b0\u8bed\u8a00\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u8ffd\u6c42\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u63a5\u5730\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u6311\u6218\uff09\uff0c\u518d\u5230LLM\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5148\u9a8c\u8fdb\u884c\u5f00\u653e\u73af\u5883\u63a8\u7406\uff09\u3002\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u548c\u4e3b\u8981\u6743\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u901a\u4fe1\u7814\u7a76\u6b63\u671d\u7740\u7ed3\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u53d1\u5c55\u3002\u672a\u6765\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u7b49\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u5f00\u653e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

Yet existing RL post-training pipelines treat all input signals as equally relevant, ignoring which modalities each task actually requires. This modality-blind training inflates policy-gradient variance, slows convergence, and degrades robustness to real-world distribution shifts where signals may be missing, added, or reweighted. We introduce MAPLE, a complete modality-aware post-training and learning ecosystem comprising: (1) MAPLE-bench, the first benchmark explicitly annotating minimal signal combinations required per task; (2) MAPO, a modality-aware policy optimization framework that stratifies batches by modality requirement to reduce gradient variance from heterogeneous group advantages; (3) Adaptive weighting and curriculum scheduling that balances and prioritizes harder signal combinations. Systematic analysis across loss aggregation, clipping, sampling, and curriculum design establishes MAPO's optimal training strategy.

A common challenge arises from solving the PDE families, which are characterized by sharing an identical mathematical structure but varying in specific parameters. Traditional numerical methods, such as the finite element method, need to independently solve each instance within a PDE family, which incurs massive computational cost. On the other hand, while recent advancements in machine learning PDE solvers offer impressive computational speed and accuracy, their inherent ``black-box\" nature presents a considerable limitation. These methods primarily yield numerical approximations, thereby lacking the crucial interpretability provided by analytical expressions, which are essential for deeper scientific insight. To address these limitations, we propose a neuro-assisted multitasking symbolic PDE solver framework for PDE family solving, dubbed NMIPS. In particular, we employ multifactorial optimization to simultaneously discover the analytical solutions of PDEs. To enhance computational efficiency, we devise an affine transfer method by transferring learned mathematical structures among PDEs in a family, avoiding solving each PDE from scratch.

This striking gap highlights spatial reasoning as a fundamental weakness of current models. To investigate this gap, we present MathSpatial, a unified framework for evaluating and improving spatial reasoning in MLLMs. MathSpatial includes three complementary components: (i) MathSpatial-Bench, a benchmark of 2K problems across three categories and eleven subtypes, designed to isolate reasoning difficulty from perceptual noise; (ii) MathSpatial-Corpus, a training dataset of 8K additional problems with verified solutions; and (iii) MathSpatial-SRT, which models reasoning as structured traces composed of three atomic operations--Correlate, Constrain, and Infer. Experiments show that fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL-7B on MathSpatial achieves competitive accuracy while reducing tokens by 25\\%.

Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback relies on preference annotations that are prohibitively expensive and often fail to reflect the absolute correctness of medical facts. Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards lacks effective automatic verifiers and struggles to handle complex clinical contexts. Meanwhile, medical alignment requires the simultaneous optimization of correctness, safety, and compliance, yet multi-objective heterogeneous reward signals are prone to scale mismatch and optimization conflicts.To address these challenges, we propose a robust medical alignment paradigm. We first construct a holistic multi-dimensional medical alignment matrix that decomposes alignment objectives into four categories: fundamental capabilities, expert knowledge, online feedback, and format specifications. Within each category, we establish a closed loop of where observable metrics inform attributable diagnosis, which in turn drives optimizable rewards, thereby providing fine-grained, high-resolution supervision signals for subsequent iterative optimization. To resolve gradient domination and optimization instability problem caused by heterogeneous signals, we further propose a unified optimization mechanism. This mechanism employs Reference-Frozen Normalization to align reward scales and implements a Tri-Factor Adaptive Dynamic Weighting strategy to achieve collaborative optimization that is weakness-oriented, risk-prioritized, and redundancy-reducing.

Reliance on purely semantic Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) often leads to \"context poisoning,\" where agents generate linguistically plausible but physically invalid configurations due to a fundamental Semantic-Physical Disconnect. To bridge this gap, this work introduces PhyNiKCE (Physical and Numerical Knowledgeable Context Engineering), a neurosymbolic agentic framework for trustworthy engineering. Unlike standard black-box agents, PhyNiKCE decouples neural planning from symbolic validation. It employs a Symbolic Knowledge Engine that treats simulation setup as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem, rigidly enforcing physical constraints via a Deterministic RAG Engine with specialized retrieval strategies for solvers, turbulence models, and boundary conditions. Validated through rigorous OpenFOAM experiments on practical, non-tutorial CFD tasks using Gemini-2.5-Pro/Flash, PhyNiKCE demonstrates a 96% relative improvement over state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, by replacing trial-and-error with knowledge-driven initialization, the framework reduced autonomous self-correction loops by 59% while simultaneously lowering LLM token consumption by 17%. These results demonstrate that decoupling neural generation from symbolic constraint enforcement significantly enhances robustness and efficiency.

By distilling 106 validated benchmarks from the technical reports of 91 representative models in 2025, we systematically characterize the evaluation landscape.

We show this pathology has a precise causal origin: autoregressive training provides no gradient signal to distinguish association P(Y|X) from intervention P(Y|do(X)), a failure we formalize as Rung Collapse. When outcome-based learning reinforces correct answers obtained through incorrect causal models, the agent becomes entrenched in flawed reasoning, a phenomenon we term Aleatoric Entrenchment. We propose Epistemic Regret Minimization (ERM), a belief revision objective that penalizes errors in causal reasoning independently of task success, and embed it within a three-layer architecture with three contributions grounded in knowledge representation: (1) a Physical Grounding Theorem proving that actions satisfying actuator independence implement valid do-operations, bridging action languages and do-calculus; (2) ERM as a causal belief revision operator satisfying AGM postulates, preventing entrenchment even when the agent succeeds for the wrong reasons; and (3) a failure mode taxonomy that classifies recurring reasoning errors and injects domain-independent guards, enabling cross-domain transfer. We prove asymptotic recovery of the true interventional distribution with finite-sample bounds. Experiments on 1,360 causal trap scenarios across six frontier LLMs reveal that Rung Collapse persists even in reasoning-enhanced models (3.7% for GPT-5.2), that steerability exhibits inverse scaling where advanced models resist generic correction, and that targeted ERM feedback recovers 53-59% of entrenched errors where outcome-level feedback fails.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faRung Collapse\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u5173\u8054\u4e0e\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\"\u6b63\u786e\u4f46\u7406\u7531\u9519\u8bef\"\uff1b\u63d0\u51faEpistemic Regret Minimization\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56e0\u679c\u4fe1\u5ff5\u4fee\u6b63\u9632\u6b62Aleatoric Entrenchment\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "motivation": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e38\u901a\u8fc7\u6377\u5f84\u83b7\u5f97\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u5d29\u6e83\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u75c5\u7406\u6709\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u8d77\u6e90\uff1a\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u5173\u8054P(Y|X)\u548c\u5e72\u9884P(Y|do(X))\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u4e8e\u9519\u8bef\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u83b7\u5f97\u6b63\u786e\u7b54\u6848\uff0c\u9677\u5165Aleatoric Entrenchment\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faEpistemic Regret Minimization(ERM)\u4f5c\u4e3a\u56e0\u679c\u4fe1\u5ff5\u4fee\u6b63\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u72ec\u7acb\u4e8e\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u60e9\u7f5a\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u5c42\u67b6\u6784\uff1a1)\u7269\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u5b9a\u7406\u8bc1\u660e\u6ee1\u8db3\u6267\u884c\u5668\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548do\u64cd\u4f5c\uff1b2)ERM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6ee1\u8db3AGM\u516c\u8bbe\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u4fe1\u5ff5\u4fee\u6b63\u7b97\u5b50\uff1b3)\u9519\u8bef\u6a21\u5f0f\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\u6ce8\u5165\u9886\u57df\u65e0\u5173\u9632\u62a4\u3002", "result": "\u57281,360\u4e2a\u56e0\u679c\u9677\u9631\u573a\u666f\u548c6\u4e2a\u524d\u6cbfLLM\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff1aRung Collapse\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u6301\u7eed\u5b58\u5728(GPT-5.2\u4ec53.7%)\uff1b\u53ef\u64cd\u7eb5\u6027\u5448\u73b0\u9006\u7f29\u653e\u73b0\u8c61\uff1b\u9488\u5bf9\u6027ERM\u53cd\u9988\u80fd\u6062\u590d53-59%\u7684\u987d\u56fa\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u800c\u7ed3\u679c\u7ea7\u53cd\u9988\u5931\u8d25\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e86Rung Collapse\u4f5c\u4e3a\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6839\u672c\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u51faERM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6e10\u8fd1\u6062\u590d\u771f\u5b9e\u5e72\u9884\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u9632\u6b62\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u9519\u8bef\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Accepted to ICASSP 2026", "summary": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable progress in visual understanding, yet they suffer from a critical limitation: structural blindness. Even state-of-the-art models fail to capture topology and symbolic logic in engineering schematics, as their pixel-driven paradigm discards the explicit vector-defined relations needed for reasoning. To overcome this, we propose a Vector-to-Graph (V2G) pipeline that converts CAD diagrams into property graphs where nodes represent components and edges encode connectivity, making structural dependencies explicit and machine-auditable. On a diagnostic benchmark of electrical compliance checks, V2G yields large accuracy gains across all error categories, while leading MLLMs remain near chance level. These results highlight the systemic inadequacy of pixel-based methods and demonstrate that structure-aware representations provide a reliable path toward practical deployment of multimodal AI in engineering domains.

Analysis of model confidence dynamics under latent reasoning reveals that thinking trajectories ending in incorrect answers contain fewer low-confidence steps than those ending in correct answers. Meanwhile, we suggest that soft embeddings aggregated by multiple low-confidence thinking alternatives may introduce and propagate noise, leading to high confidence in unreliable reasoning trajectories. Motivated by these observations, ThinkRouter, an inference-time confidence-aware routing mechanism is proposed to avoid high confidence and noise for efficient reasoning. ThinkRouter routes thinking to the discrete token space when model confidence is low, and to the latent space otherwise. Extensive experiments on STEM reasoning and coding benchmarks across diverse large reasoning models demonstrate that ThinkRouter outperforms explicit CoT, random routing, and latent reasoning baselines in terms of accuracy, achieving an average improvement of 19.70 points in Pass@1, while reducing generation length by up to 15.55%. Further comprehensive analysis reveals that ThinkRouter can calibrate errors arising from explicit CoT and latent reasoning, and accelerates end-of-thinking token generation by globally lowering model confidence.", "AI": {"tldr": "ThinkRouter\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8def\u7531\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u6a21\u578b\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u5728\u79bb\u6563token\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e4b\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u5207\u6362\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6548\u679c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5dee\u5f02\u8f83\u5927\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a\u9519\u8bef\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u601d\u8003\u8f68\u8ff9\u5305\u542b\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u4f4e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u800c\u591a\u4e2a\u4f4e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u601d\u8003\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u805a\u5408\u7684\u8f6f\u5d4c\u5165\u53ef\u80fd\u5f15\u5165\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faThinkRouter\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8def\u7531\u673a\u5236\u3002\u5f53\u6a21\u578b\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4f4e\u65f6\uff0c\u5c06\u601d\u8003\u8def\u7531\u5230\u79bb\u6563token\u7a7a\u95f4\uff1b\u5f53\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u9ad8\u65f6\uff0c\u8def\u7531\u5230\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u5207\u6362\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5728STEM\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u7f16\u7a0b\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cThinkRouter\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u663e\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u3001\u968f\u673a\u8def\u7531\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0cPass@1\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u534719.70\u5206\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u751f\u6210\u957f\u5ea6\u51cf\u5c11\u8fbe15.55%\u3002", "conclusion": "ThinkRouter\u80fd\u591f\u6821\u51c6\u663e\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u5c40\u964d\u4f4e\u6a21\u578b\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u52a0\u901f\u601d\u8003\u7ed3\u675ftoken\u7684\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u3002"}}

However, existing merging methods largely rely on parameter-space heuristics, which often introduce severe interference, leading to degraded generalization and unstable generation behaviors such as repetition and incoherent outputs. In this work, we propose Sparse Complementary Fusion with reverse KL (SCF-RKL), a novel model merging framework that explicitly controls functional interference through sparse, distribution-aware updates. Instead of assuming linear additivity in parameter space, SCF-RKL measures the functional divergence between models using reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence and selectively incorporates complementary parameters. This mode-seeking, sparsity-inducing design effectively preserves stable representations while integrating new capabilities. We evaluate SCF-RKL across a wide range of model scales and architectures, covering both reasoning-focused and instruction-tuned models. Extensive experiments on 24 benchmarks spanning advanced reasoning, general reasoning and knowledge, instruction following, and safety demonstrate, vision classification that SCF-RKL consistently outperforms existing model merging methods while maintaining strong generalization and generation stability.", "AI": {"tldr": "SCF-RKL\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u878d\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7a00\u758f\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u66f4\u65b0\u6765\u663e\u5f0f\u63a7\u5236\u529f\u80fd\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u53cd\u5411KL\u6563\u5ea6\u6d4b\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u529f\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u878d\u5408\u4e92\u8865\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u8868\u793a\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6574\u5408\u65b0\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e38\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e25\u91cd\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u9020\u6210\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0b\u964d\u548c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u751f\u6210\u884c\u4e3a\uff08\u5982\u91cd\u590d\u548c\u4e0d\u8fde\u8d2f\u8f93\u51fa\uff09\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u663e\u5f0f\u63a7\u5236\u529f\u80fd\u5e72\u6270\u7684\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSCF-RKL\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u4f7f\u7528\u53cd\u5411Kullback-Leibler\u6563\u5ea6\u6d4b\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\uff1b2) \u9009\u62e9\u6027\u878d\u5408\u4e92\u8865\u53c2\u6570\uff1b3) \u91c7\u7528\u6a21\u5f0f\u5bfb\u6c42\u3001\u7a00\u758f\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u8868\u793a\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6574\u5408\u65b0\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u572824\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff08\u6db5\u76d6\u9ad8\u7ea7\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u901a\u7528\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u77e5\u8bc6\u3001\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u5206\u7c7b\uff09\u4e0a\uff0cSCF-RKL\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u751f\u6210\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "SCF-RKL\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u63a7\u5236\u529f\u80fd\u5e72\u6270\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u4e92\u8865\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u878d\u5408\u4e2d\u7684\u5e72\u6270\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u751f\u6210\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u878d\u5408\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

However, its application has so far been primarily focused on comparing a base model with its finetune. Since new LLM releases are often novel architectures, cross-architecture methods are essential to make model diffing widely applicable. Crosscoders are one solution capable of cross-architecture model diffing but have only ever been applied to base vs finetune comparisons.

Text-to-Graph-Query-Language (Text-to-GQL) systems act as a translator, converting natural language into executable graph queries. This capability allows Large Language Models (LLMs) to directly analyze and manipulate graph data, posi-tioning them as powerful agent infrastructures for Graph Database Management System (GDBMS). Despite recent progress, existing datasets are often limited in domain coverage, supported graph query languages, or evaluation scope. The advancement of Text-to-GQL systems is hindered by the lack of high-quality benchmark datasets and evaluation methods to systematically compare model capabilities across different graph query languages and domains. In this work, we present Text2GQL-Bench, a unified Text-to-GQL benchmark designed to address these limitations. Text2GQL-Bench couples a multi-GQL dataset that has 178,184 (Question, Query) pairs spanning 13 domains, with a scalable construction framework that generates datasets in different domains, question abstraction levels, and GQLs with heterogeneous resources. To support compre-hensive assessment, we introduce an evaluation method that goes beyond a single end-to-end metric by jointly reporting grammatical validity, similarity, semantic alignment, and execution accuracy. Our evaluation uncovers a stark dialect gap in ISO-GQL generation: even strong LLMs achieve only at most 4% execution accuracy (EX) in zero-shot settings, though a fixed 3-shot prompt raises accuracy to around 50%, the grammatical validity remains lower than 70%. Moreover, a fine-tuned 8B open-weight model reaches 45.1% EX, and 90.8% grammatical validity, demonstrating that most of the performance jump is unlocked by exposure to sufficient ISO-GQL examples.", "AI": {"tldr": "Text2GQL-Bench\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u67e5\u8be2\u8bed\u8a00\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b178,184\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898-\u67e5\u8be2\u5bf9\uff0c\u8986\u76d613\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86LLM\u5728ISO-GQL\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u663e\u8457\u65b9\u8a00\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u67e5\u8be2\u8bed\u8a00\u7cfb\u7edf\u9762\u4e34\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u9886\u57df\u8986\u76d6\u6709\u9650\u3001\u652f\u6301\u7684\u56fe\u67e5\u8be2\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0d\u8db3\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u8303\u56f4\u72ed\u7a84\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u56fe\u67e5\u8be2\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u9886\u57df\u4e0b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Text2GQL-Bench\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u591a\u56fe\u67e5\u8be2\u8bed\u8a00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6784\u5efa\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u4e0d\u540c\u9886\u57df\u3001\u95ee\u9898\u62bd\u8c61\u7ea7\u522b\u548c\u5f02\u6784\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u56fe\u67e5\u8be2\u8bed\u8a00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8bed\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3001\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u6267\u884c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u53d1\u73b0ISO-GQL\u751f\u6210\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u65b9\u8a00\u5dee\u8ddd\uff1a\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u5f3aLLM\u6700\u591a\u53ea\u80fd\u8fbe\u52304%\u7684\u6267\u884c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff1b\u56fa\u5b9a3\u6837\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u53ef\u5c06\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u63d0\u5347\u81f3\u7ea650%\uff0c\u4f46\u8bed\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4ecd\u4f4e\u4e8e70%\u3002\u5fae\u8c03\u76848B\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u8fbe\u523045.1%\u6267\u884c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c90.8%\u8bed\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6765\u81ea\u8db3\u591f\u7684ISO-GQL\u793a\u4f8b\u3002", "conclusion": "Text2GQL-Bench\u4e3a\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u67e5\u8be2\u8bed\u8a00\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524dLLM\u5728\u56fe\u67e5\u8be2\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662fISO-GQL\u7684\u65b9\u8a00\u5dee\u8ddd\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u53c2\u8003\u3002"}}

AIR defines a domain-specific language for managing the incident response lifecycle autonomously in LLM agent systems, and integrates it into the agent's execution loop to (1) detect incidents via semantic checks grounded in the current environment state and recent context, (2) guide the agent to execute containment and recovery actions via its tools, and (3) synthesize guardrail rules during eradication to block similar incidents in future executions. We evaluate AIR on three representative agent types. Results show that AIR achieves detection, remediation, and eradication success rates all exceeding 90%. Extensive experiments further confirm the necessity of AIR's key design components, show the timeliness and moderate overhead of AIR, and demonstrate that LLM-generated rules can approach the effectiveness of developer-authored rules across domains.

However, multi-turn RL remains challenging as rewards are often sparse or delayed, and environments can be stochastic. In this regime, naive trajectory sampling can hinder exploitation and induce mode collapse. We propose TSR (Trajectory-Search Rollouts), a training-time approach that repurposes test-time scaling ideas for improved per-turn rollout generation. TSR performs lightweight tree-style search to construct high-quality trajectories by selecting high-scoring actions at each turn using task-specific feedback. This improves rollout quality and stabilizes learning while leaving the underlying optimization objective unchanged, making TSR optimizer-agnostic. We instantiate TSR with best-of-N, beam, and shallow lookahead search, and pair it with PPO and GRPO, achieving up to 15% performance gains and more stable learning on Sokoban, FrozenLake, and WebShop tasks at a one-time increase in training compute.

Using three case studies spanning diverse taxa, species counts, and performance metrics, we show that MaxExp consistently matches or surpasses widely used thresholding and calibration methods, especially under strong class imbalance and high rarity.

To address this problem, we propose LAVES, a hierarchical LLM-based multi-agent system for generating high-quality instructional videos from educational problems. The LAVES formulates educational video generation as a multi-objective task that simultaneously demands correct step-by-step reasoning, pedagogically coherent narration, semantically faithful visual demonstrations, and precise audio--visual alignment. To address the limitations of prior approaches--including low procedural fidelity, high production cost, and limited controllability--LAVES decomposes the generation workflow into specialized agents coordinated by a central Orchestrating Agent with explicit quality gates and iterative critique mechanisms. Specifically, the Orchestrating Agent supervises a Solution Agent for rigorous problem solving, an Illustration Agent that produces executable visualization codes, and a Narration Agent for learner-oriented instructional scripts. In addition, all outputs from the working agents are subject to semantic critique, rule-based constraints, and tool-based compilation checks. Rather than directly synthesizing pixels, the system constructs a structured executable video script that is deterministically compiled into synchronized visuals and narration using template-driven assembly rules, enabling fully automated end-to-end production without manual editing. In large-scale deployments, LAVES achieves a throughput exceeding one million videos per day, delivering over a 95% reduction in cost compared to current industry-standard approaches while maintaining a high acceptance rate.", "AI": {"tldr": "LAVES\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u6559\u80b2\u95ee\u9898\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6559\u5b66\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u67b6\u6784\u5b9e\u73b0\u903b\u8f91\u4e25\u8c28\u3001\u77e5\u8bc6\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9700\u8981\u4e25\u683c\u903b\u8f91\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\u548c\u7cbe\u786e\u77e5\u8bc6\u8868\u793a\u7684\u573a\u666f\uff08\u5982\u6559\u5b66\u548c\u6559\u80b2\u5a92\u4f53\uff09\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u6559\u5b66\u89c6\u9891\u5bf9\u6b65\u9aa4\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u6559\u5b66\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u6f14\u793a\u548c\u97f3\u89c6\u9891\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u591a\u91cd\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42LLM\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7531\u7f16\u6392\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u8c03\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff08\u95ee\u9898\u6c42\u89e3\uff09\u3001\u63d2\u56fe\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff08\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\uff09\u548c\u53d9\u8ff0\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff08\u6559\u5b66\u811a\u672c\uff09\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8d28\u91cf\u95e8\u63a7\u3001\u8fed\u4ee3\u6279\u5224\u673a\u5236\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u68c0\u67e5\u3001\u89c4\u5219\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u7f16\u8bd1\u68c0\u67e5\u786e\u4fdd\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u89c6\u9891\u811a\u672c\u800c\u975e\u76f4\u63a5\u5408\u6210\u50cf\u7d20\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\uff0cLAVES\u6bcf\u5929\u53ef\u751f\u6210\u8d85\u8fc7100\u4e07\u4e2a\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u5f53\u524d\u884c\u4e1a\u6807\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e95%\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u63a5\u53d7\u7387\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5b8c\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u751f\u4ea7\u3002", "conclusion": "LAVES\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7f16\u8bd1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6559\u5b66\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\u3001\u77e5\u8bc6\u7cbe\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6210\u672c\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6559\u80b2\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u751f\u4ea7\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Unlike pretraining methods, which optimize models using token-level probabilities, RLVR fine-tunes models based on reward feedback from self-generated reasoning trajectories, making conventional likelihood-based detection methods less effective. We show that RLVR induces a distinctive behavioral signature: prompts encountered during RLVR training result in more rigid and similar generations, while unseen prompts retain greater diversity. We introduce Min-$k$NN Distance, a simple black-box detector that quantifies this collapse by sampling multiple completions for a given prompt and computing the average of the $k$ smallest nearest-neighbor edit distances. Min-$k$NN Distance requires no access to the reference model or token probabilities.

Semantic ID-based approaches effectively discretize this information into compact tokens. However, two challenges persist: (1) Suboptimal Tokenization: existing methods (e.g., RQ-VAE) lack disentanglement between shared cross-modal semantics and modality-specific details, causing redundancy or collapse; (2) Architecture-Data Mismatch: vanilla Transformers treat semantic IDs as flat streams, ignoring the hierarchy of user interactions, items, and tokens. Expanding items into multiple tokens amplifies length and noise, biasing attention toward local details over holistic semantics. We propose Hi-SAM, a Hierarchical Structure-Aware Multi-modal framework with two designs: (1) Disentangled Semantic Tokenizer (DST): unifies modalities via geometry-aware alignment and quantizes them via a coarse-to-fine strategy. Shared codebooks distill consensus while modality-specific ones recover nuances from residuals, enforced by mutual information minimization; (2) Hierarchical Memory-Anchor Transformer (HMAT): splits positional encoding into inter- and intra-item subspaces via Hierarchical RoPE to restore hierarchy. It inserts Anchor Tokens to condense items into compact memory, retaining details for the current item while accessing history only through compressed summaries.

To address these challenges, we propose a 3D Masked AutoEncoder (3D-MAE) that encodes weather-state evolution features as an additional conditioning for the diffusion model, together with a Variable-Aware Masked Frequency Modeling (VA-MFM) strategy that adaptively selects thresholds based on the spectral energy distribution of each variable. Together, we propose PuYun-LDM, which enhances latent diffusability and achieves superior performance to ENS at short lead times while remaining comparable to ENS at longer horizons. PuYun-LDM generates a 15-day global forecast with a 6-hour temporal resolution in five minutes on a single NVIDIA H200 GPU, while ensemble forecasts can be efficiently produced in parallel.", "AI": {"tldr": "PuYun-LDM\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u589e\u5f3a\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6c14\u8c61\u9884\u62a5\u4e2d\u6269\u6563\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc73D-MAE\u7f16\u7801\u5929\u6c14\u72b6\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u53d8\u91cf\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u63a9\u7801\u9891\u7387\u5efa\u6a21\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u96c6\u5408\u5929\u6c14\u9884\u62a5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6c14\u8c61\u9884\u62a5\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u6269\u6563\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u6c14\u8c61\u573a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4efb\u52a1\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u660e\u786e\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89c4\u8303\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u9891\u7387\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u5143\u6c14\u8c61\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u91c7\u7528\u540c\u8d28\u5316\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u53d8\u91cf\u95f4\u8c31\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u4e0b\u7684\u89c4\u8303\u5316\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5747\u5300\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPuYun-LDM\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u4f7f\u75283D\u63a9\u7801\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7f16\u7801\u5929\u6c14\u72b6\u6001\u6f14\u5316\u7279\u5f81\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u989d\u5916\u6761\u4ef6\uff1b2\uff09\u63d0\u51fa\u53d8\u91cf\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u63a9\u7801\u9891\u7387\u5efa\u6a21\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u6bcf\u4e2a\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u8c31\u80fd\u91cf\u5206\u5e03\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9009\u62e9\u9608\u503c\uff1b3\uff09\u7ed3\u5408\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6280\u672f\u589e\u5f3a\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "PuYun-LDM\u5728\u77ed\u9884\u62a5\u65f6\u6548\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8eENS\u96c6\u5408\u9884\u62a5\uff0c\u5728\u957f\u9884\u62a5\u65f6\u6548\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u53ef\u6bd4\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u80fd\u5728\u5355\u4e2aNVIDIA H200 GPU\u4e0a5\u5206\u949f\u5185\u751f\u621015\u5929\u5168\u7403\u9884\u62a5\uff086\u5c0f\u65f6\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u5e76\u884c\u751f\u6210\u96c6\u5408\u9884\u62a5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc73D-MAE\u7279\u5f81\u7f16\u7801\u548cVA-MFM\u7b56\u7565\uff0cPuYun-LDM\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6c14\u8c61\u9884\u62a5\u4e2d\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6269\u6563\u80fd\u529b\u9650\u5236\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u96c6\u5408\u5929\u6c14\u9884\u62a5\u3002"}}

We introduce a lightweight framework that reuses the main model's internal hidden states for efficient length prediction. Our framework features two core components: 1) Entropy-Guided Token Pooling (EGTP), which uses on-the-fly activations and token entropy for highly accurate static prediction with negligible cost, and 2) Progressive Length Prediction (PLP), which dynamically estimates the remaining length at each decoding step to handle stochastic generation. To validate our approach, we build and release ForeLen, a comprehensive benchmark with long-sequence, Chain-of-Thought, and RL data. On ForeLen, EGTP achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, reducing MAE by 29.16\\% over the best baseline.

Equal contribution: Yordan Yordanov and Matteo Forasassi. 39 pages, 25 figures, 22 tables", "summary": "While state-of-the-art language models (LMs) surpass the vast majority of humans in certain domains, their reasoning remains largely opaque, undermining trust in their output. Furthermore, while autoregressive LMs can output explicit reasoning, their true reasoning process is opaque, which introduces risks like deception and hallucination. In this work, we introduce the Prototype Transformer (ProtoT) -- an autoregressive LM architecture based on prototypes (parameter vectors), posed as an alternative to the standard self-attention-based transformers. ProtoT works by means of two-way communication between the input sequence and the prototypes, and we show that this leads to the prototypes automatically capturing nameable concepts (e.g. \"woman\") during training. They provide the potential to interpret the model's reasoning and allow for targeted edits of its behavior. Furthermore, by design, the prototypes create communication channels that aggregate contextual information at different time scales, aiding interpretability. In terms of computation scalability, ProtoT scales linearly with sequence length vs the quadratic scalability of SOTA self-attention transformers. Compared to baselines, ProtoT scales well with model and data size, and performs well on text generation and downstream tasks (GLUE). ProtoT exhibits robustness to input perturbations on par or better than some baselines, but differs from them by providing interpretable pathways showing how robustness and sensitivity arises.

These formulations provide representative solutions of the inverse problem and enable a systematic comparison of how different strategies influence the structure of the resulting weighted networks.

Under review", "summary": "Dynamic maps (DM) serve as the fundamental information infrastructure for vehicle-road-cloud (VRC) cooperative autonomous driving in China and Japan. By providing comprehensive traffic scene representations, DM overcome the limitations of standalone autonomous driving systems (ADS), such as physical occlusions. Although DM-enhanced ADS have been successfully deployed in real-world applications in Japan, existing DM systems still lack a natural-language-supported (NLS) human interface, which could substantially enhance human-DM interaction. To address this gap, this paper introduces VRCsim, a VRC cooperative perception (CP) simulation framework designed to generate streaming VRC-CP data. Based on VRCsim, we construct a question-answering data set, VRC-QA, focused on spatial querying and reasoning in mixed-traffic scenes. Building upon VRCsim and VRC-QA, we further propose Talk2DM, a plug-and-play module that extends VRC-DM systems with NLS querying and commonsense reasoning capabilities. Talk2DM is built upon a novel chain-of-prompt (CoP) mechanism that progressively integrates human-defined rules with the commonsense knowledge of large language models (LLMs). Experiments on VRC-QA show that Talk2DM can seamlessly switch across different LLMs while maintaining high NLS query accuracy, demonstrating strong generalization capability. Although larger models tend to achieve higher accuracy, they incur significant efficiency degradation. Our results reveal that Talk2DM, powered by Qwen3:8B, Gemma3:27B, and GPT-oss models, achieves over 93\\% NLS query accuracy with an average response time of only 2-5 seconds, indicating strong practical potential.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faVRCsim\u4eff\u771f\u6846\u67b6\u751f\u6210\u8f66\u8def\u4e91\u534f\u540c\u611f\u77e5\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6784\u5efaVRC-QA\u95ee\u7b54\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1Talk2DM\u6a21\u5757\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u5730\u56fe\u7cfb\u7edf\u589e\u52a0\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u67e5\u8be2\u548c\u5e38\u8bc6\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u52a8\u6001\u5730\u56fe\u7cfb\u7edf\u7f3a\u4e4f\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u652f\u6301\u7684\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u754c\u9762\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u5730\u56fe\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u6548\u7387\u3002\u867d\u7136DM\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u5df2\u5728\u65e5\u672c\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a5\u53e3\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6613\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "1. \u5f00\u53d1VRCsim\u8f66\u8def\u4e91\u534f\u540c\u611f\u77e5\u4eff\u771f\u6846\u67b6\u751f\u6210\u6d41\u5f0f\u6570\u636e\uff1b2. \u6784\u5efaVRC-QA\u95ee\u7b54\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u6df7\u5408\u4ea4\u901a\u573a\u666f\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u67e5\u8be2\u548c\u63a8\u7406\uff1b3. \u63d0\u51faTalk2DM\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u94fe\u5f0f\u63d0\u793a\u673a\u5236\u6574\u5408\u4eba\u5de5\u89c4\u5219\u548cLLM\u5e38\u8bc6\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "result": "Talk2DM\u5728\u4e0d\u540cLLM\u95f4\u65e0\u7f1d\u5207\u6362\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u67e5\u8be2\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff08\u8d85\u8fc793%\uff09\uff0c\u54cd\u5e94\u65f6\u95f4\u4ec52-5\u79d2\u3002\u867d\u7136\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\u4f46\u6548\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\uff0cQwen3:8B\u3001Gemma3:27B\u548cGPT-oss\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "Talk2DM\u6210\u529f\u4e3a\u8f66\u8def\u4e91\u52a8\u6001\u5730\u56fe\u7cfb\u7edf\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u67e5\u8be2\u548c\u5e38\u8bc6\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u94fe\u5f0f\u63d0\u793a\u673a\u5236\u6709\u6548\u6574\u5408\u89c4\u5219\u4e0e\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

To achieve more ambitious goals, AI agents need to be able to meaningfully decompose problems into manageable sub-components, and safely delegate their completion across to other AI agents and humans alike. Yet, existing task decomposition and delegation methods rely on simple heuristics, and are not able to dynamically adapt to environmental changes and robustly handle unexpected failures. Here we propose an adaptive framework for intelligent AI delegation - a sequence of decisions involving task allocation, that also incorporates transfer of authority, responsibility, accountability, clear specifications regarding roles and boundaries, clarity of intent, and mechanisms for establishing trust between the two (or more) parties.

To capture this, we propose the Hierarchical Sparse Autoencoder (HSAE), which jointly learns a series of SAEs and the parent-child relationships between their features. HSAE strengthens the alignment between parent and child features through two novel mechanisms: a structural constraint loss and a random feature perturbation mechanism. Extensive experiments across various LLMs and layers demonstrate that HSAE consistently recovers semantically meaningful hierarchies, supported by both qualitative case studies and rigorous quantitative metrics.

Selective Abstraction for Reliable Long-Form Text Generation", "comment": null, "summary": "LLMs are widely used, yet they remain prone to factual errors that erode user trust and limit adoption in high-risk settings. One approach to mitigate this risk is to equip models with uncertainty estimation mechanisms that abstain when confidence is low. However, this binary \"all-or-nothing\" approach is excessively restrictive in long-form settings, often discarding valuable information. We introduce Selective Abstraction (SA), a framework that enables LLMs to trade specificity for reliability by selectively reducing the detail of uncertain content. We first formalize SA through the lenses of selective risk and coverage. We then propose Atom-wise Selective Abstraction, a claim-level instantiation that decomposes responses into atomic claims (short, self-contained statements each expressing a single fact) and replaces uncertain atoms with higher confidence, less specific abstractions. To evaluate this framework, we develop a novel end-to-end pipeline for open-ended generation that instantiates risk as factual correctness and measures coverage using an information-theoretic measure of retained information. Across six open-source models on the FactScore and LongFact-Objects benchmarks, atom-wise SA consistently outperforms existing baselines, improving the area under the risk-coverage curve (AURC) by up to 27.73% over claim removal, demonstrating that reducing specificity can boost accuracy and reliability while preserving most of their original meaning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u62bd\u8c61(SA)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8ba9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u964d\u4f4e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u7ec6\u8282\u6765\u5e73\u8861\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4f20\u7edf\"\u5168\u6709\u6216\u5168\u65e0\"\u7684\u5f03\u6743\u673a\u5236\u8fc7\u4e8e\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u4e8b\u5b9e\u9519\u8bef\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u673a\u5236\u91c7\u7528\u4e8c\u5143\"\u5f03\u6743\"\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u5728\u957f\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u8fc7\u4e8e\u4e25\u683c\uff0c\u5e38\u5e38\u4e22\u5f03\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u62bd\u8c61(SA)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u54cd\u5e94\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u539f\u5b50\u58f0\u660e\uff0c\u7528\u66f4\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4f46\u66f4\u62bd\u8c61\u7684\u8868\u8ff0\u66ff\u6362\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u7684\u539f\u5b50\u58f0\u660e\u3002\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u65b9\u6cd5\u8861\u91cf\u4fdd\u7559\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u548cFactScore\u3001LongFact-Objects\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u539f\u5b50\u7ea7SA\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u98ce\u9669-\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u66f2\u7ebf\u4e0b\u9762\u79ef(AURC)\u6bd4\u58f0\u660e\u5220\u9664\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe27.73%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u964d\u4f4e\u7ec6\u8282\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u53ef\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u539f\u59cb\u542b\u4e49\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7ba1\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Existing automated methods primarily follow two paradigms: Decoupled Factor Generation, which treats factor discovery as isolated events, and Iterative Factor Evolution, which focuses on local parent-child refinements. However, both paradigms lack a global structural view, often treating factor pools as unstructured collections or fragmented chains, which leads to redundant search and limited diversity. To address these limitations, we introduce AlphaPROBE (Alpha Mining via Principled Retrieval and On-graph Biased Evolution), a framework that reframes alpha mining as the strategic navigation of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). By modeling factors as nodes and evolutionary links as edges, AlphaPROBE treats the factor pool as a dynamic, interconnected ecosystem. The framework consists of two core components: a Bayesian Factor Retriever that identifies high-potential seeds by balancing exploitation and exploration through a posterior probability model, and a DAG-aware Factor Generator that leverages the full ancestral trace of factors to produce context-aware, nonredundant optimizations. Extensive experiments on three major Chinese stock market datasets against 8 competitive baselines demonstrate that AlphaPROBE significantly gains enhanced performance in predictive accuracy, return stability and training efficiency.

However, current LLM-based methods primarily follow either an Asset-Centric paradigm focused on individual stock prediction or a Market-Centric approach for portfolio allocation, often remaining agnostic to the underlying reasoning that drives market movements. In this paper, we propose a Logic-Oriented perspective, modeling the financial market as a dynamic, evolutionary ecosystem of competing investment narratives, termed Modes of Thought. To operationalize this view, we introduce MEME (Modeling the Evolutionary Modes of Financial Markets), designed to reconstruct market dynamics through the lens of evolving logics. MEME employs a multi-agent extraction module to transform noisy data into high-fidelity Investment Arguments and utilizes Gaussian Mixture Modeling to uncover latent consensus within a semantic space. To model semantic drift among different market conditions, we also implement a temporal evaluation and alignment mechanism to track the lifecycle and historical profitability of these modes. By prioritizing enduring market wisdom over transient anomalies, MEME ensures that portfolio construction is guided by robust reasoning. Extensive experiments on three heterogeneous Chinese stock pools from 2023 to 2025 demonstrate that MEME consistently outperforms seven SOTA baselines. Further ablation studies, sensitivity analysis, lifecycle case study and cost analysis validate MEME's capacity to identify and adapt to the evolving consensus of financial markets.

Unlike prior static or synchronous evaluations, Gaia2 introduces scenarios where environments evolve independently of agent actions, requiring agents to operate under temporal constraints, adapt to noisy and dynamic events, resolve ambiguity, and collaborate with other agents. Each scenario is paired with a write-action verifier, enabling fine-grained, action-level evaluation and making Gaia2 directly usable for reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source models shows that no model dominates across capabilities: GPT-5 (high) reaches the strongest overall score of 42% pass@1 but fails on time-sensitive tasks, Claude-4 Sonnet trades accuracy and speed for cost, Kimi-K2 leads among open-source models with 21% pass@1. These results highlight fundamental trade-offs between reasoning, efficiency, robustness, and expose challenges in closing the \"sim2real\" gap.

In this study, we propose the Clinical Semantics Evaluator (CSEval), a framework that leverages language models to assess clinical semantic alignment between the generated images and their conditioning prompts. Our experiments show that CSEval identifies semantic inconsistencies overlooked by other metrics and correlates with expert judgment.

While recent studies have exploited behavior-related prompts adjustment to enhance reasoning, these designs remain largely intuitive and lack a systematic analysis of the underlying behavioral patterns. Motivated by this, we investigate how models' reasoning behaviors shape reasoning from the perspective of behavioral patterns. We observe that models exhibit adaptive distributions of reasoning behaviors when responding to specific types of questions, and that structurally injecting these patterns can substantially influence the quality of the models' reasoning processes and outcomes. Building on these findings, we propose two optimization methods that require no parameter updates: InjectCorrect and InjectRLOpt. InjectCorrect guides the model by imitating behavioral patterns derived from its own past correct answers. InjectRLOpt learns a value function from historical behavior-pattern data and, via our proposed Reliability-Aware Softmax Policy, generates behavioral injectant during inference to steer the reasoning process. Our experiments demonstrate that both methods can improve model performance across various reasoning tasks without requiring any modifications to model parameters, achieving gains of up to 5.34% and 8.67%, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u8eab\u63a8\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u63d0\u793a\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5927\u591a\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f4\u89c9\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5e95\u5c42\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u4ece\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\u89d2\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\u5982\u4f55\u5851\u9020\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1) InjectCorrect\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u4eff\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u8eab\u8fc7\u53bb\u6b63\u786e\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\u6765\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\uff1b2) InjectRLOpt\uff1a\u4ece\u5386\u53f2\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u4ef7\u503c\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u611f\u77e5Softmax\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u751f\u6210\u884c\u4e3a\u6ce8\u5165\u6765\u5f15\u5bfc\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u90fd\u80fd\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u83b7\u5f97\u6700\u9ad85.34%\u548c8.67%\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u8d28\u91cf\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u6ce8\u5165\u8fd9\u4e9b\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\u3002"}}

While Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) provides a formal framework, existing methods often lack the scalability and flexibility required for real-world Unmanned Traffic Management (UTM). We propose DTAPP-IICR: a Delivery-Time Aware Prioritized Planning method with Incremental and Iterative Conflict Resolution. Our framework first generates an initial solution by prioritizing missions based on urgency. Secondly, it computes roundtrip trajectories using SFIPP-ST, a novel 4D single-agent planner (Safe Flight Interval Path Planning with Soft and Temporal Constraints). SFIPP-ST handles heterogeneous UAVs, strictly enforces temporal NFZs, and models inter-agent conflicts as soft constraints. Subsequently, an iterative Large Neighborhood Search, guided by a geometric conflict graph, efficiently resolves any residual conflicts. A completeness-preserving directional pruning technique further accelerates the 3D search. On benchmarks with temporal NFZs, DTAPP-IICR achieves near-100% success with fleets of up to 1,000 UAVs and gains up to 50% runtime reduction from pruning, outperforming batch Enhanced Conflict-Based Search in the UTM context. Scaling successfully in realistic city-scale operations where other priority-based methods fail even at moderate deployments, DTAPP-IICR is positioned as a practical and scalable solution for preflight planning in dense, dynamic urban airspace.", "AI": {"tldr": "DTAPP-IICR\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u5411\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7fa4\u9884\u98de\u884c\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u89c4\u5212\u4e0e\u589e\u91cf\u8fed\u4ee3\u51b2\u7a81\u89e3\u51b3\uff0c\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u5171\u4eab\u7a7a\u57df\u4e2d\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u654f\u611f\u7981\u98de\u533a\u3001\u5f02\u6784\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u548c\u4e25\u683c\u4ea4\u4ed8\u671f\u9650\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8fbe1000\u67b6\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7684\u8fd1100%\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7fa4\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u5171\u4eab\u7a7a\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u9884\u98de\u884c\u89c4\u5212\u9762\u4e34\u91cd\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u65f6\u95f4\u654f\u611f\u7981\u98de\u533a\u3001\u5f02\u6784\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u914d\u7f6e\u548c\u4e25\u683c\u4ea4\u4ed8\u671f\u9650\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5b9e\u9645\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u901a\u7ba1\u7406\u6240\u9700\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDTAPP-IICR\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u4efb\u52a1\u7d27\u6025\u5ea6\u751f\u6210\u521d\u59cb\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u89c4\u5212\uff1b2\uff09\u4f7f\u7528SFIPP-ST\uff08\u5e26\u8f6f\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u98de\u884c\u95f4\u9694\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\uff09\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f80\u8fd4\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5904\u7406\u5f02\u6784\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u3001\u4e25\u683c\u65f6\u95f4\u7981\u98de\u533a\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u95f4\u51b2\u7a81\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u8f6f\u7ea6\u675f\uff1b3\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u51e0\u4f55\u51b2\u7a81\u56fe\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u5927\u90bb\u57df\u641c\u7d22\u89e3\u51b3\u5269\u4f59\u51b2\u7a81\uff1b4\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u4fdd\u6301\u5b8c\u5907\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u526a\u679d\u6280\u672f\u52a0\u901f3D\u641c\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u7981\u98de\u533a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cDTAPP-IICR\u5728\u9ad8\u8fbe1000\u67b6\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7684\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd1100%\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u526a\u679d\u6280\u672f\u5e26\u6765\u9ad8\u8fbe50%\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u6279\u5904\u7406\u589e\u5f3a\u51b2\u7a81\u641c\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5728\u57ce\u5e02\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u9645\u8fd0\u8425\u4e2d\u6210\u529f\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u800c\u5176\u4ed6\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e2d\u7b49\u89c4\u6a21\u90e8\u7f72\u4e0b\u5373\u5931\u8d25\u3002", "conclusion": "DTAPP-IICR\u4e3a\u5bc6\u96c6\u52a8\u6001\u57ce\u5e02\u7a7a\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u9884\u98de\u884c\u89c4\u5212\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u901a\u7ba1\u7406\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002"}}

However, existing methods lack mechanisms to verify intermediate reasoning steps, allowing errors such as inapplicable statute citations to propagate undetected through the reasoning chain. To address this, we propose LawThinker, an autonomous legal research agent that adopts an Explore-Verify-Memorize strategy for dynamic judicial environments. The core idea is to enforce verification as an atomic operation after every knowledge exploration step. A DeepVerifier module examines each retrieval result along three dimensions of knowledge accuracy, fact-law relevance, and procedural compliance, with a memory module for cross-round knowledge reuse in long-horizon tasks. Experiments on the dynamic benchmark J1-EVAL show that LawThinker achieves a 24% improvement over direct reasoning and an 11% gain over workflow-based methods, with particularly strong improvements on process-oriented metrics. Evaluations on three static benchmarks further confirm its generalization capability.

This raises a natural question about operator choice: Mamba-2's state space recurrence is itself a form of iterative refinement, making it a natural candidate for recursive reasoning -- but does introducing Mamba-2 into the recursive scaffold preserve reasoning capability? We investigate this by replacing the Transformer blocks in TRM with Mamba-2 hybrid operators while maintaining parameter parity (6.83M vs 6.86M parameters). On ARC-AGI-1, we find that the hybrid improves pass@2 (the official metric) by +2.0\\% (45.88\\% vs 43.88\\%) and consistently outperforms at higher K values (+4.75\\% at pass@100), whilst maintaining pass@1 parity. This suggests improved candidate coverage -- the model generates correct solutions more reliably -- with similar top-1 selection. Our results validate that Mamba-2 hybrid operators preserve reasoning capability within the recursive scaffold, establishing SSM-based operators as viable candidates in the recursive operator design space and taking a first step towards understanding the best mixing strategies for recursive reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7528Mamba-2\u6df7\u5408\u7b97\u5b50\u66ff\u6362TRM\u4e2d\u7684Transformer\u5757\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u53c2\u6570\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5728ARC-AGI-1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5019\u9009\u8986\u76d6\u65b9\u9762\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22Mamba-2\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u9012\u5f52\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8fed\u4ee3\u7cbe\u70bc\u5f62\u5f0f\u662f\u5426\u9002\u5408\u9012\u5f52\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1SSM-based\u7b97\u5b50\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u5c06TRM\u4e2d\u7684Transformer\u5757\u66ff\u6362\u4e3aMamba-2\u6df7\u5408\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u53c2\u6570\u76f8\u5f53\uff086.83M vs 6.86M\uff09\uff0c\u5728ARC-AGI-1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "Mamba-2\u6df7\u5408\u7b97\u5b50\u5c06pass@2\u63d0\u5347\u4e862.0%\uff0845.88% vs 43.88%\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u66f4\u9ad8K\u503c\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff08pass@100\u63d0\u53474.75%\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301pass@1\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5019\u9009\u8986\u76d6\u80fd\u529b\u589e\u5f3a\u3002", "conclusion": "Mamba-2\u6df7\u5408\u7b97\u5b50\u80fd\u5728\u9012\u5f52\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u786e\u7acb\u4e86SSM-based\u7b97\u5b50\u5728\u9012\u5f52\u7b97\u5b50\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u9012\u5f52\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u6df7\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u8fc8\u51fa\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b65\u3002"}}

However, traditional modal logic requires manual specification of relationship structures that are unknown or dynamic in real systems. This tutorial demonstrates differentiable modal logic (DML), implemented via Modal Logical Neural Networks (MLNNs), enabling systems to learn trust networks, causal chains, and regulatory boundaries from behavioral data alone.\n  We present a unified neurosymbolic debugging framework through four modalities: epistemic (who to trust), temporal (when events cause failures), deontic (what actions are permitted), and doxastic (how to interpret agent confidence). Each modality is demonstrated on concrete multi-agent scenarios, from discovering deceptive alliances in diplomacy games to detecting LLM hallucinations, with complete implementations showing how logical contradictions become learnable optimization objectives. Key contributions for the neurosymbolic community: (1) interpretable learned structures where trust and causality are explicit parameters, not opaque embeddings; (2) knowledge injection via differentiable axioms that guide learning with sparse data (3) compositional multi-modal reasoning that combines epistemic, temporal, and deontic constraints; and (4) practical deployment patterns for monitoring, active control and communication of multi-agent systems.

In the world of AI, while we possess the Pensieve-mature databases and retrieval systems, our models inexplicably lack the \"wand\" to operate it. They remain like a Dumbledore without agency, passively accepting a manually engineered context as their entire memory. This work finally places the wand in the model's hand. We introduce StateLM, a new class of foundation models endowed with an internal reasoning loop to manage their own state. We equip our model with a suite of memory tools, such as context pruning, document indexing, and note-taking, and train it to actively manage these tools. By learning to dynamically engineering its own context, our model breaks free from the architectural prison of a fixed window. Experiments across various model sizes demonstrate StateLM's effectiveness across diverse scenarios. On long-document QA tasks, StateLMs consistently outperform standard LLMs across all model scales; on the chat memory task, they achieve absolute accuracy improvements of 10% to 20% over standard LLMs. On the deep research task BrowseComp-Plus, the performance gap becomes even more pronounced: StateLM achieves up to 52% accuracy, whereas standard LLM counterparts struggle around 5%.

However, they often generate over-long chains-of-thought that, driven by substantial reflections such as repetitive self-questioning and circular reasoning, lead to high token consumption, substantial computational overhead, and increased latency without improving accuracy, particularly in smaller models. Our observation reveals that increasing problem complexity induces more excessive and unnecessary reflection, which in turn reduces accuracy and increases token overhead. To address this challenge, we propose Adaptive Reflection and Length Coordinated Penalty (ARLCP), a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to dynamically balance reasoning efficiency and solution accuracy. ARLCP introduces two key innovations: (1) a reflection penalty that adaptively curtails unnecessary reflective steps while preserving essential reasoning, and (2) a length penalty calibrated to the estimated complexity of the problem. By coordinating these penalties, ARLCP encourages the model to generate more concise and effective reasoning paths. We evaluate our method on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks using DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B models. Experimental results show that ARLCP achieves a superior efficiency-accuracy trade-off compared to existing approaches. For the 1.5B model, it reduces the average response length by 53.1% while simultaneously improving accuracy by 5.8%. For the 7B model, it achieves a 35.0% reduction in length with a 2.7% accuracy gain.

It relies on computing pairwise relations between tokens. To reduce the high computational cost of standard quadratic attention, linear attention has been proposed as an efficient approximation. It employs kernel functions that are applied independently to the inputs before the pairwise similarities are calculated. That allows for an efficient computational procedure which, however, amounts to a low-degree rational function approximating softmax.\n  We propose Hadamard Linear Attention (HLA). Unlike previous works on linear attention, the nonlinearity in HLA is not applied separately to queries and keys, but, analogously to standard softmax attention, after the pairwise similarities have been computed. It will be shown that the proposed nonlinearity amounts to a higher-degree rational function to approximate softmax. An efficient computational scheme for the proposed method is derived that is similar to that of standard linear attention. In contrast to other approaches, no time-consuming tensor reshaping is necessary to apply the proposed algorithm. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated by applying it to a large diffusion transformer model for video generation, an application that involves very large amounts of tokens.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faHadamard\u7ebf\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b(HLA)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u5bf9\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u540e\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u53d8\u6362\u6765\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u8fd1\u4f3csoftmax\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u7ebf\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4f7f\u7528\u66f4\u9ad8\u9636\u6709\u7406\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u7b49\u5927\u89c4\u6a21token\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7ebf\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u867d\u7136\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46\u4f7f\u7528\u4f4e\u9636\u6709\u7406\u51fd\u6570\u8fd1\u4f3csoftmax\uff0c\u4e14\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u53d8\u6362\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u524d\u72ec\u7acb\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u67e5\u8be2\u548c\u952e\uff0c\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6softmax\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u5f0f\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHadamard\u7ebf\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b(HLA)\uff0c\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u67e5\u8be2\u548c\u952e\u7684\u6210\u5bf9\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u540e\u624d\u5e94\u7528\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6softmax\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u66f4\u9ad8\u9636\u6709\u7406\u51fd\u6570\u8fd1\u4f3csoftmax\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u7c7b\u4f3c\u6807\u51c6\u7ebf\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8017\u65f6\u7684\u5f20\u91cf\u91cd\u5851\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "HLA\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6269\u6563\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u8be5\u5e94\u7528\u6d89\u53ca\u5927\u91cftoken\u5904\u7406\u3002\u65b9\u6cd5\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684softmax\u8fd1\u4f3c\u3002", "conclusion": "HLA\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u53d8\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u53d8\u6362\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u65f6\u673a\u548c\u4f7f\u7528\u66f4\u9ad8\u9636\u6709\u7406\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u7ebf\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5bf9softmax\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21token\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

Traditional compression techniques, such as dictionary-based and statistical methods, often struggle to optimally exploit the structure and redundancy in complex data formats. Recent advancements in deep learning have opened new avenues for compression; however, many existing approaches depend on dense vector representations that obscure the underlying token structure. To address these limitations, we propose a novel lossless compression method that leverages Reinforcement Learning applied to a T5 language model architecture. This approach enables the compression of data into sequences of tokens rather than traditional vector representations. Unlike auto-encoders, which typically encode information into continuous latent spaces, our method preserves the token-based structure, aligning more closely with the original data format. This preservation allows for higher compression ratios while maintaining semantic integrity. By training the model using an off-policy Reinforcement Learning algorithm, we optimize sequence length to minimize redundancy and enhance compression efficiency. Our method introduces an efficient and adaptive data compression system built upon advanced Reinforcement Learning techniques, functioning independently of external grammatical or world knowledge. This approach shows significant improvements in compression ratios compared to conventional methods. By leveraging the latent information within language models, our system effectively compresses data without requiring explicit content understanding, paving the way for more robust and practical compression solutions across various applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548cT5\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u65e0\u635f\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u6570\u636e\u538b\u7f29\u4e3atoken\u5e8f\u5217\u800c\u975e\u5411\u91cf\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u538b\u7f29\u6bd4\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u8bed\u4e49\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u590d\u6742\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5bc6\u96c6\u5411\u91cf\u8868\u793a\u800c\u63a9\u76d6\u4e86\u5e95\u5c42token\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65e0\u635f\u538b\u7f29\u6280\u672f\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3T5\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u5e8f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5c06\u6570\u636e\u538b\u7f29\u4e3atoken\u5e8f\u5217\u800c\u975e\u8fde\u7eed\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u538b\u7f29\u6bd4\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u8bed\u4e49\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u8bed\u6cd5\u6216\u4e16\u754c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u538b\u7f29\u6570\u636e\u800c\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u663e\u5f0f\u5185\u5bb9\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u5404\u79cd\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u6570\u636e\u538b\u7f29\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

Research into this question has focused on evaluating LLMs against benchmarks and found success across a range of social tasks. However, these evaluations do not test for the actual representations posited by ToM: namely, a causal model of mental states and behavior. Here, we use a cognitively-grounded definition of ToM to develop and test a new evaluation framework. Specifically, our approach probes whether LLMs have a coherent, domain-general, and consistent model of how mental states cause behavior -- regardless of whether that model matches a human-like ToM. We find that even though LLMs succeed in approximating human judgments in a simple ToM paradigm, they fail at a logically equivalent task and exhibit low consistency between their action predictions and corresponding mental state inferences. As such, these findings suggest that the social proficiency exhibited by LLMs is not the result of an domain-general or consistent ToM.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u7406\u8bba\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u80fd\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u903b\u8f91\u7b49\u4ef7\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u4e14\u884c\u4e3a\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5fc3\u7406\u72b6\u6001\u63a8\u65ad\u4e4b\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4f4e\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u793e\u4ea4\u80fd\u529b\u5e76\u975e\u6e90\u4e8e\u9886\u57df\u901a\u7528\u6216\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8bc4\u4f30LLMs\u662f\u5426\u5177\u5907\u5fc3\u7406\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e76\u672a\u68c0\u9a8c\u5fc3\u7406\u7406\u8bba\u6240\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u8868\u5f81\u2014\u2014\u5373\u5fc3\u7406\u72b6\u6001\u4e0e\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ba4\u77e5\u79d1\u5b66\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63a2\u7a76LLMs\u662f\u5426\u62e5\u6709\u8fde\u8d2f\u3001\u9886\u57df\u901a\u7528\u4e14\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u72b6\u6001\u5bfc\u81f4\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ba4\u77e5\u79d1\u5b66\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u7406\u8bba\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6d4b\u8bd5LLMs\u662f\u5426\u62e5\u6709\u8fde\u8d2f\u3001\u9886\u57df\u901a\u7528\u4e14\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u72b6\u6001\u5bfc\u81f4\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5fc3\u7406\u7406\u8bba\u5339\u914d\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\u8ba9LLMs\u5b8c\u6210\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u7406\u8bba\u8303\u5f0f\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u7b49\u4ef7\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83\u5176\u884c\u4e3a\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5fc3\u7406\u72b6\u6001\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a1) LLMs\u5728\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u7406\u8bba\u8303\u5f0f\u4e2d\u80fd\u6210\u529f\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\uff1b2) \u4f46\u5728\u903b\u8f91\u7b49\u4ef7\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5931\u8d25\uff1b3) \u5176\u884c\u4e3a\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u72b6\u6001\u63a8\u65ad\u4e4b\u95f4\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f4e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMs\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7684\u793e\u4ea4\u719f\u7ec3\u5ea6\u5e76\u975e\u6e90\u4e8e\u9886\u57df\u901a\u7528\u6216\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u7406\u8bba\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u80fd\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u72b6\u6001\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u5f53\u524dLLMs\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u7406\u8bba\u80fd\u529b\u662f\u8868\u9762\u6027\u7684\u800c\u975e\u5b9e\u8d28\u6027\u7684\u3002"}}

In the first stage, the model uses a small set of annotated data to establish fundamental correctness judgment anchors for the Verifier. In the second stage, we introduce a geometric reward mechanism that jointly considers consensus, reliability, and diversity, driving large-scale self-iteration on unlabeled data.

That work left two gaps: no negation/backward reasoning, and no parser for natural language.\n  This paper addresses both gaps across inference, semantics, and syntax. For inference, we extend the QBBN with NEG factors enforcing P(x) + P(neg x) = 1, enabling contrapositive reasoning (modus tollens) via backward lambda messages, completing Prawitz's simple elimination rules. The engine handles 44/44 test cases spanning 22 reasoning patterns. For semantics, we present a typed logical language with role-labeled predicates, modal quantifiers, and three tiers of expressiveness following Prawitz: first-order quantification, propositions as arguments, and predicate quantification via lambda abstraction. For syntax, we present a typed slot grammar that deterministically compiles sentences to logical form (33/33 correct, zero ambiguity). LLMs handle disambiguation (95% PP attachment accuracy) but cannot produce structured parses directly (12.4% UAS), confirming grammars are necessary. The architecture: LLM preprocesses, grammar parses, LLM reranks, QBBN infers.\n  We argue this reconciles formal semantics with Sutton's \"bitter lesson\" (2019): LLMs eliminate the annotation bottleneck that killed formal NLP, serving as annotator while the QBBN serves as verifier.

However, current methods for distillation via synthetic data lack pedagogical awareness, treating knowledge transfer as a one-off data synthesis and training task rather than a systematic learning process. In this paper, we propose a novel pedagogically-inspired framework for LLM knowledge distillation that draws from fundamental educational principles. Our approach introduces a three-stage pipeline -- Knowledge Identifier, Organizer, and Adapter (IOA) -- that systematically identifies knowledge deficiencies in student models, organizes knowledge delivery through progressive curricula, and adapts representations to match the cognitive capacity of student models. We integrate Bloom's Mastery Learning Principles and Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development to create a dynamic distillation process where student models approach teacher model's performance on prerequisite knowledge before advancing, and new knowledge is introduced with controlled, gradual difficulty increments. Extensive experiments using LLaMA-3.1/3.2 and Qwen2.5 as student models demonstrate that IOA achieves significant improvements over baseline distillation methods, with student models retaining 94.7% of teacher performance on DollyEval while using less than 1/10th of the parameters.

In practice, segmentation prompts are short, structured, and semantically constrained, leading to substantial over-provisioning in text encoder capacity and persistent computational and memory overhead. In this paper, we perform a large-scale anatomical analysis of text prompting in vision-language segmentation, covering 404,796 real prompts across multiple benchmarks. Our analysis reveals severe redundancy: most context windows are underutilized, vocabulary usage is highly sparse, and text embeddings lie on low-dimensional manifold despite high-dimensional representations. Motivated by these findings, we propose SAM3-LiteText, a lightweight text encoding framework that replaces the original SAM3 text encoder with a compact MobileCLIP student that is optimized by knowledge distillation. Extensive experiments on image and video segmentation benchmarks show that SAM3-LiteText reduces text encoder parameters by up to 88%, substantially reducing static memory footprint, while maintaining segmentation performance comparable to the original model.

However, applying reinforcement learning to such settings remains difficult: realistic objectives often lack verifiable rewards and instead emphasize open-ended behaviors; moreover, RL for multi-turn, multi-step agentic tool use is still underexplored; and building and maintaining executable tool environments is costly, limiting scale and coverage. We propose CM2, an RL framework that replaces verifiable outcome rewards with checklist rewards. CM2 decomposes each turn's intended behavior into fine-grained binary criteria with explicit evidence grounding and structured metadata, turning open-ended judging into more stable classification-style decisions. To balance stability and informativeness, our method adopts a strategy of sparse reward assignment but dense evaluation criteria. Training is performed in a scalable LLM-simulated tool environment, avoiding heavy engineering for large tool sets. Experiments show that CM2 consistently improves over supervised fine-tuning. Starting from an 8B Base model and training on an 8k-example RL dataset, CM2 improves over the SFT counterpart by 8 points on tau^-Bench, by 10 points on BFCL-V4, and by 12 points on ToolSandbox. The results match or even outperform similarly sized open-source baselines, including the judging model. CM2 thus provides a scalable recipe for optimizing multi-turn, multi-step tool-using agents without relying on verifiable rewards.

However, its behavior on agentic, multi-step tasks remains less well-understood: small per-step errors can compound over long horizons; and we find that naive policies that uniformly increase sampling show diminishing returns. In this work, we present CATTS, a simple technique for dynamically allocating compute for multi-step agents. We first conduct an empirical study of inference-time scaling for web agents. We find that uniformly increasing per-step compute quickly saturates in long-horizon environments. We then investigate stronger aggregation strategies, including an LLM-based Arbiter that can outperform naive voting, but that can overrule high-consensus decisions. We show that uncertainty statistics derived from the agent's own vote distribution (entropy and top-1/top-2 margin) correlate with downstream success and provide a practical signal for dynamic compute allocation. Based on these findings, we introduce Confidence-Aware Test-Time Scaling (CATTS), which uses vote-derived uncertainty to allocate compute only when decisions are genuinely contentious.

We also provide a python pipeline, which can be used to process the next releases of the OpenAIRE graph.", "AI": {"tldr": "OpenAIRE\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5f15\u7528\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff082\u4ebf\u6587\u732e+20\u4ebf\u5f15\u7528\uff09\u88ab\u538b\u7f29\u5904\u7406\u4e3a32GB\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u5b8c\u6574\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u7b80\u5355\u683c\u5f0f\u548cPython\u5904\u7406\u7ba1\u9053", "motivation": "OpenAIRE\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u89c4\u6a21\u5e9e\u5927\uff08\u7ea6TB\u7ea7\uff09\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u5e38\u89c4\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u4e0a\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4f7f\u5176\u66f4\u6613\u4e8e\u793e\u533a\u8bbf\u95ee\u548c\u4f7f\u7528", "method": "\u5bf9\u539f\u59cb\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u964d\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u538b\u7f29\u81f332GB\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u5b8c\u6574\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b\u63d0\u4f9b\u7b80\u5355\u6570\u636e\u683c\u5f0f\u548cPython\u5904\u7406\u7ba1\u9053", "result": "\u751f\u621032GB\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u7248OpenAIRE\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u5b8c\u6574\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u6613\u4e8e\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u6570\u636e\u683c\u5f0f\u548c\u53ef\u590d\u7528\u7684\u5904\u7406\u5de5\u5177", "conclusion": "\u6210\u529f\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86OpenAIRE\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5f15\u7528\u56fe\u7684\u5904\u7406\u95e8\u69db\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u66f4\u6613\u4e8e\u793e\u533a\u8bbf\u95ee\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6848"}}
