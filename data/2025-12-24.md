TL;DR: PhysMaster是一个基于LLM的自主理论物理学家代理，通过结合抽象推理与数值计算，利用LANDAU知识库和自适应探索策略，在物理研究中实现加速、自动化和自主发现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM代理主要在定义良好的基准测试或文献检索等通用任务上评估，缺乏在开放科学场景中的端到端问题解决能力。物理学尤其具有抽象性、数学密集性，需要整合分析推理与代码计算，因此需要开发能够自主进行物理研究的智能代理。

Method: PhysMaster将抽象推理与数值计算相结合，利用LANDAU（分层学术数据宇宙）知识库保存检索文献、整理先验知识和验证方法轨迹，增强决策可靠性和稳定性。采用自适应探索策略平衡效率与开放式探索，支持超长视野任务。

Result: 在高能理论、凝聚态理论和天体物理等多个物理领域问题上评估显示：(1) 加速：将劳动密集型研究从数月压缩到数小时；(2) 自动化：自主执行假设驱动循环；(3) 自主发现：独立探索开放问题。

Conclusion: PhysMaster作为自主理论物理学家代理，通过整合推理、计算和知识管理，在物理研究中实现了显著的加速、自动化和自主发现能力，为科学研究的自动化提供了新范式。

Abstract: Advances in LLMs have produced agents with knowledge and operational capabilities comparable to human scientists, suggesting potential to assist, accelerate, and automate research. However, existing studies mainly evaluate such systems on well-defined benchmarks or general tasks like literature retrieval, limiting their end-to-end problem-solving ability in open scientific scenarios. This is particularly true in physics, which is abstract, mathematically intensive, and requires integrating analytical reasoning with code-based computation. To address this, we propose PhysMaster, an LLM-based agent functioning as an autonomous theoretical and computational physicist. PhysMaster couples absract reasoning with numerical computation and leverages LANDAU, the Layered Academic Data Universe, which preserves retrieved literature, curated prior knowledge, and validated methodological traces, enhancing decision reliability and stability. It also employs an adaptive exploration strategy balancing efficiency and open-ended exploration, enabling robust performance in ultra-long-horizon tasks. We evaluate PhysMaster on problems from high-energy theory, condensed matter theory to astrophysics, including: (i) acceleration, compressing labor-intensive research from months to hours; (ii) automation, autonomously executing hypothesis-driven loops ; and (iii) autonomous discovery, independently exploring open problems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种双目标优化方法，用于灾后救援物资分配，同时考虑效率（最小化总旅行时间）和公平性（最小化未满足需求的基尼系数），并开发了分支定价算法进行高效求解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重大灾害中，预置的救援物资通常无法满足所有需求，需要在多个避难所之间合理分配有限物资。传统方法往往只关注效率，忽略了分配的公平性，可能导致某些避难所获得过多援助而其他避难所严重短缺。

Method: 1. 建立双目标混合整数规划模型：目标一是最小化未满足需求的基尼系数（公平性），目标二是最小化总旅行时间（效率）；2. 使用ε-约束方法处理双目标优化；3. 推导最优解的数学性质，引入有效不等式；4. 设计给定可行车辆路径下的最优配送分配算法；5. 开发分支定价算法进行高效求解。

Result: 1. 分支定价算法在土耳其凡城地震和伊斯坦布尔卡尔塔尔地区的实际数据集上显著优于商业MIP求解器；2. 双目标方法在不牺牲效率的情况下将援助分配不公平性降低了34%；3. 时间约束非常宽松或紧张时，优先考虑需求覆盖的词典优化有效；4. 时间约束中等严格时，平衡方法对避免不公平结果至关重要。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的双目标优化框架和分支定价算法能够有效平衡灾后救援物资分配的效率和公平性。研究结果表明，在不同时间约束条件下需要采用不同的优化策略：极端情况下优先满足需求，中等约束时需要平衡考虑，以实现更公平的救援物资分配。

Abstract: The distribution of relief supplies to shelters is a critical aspect of post-disaster humanitarian logistics. In major disasters, prepositioned supplies often fall short of meeting all demands. We address the problem of planning vehicle routes from a distribution center to shelters while allocating limited relief supplies. To balance efficiency and equity, we formulate a bi-objective problem: minimizing a Gini-index-based measure of inequity in unsatisfied demand for fair distribution and minimizing total travel time for timely delivery. We propose a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model and use the $ε$-constraint method to handle the bi-objective nature. By deriving mathematical properties of the optimal solution, we introduce valid inequalities and design an algorithm for optimal delivery allocations given feasible vehicle routes. A branch-and-price (B&P) algorithm is developed to solve the problem efficiently. Computational tests on realistic datasets from a past earthquake in Van, Turkey, and predicted data for Istanbul's Kartal region show that the B&P algorithm significantly outperforms commercial MIP solvers. Our bi-objective approach reduces aid distribution inequity by 34% without compromising efficiency. Results indicate that when time constraints are very loose or tight, lexicographic optimization prioritizing demand coverage over fairness is effective. For moderately restrictive time constraints, a balanced approach is essential to avoid inequitable outcomes.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 使用插值解码方法让大语言模型模拟人类人格特质，在经济学游戏中复现人类决策行为


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型可以作为人类代理进行行为模拟，但为每个人格特征创建提示会增加实验负担并降低可重复性。需要一种更高效的方法来模拟不同人格特质对决策的影响。

Method: 采用插值解码技术，将每个人格维度表示为一对相反的提示，通过插值参数在维度上模拟行为。使用大五人格模型作为框架，通过系统搜索插值空间来匹配人类玩家的行为。

Result: 插值解码能够可靠地调节大五人格各维度的得分，使大语言模型在经济学游戏中复现人类决策行为，成功匹配人类心理学研究结果。初步实现了在协作游戏中通过插值空间搜索来"复制"个体人类玩家的行为。

Conclusion: 插值解码提供了一种高效、可重复的方法来模拟人格特质对决策的影响，使大语言模型能够更准确地模拟人类行为，为行为经济学和心理学研究提供了新的工具。

Abstract: Recent research has explored using very large language models (LLMs) as proxies for humans in tasks such as simulation, surveys, and studies. While LLMs do not possess a human psychology, they often can emulate human behaviors with sufficiently high fidelity to drive simulations to test human behavioral hypotheses, exhibiting more nuance and range than the rule-based agents often employed in behavioral economics. One key area of interest is the effect of personality on decision making, but the requirement that a prompt must be created for every tested personality profile introduces experimental overhead and degrades replicability. To address this issue, we leverage interpolative decoding, representing each dimension of personality as a pair of opposed prompts and employing an interpolation parameter to simulate behavior along the dimension. We show that interpolative decoding reliably modulates scores along each of the Big Five dimensions. We then show how interpolative decoding causes LLMs to mimic human decision-making behavior in economic games, replicating results from human psychological research. Finally, we present preliminary results of our efforts to ``twin'' individual human players in a collaborative game through systematic search for points in interpolation space that cause the system to replicate actions taken by the human subject.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一种基于类别原型引导的视觉Transformer分割方法，用于PlantCLEF 2025挑战赛中的细粒度多标签物种识别，在私有排行榜上获得第五名。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决PlantCLEF 2025挑战赛中高分辨率图像上的细粒度多标签物种识别问题，通过训练集类别原型引导测试集图像分割，实现从单物种多类别识别到植被地块多标签分类的领域适应。

Method: 使用K-Means聚类从训练集图像特征中提取类别原型，构建定制化的窄视觉Transformer，用冻结的DinoV2预训练模型替换patch嵌入层，训练模型从测试集图像重建训练集类别原型，利用注意力分数识别感兴趣区域并指导分类。

Result: 在PlantCLEF 2025挑战赛私有排行榜上获得第五名，F1分数为0.33331，与最佳提交结果仅相差0.03，表现出竞争性性能。

Conclusion: 基于类别原型引导的视觉Transformer分割方法在细粒度多标签物种识别任务中有效，实现了从单物种分类到植被地块多标签分类的领域适应，具有竞争性性能。

Abstract: This paper presents an approach developed to address the PlantClef 2025 challenge, which consists of a fine-grained multi-label species identification, over high-resolution images. Our solution focused on employing class prototypes obtained from the training dataset as a proxy guidance for training a segmentation Vision Transformer (ViT) on the test set images. To obtain these representations, the proposed method extracts features from training dataset images and create clusters, by applying K-Means, with $K$ equals to the number of classes in the dataset. The segmentation model is a customized narrow ViT, built by replacing the patch embedding layer with a frozen DinoV2, pre-trained on the training dataset for individual species classification. This model is trained to reconstruct the class prototypes of the training dataset from the test dataset images. We then use this model to obtain attention scores that enable to identify and localize areas of interest and consequently guide the classification process. The proposed approach enabled a domain-adaptation from multi-class identification with individual species, into multi-label classification from high-resolution vegetation plots. Our method achieved fifth place in the PlantCLEF 2025 challenge on the private leaderboard, with an F1 score of 0.33331. Besides that, in absolute terms our method scored 0.03 lower than the top-performing submission, suggesting that it may achieved competitive performance in the benchmark task.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一种通过类内聚类学习细粒度特征的新方法，用于缓解细粒度视觉分类中的类内变异问题，在PlantNet300k数据集上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 细粒度视觉分类任务中，类内变异（同一类别内图像的差异程度）会阻碍深度学习模型的学习过程，特别是当这些类别样本不足时。需要解决类内变异对分类性能的负面影响。

Method: 提出一种新颖方法：对每个类别单独进行聚类，发现编码图像间相似度的伪标签，然后通过分层分类过程利用这些标签学习更细粒度的视觉特征，从而缓解类内变异问题。

Result: 在PlantNet300k数据集上进行了初步实验，揭示了未来工作需要发展的关键点。尽管部分组件尚未完全优化，但该方法在PlantNet300k数据集上仍达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 通过类内聚类学习细粒度特征的方法能够有效缓解细粒度视觉分类中的类内变异问题，在PlantNet300k数据集上表现出色，为未来研究提供了有价值的思路。

Abstract: Intra-class variability is given according to the significance in the degree of dissimilarity between images within a class. In that sense, depending on its intensity, intra-class variability can hinder the learning process for DL models, specially when such classes are also underrepresented, which is a very common scenario in Fine-Grained Visual Categorization (FGVC) tasks. This paper proposes a novel method that aims at leveraging classification performance in FGVC tasks by learning fine-grained features via classification of class-wise cluster assignments. Our goal is to apply clustering over each class individually, which can allow to discover pseudo-labels that encodes a latent degree of similarity between images. In turn, those labels can be employed in a hierarchical classification process that allows to learn more fine-grained visual features and thereby mitigating intra-class variability issues. Initial experiments over the PlantNet300k enabled to shed light upon several key points in which future work will have to be developed in order to find more conclusive evidence regarding the effectiveness of our method. Our method still achieves state-of-the-art performance on the PlantNet300k dataset even though some of its components haven't been shown to be fully optimized.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: S³IT：一个评估具身社交智能的基准测试，通过3D环境中的座位安排任务，要求智能体综合考虑社交关系和物理约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法要么只关注非具身的社交推理（如文本），要么只关注无社交意识的物理任务，无法评估智能体在真实具身环境中整合物理和社交约束的能力。

Method: 提出S³IT基准，核心是新颖的座位安排任务：智能体需要在3D环境中为一组具有不同身份、偏好和复杂人际关系的LLM驱动的NPC安排座位。使用程序化可扩展框架生成大量多样化场景，智能体需要通过主动对话获取偏好、自主探索感知环境，并在复杂约束网络中进行多目标优化。

Result: 评估当前最先进的LLM在S³IT上的表现，发现它们仍然难以解决此问题，与人类基线存在明显差距。结果表明LLM在空间智能方面存在不足，但在处理具有明确文本线索的冲突时能达到接近人类的水平。

Conclusion: S³IT基准填补了具身社交智能评估的空白，揭示了当前LLM在整合物理和社交约束方面的局限性，为未来具身智能研究提供了重要方向。

Abstract: The integration of embodied agents into human environments demands embodied social intelligence: reasoning over both social norms and physical constraints. However, existing evaluations fail to address this integration, as they are limited to either disembodied social reasoning (e.g., in text) or socially-agnostic physical tasks. Both approaches fail to assess an agent's ability to integrate and trade off both physical and social constraints within a realistic, embodied context. To address this challenge, we introduce Spatially Situated Social Intelligence Test (S$^{3}$IT), a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate embodied social intelligence. It is centered on a novel and challenging seat-ordering task, requiring an agent to arrange seating in a 3D environment for a group of large language model-driven (LLM-driven) NPCs with diverse identities, preferences, and intricate interpersonal relationships. Our procedurally extensible framework generates a vast and diverse scenario space with controllable difficulty, compelling the agent to acquire preferences through active dialogue, perceive the environment via autonomous exploration, and perform multi-objective optimization within a complex constraint network. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on S$^{3}$IT and found that they still struggle with this problem, showing an obvious gap compared with the human baseline. Results imply that LLMs have deficiencies in spatial intelligence, yet simultaneously demonstrate their ability to achieve near human-level competence in resolving conflicts that possess explicit textual cues.

TL;DR: 提出LieFlow方法，通过流匹配在李群上直接从数据中学习对称性，无需先验知识，能够发现离散群和反射等对称性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对称性对理解物理系统和提高机器学习性能都很重要，但通常需要先验知识。本文旨在直接从数据中发现对称性，无需假设。

Method: 提出LieFlow方法，将对称性发现建模为在更大的假设群上学习分布，通过流匹配在李群上匹配数据中观察到的对称性。引入新的插值方案解决"最后一刻收敛"问题。

Result: 在2D和3D点云数据上成功发现了离散群，包括通过复域流匹配发现的反射对称性。解决了目标模式对称排列导致的"最后一刻收敛"挑战。

Conclusion: LieFlow能够直接从数据中发现对称性，比先前方法更灵活、假设更少，为对称性发现提供了新的流匹配框架。

Abstract: Symmetry is fundamental to understanding physical systems, and at the same time, can improve performance and sample efficiency in machine learning. Both pursuits require knowledge of the underlying symmetries in data. To address this, we propose learning symmetries directly from data via flow matching on Lie groups. We formulate symmetry discovery as learning a distribution over a larger hypothesis group, such that the learned distribution matches the symmetries observed in data. Relative to previous works, our method, \lieflow, is more flexible in terms of the types of groups it can discover and requires fewer assumptions. Experiments on 2D and 3D point clouds demonstrate the successful discovery of discrete groups, including reflections by flow matching over the complex domain. We identify a key challenge where the symmetric arrangement of the target modes causes ``last-minute convergence,'' where samples remain stationary until relatively late in the flow, and introduce a novel interpolation scheme for flow matching for symmetry discovery.

Motivation: 现有视频生成模型难以转化为低级动作，而潜在动作模型缺乏高层规划能力，需要弥合视频学习与机器人动作执行之间的鸿沟

Method: 提出SOF框架，通过光流中间表示学习潜在技能空间，该空间同时捕获视频动态和机器人动作信息，实现基于视频技能的高层规划

Result: 实验表明SOF在多任务和长时域设置中持续提升性能，能够直接从原始视觉数据中获取和组合技能

Conclusion: SOF通过光流中间表示有效连接视频学习与机器人动作执行，为从视频中学习通用机器人技能提供了有前景的路径

Abstract: Learning from videos offers a promising path toward generalist robots by providing rich visual and temporal priors beyond what real robot datasets contain. While existing video generative models produce impressive visual predictions, they are difficult to translate into low-level actions. Conversely, latent-action models better align videos with actions, but they typically operate at the single-step level and lack high-level planning capabilities. We bridge this gap by introducing Skill Abstraction from Optical Flow (SOF), a framework that learns latent skills from large collections of action-free videos. Our key idea is to learn a latent skill space through an intermediate representation based on optical flow that captures motion information aligned with both video dynamics and robot actions. By learning skills in this flow-based latent space, SOF enables high-level planning over video-derived skills and allows for easier translation of these skills into actions. Experiments show that our approach consistently improves performance in both multitask and long-horizon settings, demonstrating the ability to acquire and compose skills directly from raw visual data.

Abstract: As Earth's climate changes, it is impacting disasters and extreme weather events across the planet. Record-breaking heat waves, drenching rainfalls, extreme wildfires, and widespread flooding during hurricanes are all becoming more frequent and more intense. Rapid and efficient response to disaster events is essential for climate resilience and sustainability. A key challenge in disaster response is to accurately and quickly identify disaster locations to support decision-making and resources allocation. In this paper, we propose a Probabilistic Cross-view Geolocalization approach, called ProbGLC, exploring new pathways towards generative location awareness for rapid disaster response. Herein, we combine probabilistic and deterministic geolocalization models into a unified framework to simultaneously enhance model explainability (via uncertainty quantification) and achieve state-of-the-art geolocalization performance. Designed for rapid diaster response, the ProbGLC is able to address cross-view geolocalization across multiple disaster events as well as to offer unique features of probabilistic distribution and localizability score. To evaluate the ProbGLC, we conduct extensive experiments on two cross-view disaster datasets (i.e., MultiIAN and SAGAINDisaster), consisting diverse cross-view imagery pairs of multiple disaster types (e.g., hurricanes, wildfires, floods, to tornadoes). Preliminary results confirms the superior geolocalization accuracy (i.e., 0.86 in Acc@1km and 0.97 in Acc@25km) and model explainability (i.e., via probabilistic distributions and localizability scores) of the proposed ProbGLC approach, highlighting the great potential of leveraging generative cross-view approach to facilitate location awareness for better and faster disaster response.

TL;DR: 本文通过强化学习训练语言模型进行内容审核，在真实任务中验证了RL的sigmoid式扩展行为，相比监督微调实现了100倍数据效率提升，特别适用于标注稀缺的复杂政策推理场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模内容审核是数字生态系统的紧迫挑战，现有LLM在政策导向审核方面有潜力，但在真实场景中实现专家级准确性的实际挑战（标签稀疏、政策演变、需要超越浅层模式匹配的细致推理）尚未充分探索。

Method: 采用强化学习训练语言模型进行内容分类，系统评估多种RL训练方案和奖励塑造策略，包括可验证奖励和LLM作为裁判框架，将通用语言模型转化为专门的政策对齐分类器，在三个真实内容审核任务中进行验证。

Result: RL表现出sigmoid式扩展行为，性能随训练数据、rollouts和优化步骤增加而平滑提升后逐渐饱和；RL在需要复杂政策推理的任务上显著提升性能，相比监督微调实现高达100倍的数据效率提升，在专家标注稀缺或昂贵的领域特别有效。

Conclusion: 强化学习为工业级内容审核系统提供了可行方案，在数据稀缺和政策推理复杂的场景中具有显著优势，为实际部署提供了可操作的见解。

Abstract: Content moderation at scale remains one of the most pressing challenges in today's digital ecosystem, where billions of user- and AI-generated artifacts must be continuously evaluated for policy violations. Although recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong potential for policy-grounded moderation, the practical challenges of training these systems to achieve expert-level accuracy in real-world settings remain largely unexplored, particularly in regimes characterized by label sparsity, evolving policy definitions, and the need for nuanced reasoning beyond shallow pattern matching. In this work, we present a comprehensive empirical investigation of scaling reinforcement learning (RL) for content classification, systematically evaluating multiple RL training recipes and reward-shaping strategies-including verifiable rewards and LLM-as-judge frameworks-to transform general-purpose language models into specialized, policy-aligned classifiers across three real-world content moderation tasks. Our findings provide actionable insights for industrial-scale moderation systems, demonstrating that RL exhibits sigmoid-like scaling behavior in which performance improves smoothly with increased training data, rollouts, and optimization steps before gradually saturating. Moreover, we show that RL substantially improves performance on tasks requiring complex policy-grounded reasoning while achieving up to 100x higher data efficiency than supervised fine-tuning, making it particularly effective in domains where expert annotations are scarce or costly.

TL;DR: Reason2Decide是一个两阶段训练框架，用于解决临床决策支持系统中预测准确性与解释对齐的问题，通过分阶段训练减少暴露偏差，在小型模型上实现高性能的预测和解释生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前临床决策支持系统面临关键挑战：在实现高预测准确性的同时，生成与预测一致的医学解释。现有方法存在暴露偏差问题，导致解释与预测不匹配。

Method: 提出Reason2Decide两阶段训练框架：第一阶段训练模型生成解释（rationale generation），第二阶段联合训练标签预测和解释生成，采用计划采样逐步从基于黄金标签转向基于模型预测。

Result: 在三个医学数据集上评估，包括专有分诊数据集和公共生物医学QA数据集。Reason2Decide在预测（F1）和解释保真度（BERTScore、BLEU、LLM-as-a-Judge）方面优于其他微调基线和一些零样本LLM。在分诊任务中，对LLM生成、护士撰写和护士后处理的解释都表现出鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Reason2Decide能够使用比当代基础模型小40倍的模型实现高性能，使临床推理在资源受限环境中更易部署，同时提供可解释的决策支持。LLM生成的解释适合用于模型预训练，减少对人类标注的依赖。

Abstract: Despite the wide adoption of Large Language Models (LLM)s, clinical decision support systems face a critical challenge: achieving high predictive accuracy while generating explanations aligned with the predictions. Current approaches suffer from exposure bias leading to misaligned explanations. We propose Reason2Decide, a two-stage training framework that addresses key challenges in self-rationalization, including exposure bias and task separation. In Stage-1, our model is trained on rationale generation, while in Stage-2, we jointly train on label prediction and rationale generation, applying scheduled sampling to gradually transition from conditioning on gold labels to model predictions. We evaluate Reason2Decide on three medical datasets, including a proprietary triage dataset and public biomedical QA datasets. Across model sizes, Reason2Decide outperforms other fine-tuning baselines and some zero-shot LLMs in prediction (F1) and rationale fidelity (BERTScore, BLEU, LLM-as-a-Judge). In triage, Reason2Decide is rationale source-robust across LLM-generated, nurse-authored, and nurse-post-processed rationales. In our experiments, while using only LLM-generated rationales in Stage-1, Reason2Decide outperforms other fine-tuning variants. This indicates that LLM-generated rationales are suitable for pretraining models, reducing reliance on human annotations. Remarkably, Reason2Decide achieves these gains with models 40x smaller than contemporary foundation models, making clinical reasoning more accessible for resource-constrained deployments while still providing explainable decision support.

Conclusion: 结合指令微调的大语言模型、动态反馈和强化学习，能够实现稳健、市场感知的金融情感建模，为投资决策和市场风险评估提供更可靠的依据。

Abstract: Financial sentiment analysis plays a crucial role in informing investment decisions, assessing market risk, and predicting stock price trends. Existing works in financial sentiment analysis have not considered the impact of stock prices or market feedback on sentiment analysis. In this paper, we propose an adaptive framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) with real-world stock market feedback to improve sentiment classification in the context of the Indian stock market. The proposed methodology fine-tunes the LLaMA 3.2 3B model using instruction-based learning on the SentiFin dataset. To enhance sentiment predictions, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline is employed that dynamically selects multi-source contextual information based on the cosine similarity of the sentence embeddings. Furthermore, a feedback-driven module is introduced that adjusts the reliability of the source by comparing predicted sentiment with actual next-day stock returns, allowing the system to iteratively adapt to market behavior. To generalize this adaptive mechanism across temporal data, a reinforcement learning agent trained using proximal policy optimization (PPO) is incorporated. The PPO agent learns to optimize source weighting policies based on cumulative reward signals from sentiment-return alignment. Experimental results on NIFTY 50 news headlines collected from 2024 to 2025 demonstrate that the proposed system significantly improves classification accuracy, F1-score, and market alignment over baseline models and static retrieval methods.

TL;DR: MolAct是一个基于智能体强化学习的分子设计框架，通过两阶段训练（先学编辑能力，再学优化）实现多步分子编辑与优化，在多项任务上超越现有基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分子编辑和优化是多步骤问题，需要迭代改进性质同时保持化学有效性和结构相似性。现有方法缺乏将分子设计形式化为智能体强化学习问题的框架，无法有效结合推理、工具使用和分子优化。

Method: 提出MolAct框架，将分子设计形式化为序列化、工具指导的决策问题。采用两阶段训练：第一阶段学习编辑能力，第二阶段重用编辑行为优化性质。智能体通过多轮交互调用化学工具进行有效性检查、性质评估和相似性控制，并根据反馈优化后续编辑。

Result: 在分子编辑任务中，MolEditAgent-7B在添加、删除和替换编辑上分别达到100、95和98的有效性，优于DeepSeek-R1等基线；MolEditAgent-3B性能接近Qwen3-32B-think。在分子优化任务中，MolOptAgent-7B在LogP指标上超越Claude 3.7，在溶解度上保持竞争力，并在其他目标上保持平衡性能。

Conclusion: 将分子设计视为多步骤、工具增强的过程是实现可靠且可解释改进的关键。MolAct框架首次将分子设计形式化为智能体强化学习问题，展示了智能体学习交织推理、工具使用和分子优化的潜力。

Abstract: Molecular editing and optimization are multi-step problems that require iteratively improving properties while keeping molecules chemically valid and structurally similar. We frame both tasks as sequential, tool-guided decisions and introduce MolAct, an agentic reinforcement learning framework that employs a two-stage training paradigm: first building editing capability, then optimizing properties while reusing the learned editing behaviors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to formalize molecular design as an Agentic Reinforcement Learning problem, where an LLM agent learns to interleave reasoning, tool-use, and molecular optimization. The framework enables agents to interact in multiple turns, invoking chemical tools for validity checking, property assessment, and similarity control, and leverages their feedback to refine subsequent edits. We instantiate the MolAct framework to train two model families: MolEditAgent for molecular editing tasks and MolOptAgent for molecular optimization tasks. In molecular editing, MolEditAgent-7B delivers 100, 95, and 98 valid add, delete, and substitute edits, outperforming strong closed "thinking" baselines such as DeepSeek-R1; MolEditAgent-3B approaches the performance of much larger open "thinking" models like Qwen3-32B-think. In molecular optimization, MolOptAgent-7B (trained on MolEditAgent-7B) surpasses the best closed "thinking" baseline (e.g., Claude 3.7) on LogP and remains competitive on solubility, while maintaining balanced performance across other objectives. These results highlight that treating molecular design as a multi-step, tool-augmented process is key to reliable and interpretable improvements.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 通过向原始时间序列注入噪声来提升冻结大语言模型在零样本时间序列预测中的性能，无需微调即可增强模型的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在利用完全冻结的大语言模型进行时间序列预测时，性能高度依赖于输入数据的文本表示，因为模型参数无法适应分布变化。需要一种简单有效的方法来克服这种脆弱性。

Method: 在时间序列数据tokenization之前向原始数据注入噪声，作为一种推理时增强策略，迫使冻结的LLM基于稳健的底层时间模式而非表面数值伪影进行外推。

Result: 该方法在多个基准测试中表现出有效性。特别地，在专门设计的两个新时间序列数据集上（确保不在LLM预训练范围内），一致观察到性能提升，排除了数据污染偏差。

Conclusion: 噪声注入是一种简单而有效的策略，能够增强冻结大语言模型在时间序列预测中的鲁棒性，为直接利用现成LLM进行时间序列预测提供了进一步进展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated effectiveness as zero-shot time series (TS) forecasters. The key challenge lies in tokenizing TS data into textual representations that align with LLMs' pre-trained knowledge. While existing work often relies on fine-tuning specialized modules to bridge this gap, a distinct, yet challenging, paradigm aims to leverage truly off-the-shelf LLMs without any fine-tuning whatsoever, relying solely on strategic tokenization of numerical sequences. The performance of these fully frozen models is acutely sensitive to the textual representation of the input data, as their parameters cannot adapt to distribution shifts. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet highly effective strategy to overcome this brittleness: injecting noise into the raw time series before tokenization. This non-invasive intervention acts as a form of inference-time augmentation, compelling the frozen LLM to extrapolate based on robust underlying temporal patterns rather than superficial numerical artifacts. We theoretically analyze this phenomenon and empirically validate its effectiveness across diverse benchmarks. Notably, to fully eliminate potential biases from data contamination during LLM pre-training, we introduce two novel TS datasets that fall outside all utilized LLMs' pre-training scopes, and consistently observe improved performance. This study provides a further step in directly leveraging off-the-shelf LLMs for time series forecasting.

Conclusion: BiGRU模型在数据中心PUE预测方面具有优越性，为数据中心能效优化提供了有效的预测工具。通过理解各特征对能耗的影响，可以针对性地改进数据中心运营，提高能源效率，促进可持续发展。

Abstract: Data centers account for significant global energy consumption and a carbon footprint. The recent increasing demand for edge computing and AI advancements drives the growth of data center storage capacity. Energy efficiency is a cost-effective way to combat climate change, cut energy costs, improve business competitiveness, and promote IT and environmental sustainability. Thus, optimizing data center energy management is the most important factor in the sustainability of the world. Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) is used to represent the operational efficiency of the data center. Predicting PUE using Neural Networks provides an understanding of the effect of each feature on energy consumption, thus enabling targeted modifications of those key features to improve energy efficiency. In this paper, we have developed Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) based PUE prediction model and compared the model performance with GRU. The data set comprises 52,560 samples with 117 features using EnergyPlus, simulating a DC in Singapore. Sets of the most relevant features are selected using the Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation (RFECV) algorithm for different parameter settings. These feature sets are used to find the optimal hyperparameter configuration and train the BiGRU model. The performance of the optimized BiGRU-based PUE prediction model is then compared with that of GRU using mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R-squared metrics.

Motivation: 研究人类与大型语言模型在概念推理任务中的泛化能力差异，探究两者在归纳偏置和推理策略上的根本区别

Method: 使用数字游戏作为概念推理任务，以贝叶斯模型为分析框架，比较人类和LLM的归纳偏置和推理策略

Result: 贝叶斯模型能更好地捕捉人类行为：人类灵活推断基于规则和相似性的概念，而LLM更依赖数学规则；人类能从单个示例进行少样本泛化，而LLM需要更多样本

Conclusion: 人类与LLM在数学概念推理和泛化方面存在根本差异，揭示了当前LLM与人类认知能力的重要区别

Abstract: We compare human and large language model (LLM) generalization in the number game, a concept inference task. Using a Bayesian model as an analytical framework, we examined the inductive biases and inference strategies of humans and LLMs. The Bayesian model captured human behavior better than LLMs in that humans flexibly infer rule-based and similarity-based concepts, whereas LLMs rely more on mathematical rules. Humans also demonstrated a few-shot generalization, even from a single example, while LLMs required more samples to generalize. These contrasts highlight the fundamental differences in how humans and LLMs infer and generalize mathematical concepts.

TL;DR: 提出PreSa方法，通过偏好学习和安全对齐直接学习安全策略，避免显式学习奖励和成本模型，在连续控制任务中优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线偏好强化学习(PbRL)避免了人工奖励工程和实时交互，但安全性仍是关键挑战。现有基于人类反馈的安全RL方法先学习奖励和成本模型，再用约束RL优化策略，在长时域连续控制任务中误差会累积，导致性能下降

Method: 提出PreSa框架：1) 直接基于行为偏好和轨迹段安全标签学习策略；2) 结合偏好学习模块和安全对齐的约束优化问题；3) 在拉格朗日框架内求解，直接学习奖励最大化且安全的策略，无需显式学习奖励和成本模型

Result: 在连续控制任务上，使用合成和真实人类反馈进行评估，PreSa成功学习到高奖励的安全策略，优于最先进的基线方法，甚至优于使用真实奖励和成本的离线安全RL方法

Conclusion: PreSa通过直接学习安全策略，避免了传统方法中奖励和成本模型误差累积的问题，在离线偏好强化学习中实现了更好的安全性和性能平衡

Abstract: Offline Preference-based Reinforcement Learning (PbRL) learns rewards and policies aligned with human preferences without the need for extensive reward engineering and direct interaction with human annotators. However, ensuring safety remains a critical challenge across many domains and tasks. Previous works on safe RL from human feedback (RLHF) first learn reward and cost models from offline data, then use constrained RL to optimize a safe policy. While such an approach works in the contextual bandits settings (LLMs), in long horizon continuous control tasks, errors in rewards and costs accumulate, leading to impairment in performance when used with constrained RL methods. To address these challenges, (a) instead of indirectly learning policies (from rewards and costs), we introduce a framework that learns a policy directly based on pairwise preferences regarding the agent's behavior in terms of rewards, as well as binary labels indicating the safety of trajectory segments; (b) we propose \textsc{PreSa} (Preference and Safety Alignment), a method that combines preference learning module with safety alignment in a constrained optimization problem. This optimization problem is solved within a Lagrangian paradigm that directly learns reward-maximizing safe policy \textit{without explicitly learning reward and cost models}, avoiding the need for constrained RL; (c) we evaluate our approach on continuous control tasks with both synthetic and real human feedback. Empirically, our method successfully learns safe policies with high rewards, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines, and offline safe RL approaches with ground-truth reward and cost.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) rapidly advances, especially in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), research focus is shifting from single-modality text processing to the more complex domains of multimodal and embodied AI. Embodied intelligence focuses on training agents within realistic simulated environments, leveraging physical interaction and action feedback rather than conventionally labeled datasets. Yet, most existing simulation platforms remain narrowly designed, each tailored to specific tasks. A versatile, general-purpose training environment that can support everything from low-level embodied navigation to high-level composite activities, such as multi-agent social simulation and human-AI collaboration, remains largely unavailable. To bridge this gap, we introduce TongSIM, a high-fidelity, general-purpose platform for training and evaluating embodied agents. TongSIM offers practical advantages by providing over 100 diverse, multi-room indoor scenarios as well as an open-ended, interaction-rich outdoor town simulation, ensuring broad applicability across research needs. Its comprehensive evaluation framework and benchmarks enable precise assessment of agent capabilities, such as perception, cognition, decision-making, human-robot cooperation, and spatial and social reasoning. With features like customized scenes, task-adaptive fidelity, diverse agent types, and dynamic environmental simulation, TongSIM delivers flexibility and scalability for researchers, serving as a unified platform that accelerates training, evaluation, and advancement toward general embodied intelligence.

TL;DR: MemR³是一个为LLM代理设计的记忆检索系统，通过闭环控制机制优化记忆检索过程，包含路由器和全局证据缺口追踪器，显著提升RAG性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有记忆系统主要关注压缩和存储优化，但对记忆检索的显式闭环控制关注不足。作者希望构建一个自主、准确、兼容的记忆检索系统，改进标准的检索-回答流程。

Method: 提出MemR³系统，包含两个核心机制：1）路由器：在检索、反思和回答三个动作中选择以优化答案质量；2）全局证据缺口追踪器：显式呈现回答过程透明度并追踪证据收集过程。该系统采用闭环控制机制实现自主决策。

Result: 在LoCoMo基准测试中，MemR³超越了强基线模型，在LLM-as-a-Judge评分上表现优异。特别地，它改进了四类现有检索器的性能，使用GPT-4.1-mini后端时，RAG提升7.29%，Zep提升1.94%。

Conclusion: MemR³为现有记忆存储提供了一个即插即用的控制器，通过闭环控制机制显著提升了记忆检索系统的性能，为LLM代理的记忆系统设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Memory systems have been designed to leverage past experiences in Large Language Model (LLM) agents. However, many deployed memory systems primarily optimize compression and storage, with comparatively less emphasis on explicit, closed-loop control of memory retrieval. From this observation, we build memory retrieval as an autonomous, accurate, and compatible agent system, named MemR$^3$, which has two core mechanisms: 1) a router that selects among retrieve, reflect, and answer actions to optimize answer quality; 2) a global evidence-gap tracker that explicitly renders the answering process transparent and tracks the evidence collection process. This design departs from the standard retrieve-then-answer pipeline by introducing a closed-loop control mechanism that enables autonomous decision-making. Empirical results on the LoCoMo benchmark demonstrate that MemR$^3$ surpasses strong baselines on LLM-as-a-Judge score, and particularly, it improves existing retrievers across four categories with an overall improvement on RAG (+7.29%) and Zep (+1.94%) using GPT-4.1-mini backend, offering a plug-and-play controller for existing memory stores.

TL;DR: G-SPEC是一个神经符号框架，通过确定性验证约束概率规划，解决5G/6G网络中LLM代理的随机风险问题，在450节点5G核心网模拟中实现零安全违规和94.1%的修复成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 5G独立组网和6G网络演进中，运营商面临超出静态自动化和深度强化学习能力的编排挑战。虽然大型语言模型代理为实现意图驱动网络提供了路径，但它们引入了随机风险，包括拓扑幻觉和政策不合规问题。

Method: 提出Graph-Symbolic Policy Enforcement and Control (G-SPEC)神经符号框架，通过确定性验证约束概率规划。架构基于治理三元组：电信适配代理(TSLAM-4B)、网络知识图谱(NKG)和SHACL约束。

Result: 在450节点5G核心网模拟中，G-SPEC实现了零安全违规和94.1%的修复成功率，显著优于82.4%的基线。消融分析显示NKG验证贡献了68%的安全增益，SHACL策略贡献24%。在10K到100K节点拓扑上的可扩展性测试表明验证延迟按O(k^1.2)缩放。

Conclusion: G-SPEC通过神经符号方法有效缓解了LLM代理在网络编排中的随机风险，处理开销142ms，适合SMO层操作，为5G/6G网络的安全自动化提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: As networks evolve toward 5G Standalone and 6G, operators face orchestration challenges that exceed the limits of static automation and Deep Reinforcement Learning. Although Large Language Model (LLM) agents offer a path toward intent-based networking, they introduce stochastic risks, including topology hallucinations and policy non-compliance. To mitigate this, we propose Graph-Symbolic Policy Enforcement and Control (G-SPEC), a neuro-symbolic framework that constrains probabilistic planning with deterministic verification. The architecture relies on a Governance Triad - a telecom-adapted agent (TSLAM-4B), a Network Knowledge Graph (NKG), and SHACL constraints. We evaluated G-SPEC on a simulated 450-node 5G Core, achieving zero safety violations and a 94.1% remediation success rate, significantly outperforming the 82.4% baseline. Ablation analysis indicates that NKG validation drives the majority of safety gains (68%), followed by SHACL policies (24%). Scalability tests on topologies ranging from 10K to 100K nodes demonstrate that validation latency scales as $O(k^{1.2})$ where $k$ is subgraph size. With a processing overhead of 142ms, G-SPEC is viable for SMO-layer operations.

Conclusion: ActionFlow通过创新的调度和内存优化技术，有效解决了VLA模型在边缘设备上的推理延迟问题，为实时机器人控制提供了可行方案

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a unified paradigm for robotic perception and control, enabling emergent generalization and long-horizon task execution. However, their deployment in dynamic, real-world environments is severely hin dered by high inference latency. While smooth robotic interaction requires control frequencies of 20 to 30 Hz, current VLA models typi cally operate at only 3-5 Hz on edge devices due to the memory bound nature of autoregressive decoding. Existing optimizations often require extensive retraining or compromise model accuracy. To bridge this gap, we introduce ActionFlow, a system-level inference framework tailored for resource-constrained edge plat forms. At the core of ActionFlow is a Cross-Request Pipelin ing strategy, a novel scheduler that redefines VLA inference as a macro-pipeline of micro-requests. The strategy intelligently batches memory-bound Decode phases with compute-bound Prefill phases across continuous time steps to maximize hardware utilization. Furthermore, to support this scheduling, we propose a Cross Request State Packed Forward operator and a Unified KV Ring Buffer, which fuse fragmented memory operations into efficient dense computations. Experimental results demonstrate that ActionFlow achieves a 2.55x improvement in FPS on the OpenVLA-7B model without retraining, enabling real-time dy namic manipulation on edge hardware.

Abstract: While CodeMem establishes executable code as the optimal representation for agentic procedural memory, the mechanism for autonomously synthesizing this memory from a blank slate remains underexplored. This paper operationalizes the transition of Large Language Models from passive tool-users to active workflow architects. Through a high-fidelity case study of a cross-service orchestration task involving Outlook and OneDrive, we identify and address four structural bottlenecks in automated skill generation: the Discovery Gap involving navigation of large tool registries, the Verification Gap regarding grounding tool response structures, the Decomposition Gap which replaces inefficient search with Linear State Anchoring, and the Scaling Gap focused on concurrency and persistence. We demonstrate that by enforcing a scientific methodology of hypothesize, probe, and code, agents can autonomously write robust, production-grade code skills.

Conclusion: SynCraft通过推理驱动的结构编辑方法，有效解决生成分子的可合成性问题，在保持结构新颖性的同时提高合成可行性，展示了LLMs在化学推理中的潜力

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence has revolutionized the exploration of chemical space, yet a critical bottleneck remains that a substantial fraction of generated molecules is synthetically inaccessible. Current solutions, such as post-hoc filtering or projection-based methods, often compromise structural novelty or disrupt key pharmacophores by forcing molecules into pre-defined synthetic templates. Herein, we introduce SynCraft, a reasoning-based framework that reframes synthesizability optimization not as a sequence translation task, but as a precise structural editing problem. Leveraging the emergent reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models, SynCraft navigates the "synthesis cliff" where minimal structural modifications yield significant gains in synthetic feasibility. By predicting executable sequences of atom-level edits rather than generating SMILES strings directly, SynCraft circumvents the syntactic fragility of LLMs while harnessing their chemical intuition. Extensive benchmarks demonstrate that SynCraft outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in generating synthesizable analogs with high structural fidelity. Furthermore, through interaction-aware prompting, SynCraft successfully replicates expert medicinal chemistry intuition in editing PLK1 inhibitors and rescuing high-scoring but previously discarded RIPK1 candidates in previous molecular generation literatures.

Conclusion: 这项工作为生成式数字孪生奠定了基础，将视觉推理和语言理解整合到可执行的工业仿真系统中，实现了跨模态的工业仿真代码生成。

Abstract: We propose a Vision-Language Simulation Model (VLSM) that unifies visual and textual understanding to synthesize executable FlexScript from layout sketches and natural-language prompts, enabling cross-modal reasoning for industrial simulation systems. To support this new paradigm, the study constructs the first large-scale dataset for generative digital twins, comprising over 120,000 prompt-sketch-code triplets that enable multimodal learning between textual descriptions, spatial structures, and simulation logic. In parallel, three novel evaluation metrics, Structural Validity Rate (SVR), Parameter Match Rate (PMR), and Execution Success Rate (ESR), are proposed specifically for this task to comprehensively evaluate structural integrity, parameter fidelity, and simulator executability. Through systematic ablation across vision encoders, connectors, and code-pretrained language backbones, the proposed models achieve near-perfect structural accuracy and high execution robustness. This work establishes a foundation for generative digital twins that integrate visual reasoning and language understanding into executable industrial simulation systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出Bohrium+SciMaster架构，通过基础设施和生态系统方法解决规模化智能体科学面临的挑战，实现科学工作流的可观测、可重现和可治理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI智能体正在成为运行多步骤科学工作流的实用方式，但规模化智能体科学面临四大挑战：工作流难以观测和重现；许多工具和实验室系统不支持智能体；执行难以追踪和治理；原型AI科学家系统通常是定制的，限制了重用和系统性改进。

Result: 在11个代表性主智能体的真实工作流中演示了该架构，实现了端到端科学周期时间的数量级减少，并从真实工作负载中生成了数百万规模的执行基础信号。

Conclusion: 规模化智能体科学需要基础设施和生态系统方法，Bohrium+SciMaster架构通过提供可追溯、可组合、可审计的工作流执行环境，为智能体科学的规模化应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: AI agents are emerging as a practical way to run multi-step scientific workflows that interleave reasoning with tool use and verification, pointing to a shift from isolated AI-assisted steps toward \emph{agentic science at scale}. This shift is increasingly feasible, as scientific tools and models can be invoked through stable interfaces and verified with recorded execution traces, and increasingly necessary, as AI accelerates scientific output and stresses the peer-review and publication pipeline, raising the bar for traceability and credible evaluation.
  However, scaling agentic science remains difficult: workflows are hard to observe and reproduce; many tools and laboratory systems are not agent-ready; execution is hard to trace and govern; and prototype AI Scientist systems are often bespoke, limiting reuse and systematic improvement from real workflow signals.
  We argue that scaling agentic science requires an infrastructure-and-ecosystem approach, instantiated in Bohrium+SciMaster. Bohrium acts as a managed, traceable hub for AI4S assets -- akin to a HuggingFace of AI for Science -- that turns diverse scientific data, software, compute, and laboratory systems into agent-ready capabilities. SciMaster orchestrates these capabilities into long-horizon scientific workflows, on which scientific agents can be composed and executed. Between infrastructure and orchestration, a \emph{scientific intelligence substrate} organizes reusable models, knowledge, and components into executable building blocks for workflow reasoning and action, enabling composition, auditability, and improvement through use.
  We demonstrate this stack with eleven representative master agents in real workflows, achieving orders-of-magnitude reductions in end-to-end scientific cycle time and generating execution-grounded signals from real workloads at multi-million scale.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究比较了大型语言模型（LLMs）与小型语言模型（SLMs）在预测危重患者休克方面的表现，发现尽管GatorTron-Base获得最高加权召回率80.5%，但LLMs在预测临床事件方面并不天然优于SLMs。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在自然语言处理领域广泛应用，但在预测性任务中的应用研究较少。及时预测休克可以促进早期干预，改善患者预后，因此需要评估LLMs在临床预测任务中的表现。

Method: 使用MIMIC III数据库中17,294次ICU住院的文本数据，筛选出住院时间>24小时且休克指数>0.7的患者（正常组355人，异常组87人）。比较了GatorTron-Base（临床数据训练）、Llama 8B、Mistral 7B等LLMs与BioBERT、DocBERT、BioClinicalBERT、Word2Vec、Doc2Vec等SLMs。在微调时使用focal loss和交叉熵损失来处理类别不平衡问题。

Result: GatorTron-Base获得了最高的加权召回率80.5%，但LLMs和SLMs的整体性能指标相当。这表明LLMs在预测未来临床事件方面并不天然优于SLMs，尽管它们在文本任务上表现优异。

Conclusion: 为了获得有意义的临床结果，未来训练LLMs的努力应优先开发能够预测临床轨迹的模型，而不是专注于命名实体识别或表型分析等较简单的任务。

Abstract: With the advent of LLMs, various tasks across the natural language processing domain have been transformed. However, their application in predictive tasks remains less researched. This study compares large language models, including GatorTron-Base (trained on clinical data), Llama 8B, and Mistral 7B, against models like BioBERT, DocBERT, BioClinicalBERT, Word2Vec, and Doc2Vec, setting benchmarks for predicting Shock in critically ill patients. Timely prediction of shock can enable early interventions, thus improving patient outcomes. Text data from 17,294 ICU stays of patients in the MIMIC III database were scored for length of stay > 24 hours and shock index (SI) > 0.7 to yield 355 and 87 patients with normal and abnormal SI-index, respectively. Both focal and cross-entropy losses were used during finetuning to address class imbalances. Our findings indicate that while GatorTron Base achieved the highest weighted recall of 80.5%, the overall performance metrics were comparable between SLMs and LLMs. This suggests that LLMs are not inherently superior to SLMs in predicting future clinical events despite their strong performance on text-based tasks. To achieve meaningful clinical outcomes, future efforts in training LLMs should prioritize developing models capable of predicting clinical trajectories rather than focusing on simpler tasks such as named entity recognition or phenotyping.

Motivation: 教师情感状态对教学效果、学生参与度和学习成就具有重要影响，但现有研究因教师表演性质而难以准确捕捉情感，且忽视了教学信息对情感表达的关键影响。

Method: 1) 构建T-MED数据集：采用人机协同标注流程，包含14,938个教师情感实例，涵盖250个真实课堂的文本、音频、视频和教学信息；2) 提出AAM-TSA模型：引入非对称注意力机制和分层门控单元，实现差异化跨模态特征融合和精确情感分类。

Result: 实验结果表明，AAM-TSA模型在T-MED数据集上的准确性和可解释性显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该研究通过构建大规模多模态数据集和创新模型，系统解决了教师情感分析中的关键挑战，为教育场景中的教师情感识别提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Teachers' emotional states are critical in educational scenarios, profoundly impacting teaching efficacy, student engagement, and learning achievements. However, existing studies often fail to accurately capture teachers' emotions due to the performative nature and overlook the critical impact of instructional information on emotional expression.In this paper, we systematically investigate teacher sentiment analysis by building both the dataset and the model accordingly. We construct the first large-scale teacher multimodal sentiment analysis dataset, T-MED.To ensure labeling accuracy and efficiency, we employ a human-machine collaborative labeling process.The T-MED dataset includes 14,938 instances of teacher emotional data from 250 real classrooms across 11 subjects ranging from K-12 to higher education, integrating multimodal text, audio, video, and instructional information.Furthermore, we propose a novel asymmetric attention-based multimodal teacher sentiment analysis model, AAM-TSA.AAM-TSA introduces an asymmetric attention mechanism and hierarchical gating unit to enable differentiated cross-modal feature fusion and precise emotional classification. Experimental results demonstrate that AAM-TSA significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and interpretability on the T-MED dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 立体定向放射外科需要精确的剂量塑造，但黑盒AI系统因透明度问题临床采用有限。研究旨在测试链式思考推理是否能改善代理规划，提供透明、可审计的自动化规划方案。

Method: 开发SAGE LLM规划代理，在41例脑转移瘤患者的回顾性队列中测试。比较推理模型与非推理模型生成的计划，评估剂量学指标和规划行为。

Result: 推理模型在主要终点（PTV覆盖率、最大剂量、适形指数、梯度指数）上与人类规划师相当，同时显著降低耳蜗剂量。推理模型展现出前瞻性约束验证和权衡审议等系统性规划行为，而非推理模型几乎没有这些过程。

Conclusion: 链式思考推理使LLM规划代理能够产生透明、可审计的自动化放射外科计划，在保持临床质量的同时提供解释性，为临床采用提供了路径。

Abstract: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) demands precise dose shaping around critical structures, yet black-box AI systems have limited clinical adoption due to opacity concerns. We tested whether chain-of-thought reasoning improves agentic planning in a retrospective cohort of 41 patients with brain metastases treated with 18 Gy single-fraction SRS. We developed SAGE (Secure Agent for Generative Dose Expertise), an LLM-based planning agent for automated SRS treatment planning. Two variants generated plans for each case: one using a non-reasoning model, one using a reasoning model. The reasoning variant showed comparable plan dosimetry relative to human planners on primary endpoints (PTV coverage, maximum dose, conformity index, gradient index; all p > 0.21) while reducing cochlear dose below human baselines (p = 0.022). When prompted to improve conformity, the reasoning model demonstrated systematic planning behaviors including prospective constraint verification (457 instances) and trade-off deliberation (609 instances), while the standard model exhibited none of these deliberative processes (0 and 7 instances, respectively). Content analysis revealed that constraint verification and causal explanation concentrated in the reasoning agent. The optimization traces serve as auditable logs, offering a path toward transparent automated planning.

Motivation: 现有方法在长视频QA中通常将内容压缩为有损摘要或依赖有限工具集，导致时间定位能力弱且错过细粒度线索。需要一种能更好地处理小时级视频推理的方法。

Method: 采用多智能体框架：主LLM协调定位智能体（定位问题相关片段）和视觉智能体（提取目标文本观察）。主智能体有步骤限制，通过强化学习训练以实现简洁、正确、高效的多智能体协作。

Result: 在提出的LongTVQA和LongTVQA+数据集上，多智能体系统显著优于强非智能体基线。实验显示强化学习进一步增强了训练智能体的推理和规划能力。

Conclusion: 该多智能体框架通过协调定位和视觉智能体，在长视频QA中实现了更好的时间定位、视觉细节补充和可解释轨迹，为小时级视频推理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal LLMs and systems that use tools for long-video QA point to the promise of reasoning over hour-long episodes. However, many methods still compress content into lossy summaries or rely on limited toolsets, weakening temporal grounding and missing fine-grained cues. We propose a multi-agent framework in which a master LLM coordinates a grounding agent to localize question-relevant segments and a vision agent to extract targeted textual observations. The master agent plans with a step limit, and is trained with reinforcement learning to encourage concise, correct, and efficient multi-agent cooperation. This design helps the master agent focus on relevant clips via grounding, complements subtitles with visual detail, and yields interpretable trajectories. On our proposed LongTVQA and LongTVQA+ which are episode-level datasets aggregated from TVQA/TVQA+, our multi-agent system significantly outperforms strong non-agent baselines. Experiments also show reinforcement learning further strengthens reasoning and planning for the trained agent. Code and data will be shared at https://longvideoagent.github.io/.

Motivation: 稀土元素对绿色技术至关重要，但印度主要依赖进口，供应链存在障碍，创新和回收仍处于早期阶段。为实现2047年发达印度愿景，确保可持续稀土供应对能源安全和技术独立至关重要。

Method: 探索印度在稀土领域的机会和挑战，重点关注铜尾矿、粉煤灰和电子废弃物等未充分利用资源，提出循环经济路径，并分析HCL作为垂直整合铜生产商的独特优势。

Result: 识别出印度可通过循环经济减少环境影响并加强国内供应链的机会，HCL可通过稀土协同回收、研发合作和供应链建设，成为该领域的国家冠军。

Abstract: The global impetus for extracting rare earth elements (REEs) is shaping the future of green technologies. From high-efficiency magnets in wind turbines to advanced batteries and solar photovoltaics, REEs are indispensable for a greener world through the energy transition. However, supply chains remain a barrier for the majority of the global population. India is mainly dependent on imports for most REEs. Innovation and recycling efforts in most REEs are still in their early stages. For India, aspiring to Viksit Bharat by 2047, securing sustainable REE access is critical to national energy security and technological independence. This paper explores India's opportunities and challenges in the REE domain, high-lighting underutilized resources such as copper tailings, fly ash, and e-waste. We argue for circular economy pathways that can reduce environmental impacts and strengthen domestic supply. Hindustan Copper Limited (HCL), as India's sole vertically integrated copper producer, is uniquely positioned to pioneer co-recovery of REEs, advance research and development partnerships, and build a comprehensive supply chain. By embedding sustainability, ESG principles, and community trust in its strategy, HCL can evolve into a national champion in this domain.

Motivation: SNAP行为风险因素是慢性病和医疗成本的主要贡献者，其流行不仅受人口特征影响，还受社会经济和职业环境等情境因素影响。现有研究需要更精细地理解职业环境如何调节社会人口因素对健康行为的影响。

Method: 1. 使用意大利PASSI健康监测系统数据；2. 采用结构主题建模（STM）对自由文本职业描述进行聚类，形成潜在职业群体；3. 建立多元有序probit模型，职业集群作为混合权重；4. 协变量效应允许跨职业集群变化并随时间演化；5. 使用非局部spike-and-slab先验增强可解释性和变量选择；6. 基于顺序蒙特卡洛的在线学习算法实现数据更新。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种创新的贝叶斯建模框架，通过整合职业文本信息，能够更精细地分析职业环境对健康行为的影响，为公共卫生政策制定提供了新的分析工具和方法论支持。

Abstract: Behavioral risk factors, i.e., smoking, poor nutrition, alcohol misuse, and physical inactivity (SNAP), are leading contributors to chronic diseases and healthcare costs worldwide. Their prevalence is shaped %not only by demographic characteristics %but and also by contextual ones such as socioeconomic and occupational environments. In this study, we leverage data from the Italian health and behavioral surveillance system PASSI to model SNAP behaviors through a Bayesian framework that integrates textual information on occupations. We use Structural Topic Modeling (STM) to cluster free-text job descriptions into latent occupational groups, which inform mixture weights in a multivariate ordered probit model. Covariate effects are allowed to vary across occupational clusters and evolve over time. To enhance interpretability and variable selection, we impose non-local spike-and-slab priors on regression coefficients. Finally, an online learning algorithm based on sequential Monte Carlo enables efficient updating as new data become available. This dynamic, scalable, and interpretable approach permits observing how occupational contexts modulate the impact of socio-demographic factors on health behaviors, providing valuable insights for targeted public health interventions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注英语社区或整体情况，缺乏对不同语言社区在众包事实核查中参与差异的研究，需要了解Community Notes在不同语言环境下是否可行。

Method: 通过分析X平台Community Notes项目中不同语言社区的参与数据，研究不同语言社区的参与模式和他们对专业事实核查资源的依赖程度。

Result: 1. Community Notes在某些语言社区中参与度高，但在其他社区中未能普及；2. 引用专业事实核查机构的笔记被认为更有帮助；3. 整体上对专业事实核查的依赖仍然很低。

Conclusion: 众包事实核查在不同语言社区中的适用性存在差异，虽然专业事实核查资源能提升笔记质量，但整体依赖度不高，表明Community Notes不能完全替代专业事实核查机构。

Abstract: Crowd-sourced fact-checking provides social media platforms with a promising method of managing misinformation at scale. However, the success of fact-checking programs like X's Community Notes requires the participation of a critical mass of note-writers who have the time and epistemic resources necessary to write and rate high-quality notes. As X's Community Notes program was first established in English-speaking countries, much academic research has focused on English-language notes or notes writ large. Relatively little research has investigated how different linguistic communities utilise Community Notes. Thus, it is unclear whether Community Notes or similar crowd-sourced fact-checking initiatives represent a viable alternative to social media platforms' partnerships with professional fact-checking organisations across linguistic contexts. This research identifies how different linguistic communities participate in volunteer fact-checking efforts on X's Community Notes program and addresses volunteers' reliance on professional fact-checking resources differs across languages. We find that while the Community Notes program has had strong uptake in some linguistic communities, the program has failed to catch on in others. Additionally, we confirm findings that notes that cite professional fact-checkers are considered more helpful, but show that reliance on professional fact-checking overall remains minimal.

Result: 仿真结果显示，通用干预在特定条件下可以抑制毒性，但基于心理画像的个性化审核在限制毒性行为传播和持久性方面显著更有效。

Conclusion: 该仿真框架为研究和设计复杂在线社交系统中的自适应审核策略提供了灵活可扩展的工具，个性化心理特征驱动的审核策略优于传统统一干预。

Abstract: The spread of toxic content on online platforms presents complex challenges that call for both theoretical insight and practical tools to test intervention strategies. In this novel research paper, we introduce a simulation-based framework that extends the classical SEIZ (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Skeptic) epidemic model to capture the dynamics of toxic message propagation. Our simulator incorporates active moderation mechanisms through two distinct variants: a basic moderator, which implements uniform, non-personalized interventions, and smart moderator, which leverages user-specific psychological profiles based on Dark Triad traits to apply personalized, threshold-driven moderation. By varying parameter configurations, the simulator allows for systematic exploration of how different moderation strategies influence user state transitions over time. Simulation results demonstrate that while generic interventions can curb toxicity under certain conditions, profile-aware moderation proves significantly more effective in limiting both the spread and persistence of toxic behavior. This simulation framework offers a flexible and extensible tool for studying and designing adaptive moderation strategies in complex online social systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗决策等场景中，插件预测常用于估计条件概率P(y|x)来选择治疗（A或B），但实际使用的预测模型常被错误指定，且通常使用固定阈值而非协变量特定阈值。需要理解这种错误指定对最大遗憾（MR）的影响。

Method: 结合代数分析和计算分析，研究插件预测在模型错误指定情况下的极限最大遗憾（MR），分析其如何依赖于极限估计值和治疗选择阈值。

Result: 揭示了极限MR如何依赖于极限估计值和治疗选择阈值，展示了模型错误指定对MR的影响机制。

Conclusion: 建议计划者在使用插件预测时，应联合选择预测模型、估计方法和协变量特定阈值，以实现满意的最大遗憾（MR）性能。

Abstract: We study the population limit maximum regret (MR) of plug-in prediction when the decision problem is to choose between two treatments for the members of a population with observed covariates x. In this setting, the optimal treatment for persons with covariate value x is B if the conditional probability P(y = 1|x) of a binary outcome y exceeds an x-specific known threshold and is A otherwise. This structure is common in medical decision making, as well as non-medical contexts. Plug-in prediction uses data to estimate P(y|x) and acts as if the estimate is accurate. We are concerned that the model used to estimate P(y|x) may be misspecified, with true conditional probabilities being outside the model space. In practice, plug-in prediction has been performed with a wide variety of prediction models that commonly are misspecified. Further, applications often use a conventional x-invariant threshold, whereas optimal treatment choice uses x-specific thresholds. The main contribution of this paper is to shed new light on limit MR when plug-in prediction is performed with misspecified models. We use a combination of algebraic and computational analysis to study limit MR, demonstrating how it depends on the limit estimate and on the thresholds used to choose treatments. We recommend that a planner who wants to use plug-in prediction to achieve satisfactory MR should jointly choose a predictive model, estimation method, and x-specific thresholds to accomplish this objective.

Motivation: 在非标准测试环境中，研究者常使用临时检验方法，这些方法虽然具有正确的渐近规模，但其最优性通常未知且难以评估，需要系统方法来评估这些检验的有效性

Method: 使用嵌套优化算法近似权重函数，使临时检验的加权平均功率尽可能接近真实加权平均功率最大化检验，形成近似功率包络

Result: 证明真实加权平均功率最大化检验的拒绝概率形成临时检验的近似功率包络，提供收敛保证，并应用于弱工具稳健条件似然比检验和边界参数检验

Conclusion: 该数值框架为评估临时检验的有效最优性提供了实用工具，可应用于多种非标准测试环境，有助于理解检验的统计性能

Abstract: In nonstandard testing environments, researchers often derive ad hoc tests with correct (asymptotic) size, but their optimality properties are typically unknown a priori and difficult to assess. This paper develops a numerical framework for determining whether an ad hoc test is effectively optimal - approximately maximizing a weighted average power criterion for some weights over the alternative and attaining a power envelope generated by a single weighted average power-maximizing test. Our approach uses nested optimization algorithms to approximate the weight function that makes an ad hoc test's weighted average power as close as possible to that of a true weighted average power-maximizing test, and we show the surprising result that the rejection probabilities corresponding to the latter form an approximate power envelope for the former. We provide convergence guarantees, discuss practical implementation and apply the method to the weak instrument-robust conditional likelihood ratio test and a recently-proposed test for when a nuisance parameter may be on or near its boundary.

TL;DR: 论文证明非线性经济动态是时变参数的必要充分条件，且时变参数由少数结构性冲击驱动，挑战了"结构不稳定性"的传统解释。实证显示宏观金融变量的时变参数可由少数因子解释，这些因子与宏观经济不确定性和金融对实体经济的贡献密切相关，且模型预测优于标准时变参数VAR。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统上，时变参数常被解释为"结构不稳定性"，但本文旨在从理论和实证上重新审视这一解释。作者希望证明时变参数实际上源于经济动态的非线性特征，而非结构本身的不稳定，并且这些时变参数由少数结构性冲击驱动。

Method: 1. 理论分析：证明非线性经济动态是时变参数的必要充分条件，且所有参数的时变性都由相同的少数结构性冲击驱动。2. 实证建模：使用时变参数VAR模型，但在时变参数中引入因子结构，以捕捉少数共同驱动因素。

Result: 1. 理论结果：挑战了时变参数源于"结构不稳定性"的传统观点，证明它们实际上反映了经济动态的非线性特征。2. 实证结果：宏观金融变量的时变参数主要由少数因子驱动，这些因子与宏观经济不确定性和金融对实体经济的贡献高度相关。3. 预测表现：因子结构的时变参数VAR模型预测优于标准的独立随机游走时变参数VAR模型。

Conclusion: 时变参数不应被简单解释为结构不稳定性，而是经济动态非线性的体现，且由少数结构性冲击驱动。这种理解有助于更准确地建模和预测宏观经济波动，并为政策分析提供更可靠的基础。

Abstract: For a general class of dynamic and stochastic structural models, we show that (i) non-linearity in economic dynamics is a necessary and sufficient condition for time-varying parameters (TVPs) in the reduced-form VARMA process followed by observables, and (ii) all parameters' time-variation is driven by the same, typically few sources of stochasticity: the structural shocks. Our results call into question the common interpretation that TVPs are due to "structural instabilities". Motivated by our theoretical analysis, we model a set of macroeconomic and financial variables as a TVP-VAR with a factor-structure in TVPs. This reveals that most instabilities are driven by a few factors, which comove strongly with measures of macroeconomic uncertainty and the contribution of finance to real economic activity, commonly emphasized as important sources of non-linearities in macroeconomics. Furthermore, our model yields improved forecasts relative to the standard TVP-VAR where TVPs evolve as independent random walks.

TL;DR: 将基于分数匹配的直接密度比估计方法扩展到Riesz表示器估计，以解决过拟合问题，并为因果推断提供新视角


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Riesz表示器是去偏机器学习中的关键组件，用于构建√n一致且高效的因果推断和结构参数估计器。现有的直接估计方法（如Riesz回归和协变量平衡倾向得分）容易因灵活模型和损失函数形式导致过拟合问题

Result: 提出的方法不仅缓解了过拟合问题，还通过时间分数函数将边际效应和平均政策效应联系起来，为因果推断提供了新的理论见解

Conclusion: 基于分数匹配的Riesz表示器估计方法为解决去偏机器学习中的过拟合问题提供了有效方案，并建立了因果推断中不同效应估计之间的联系

Abstract: This study proposes Riesz representer estimation methods based on score matching. The Riesz representer is a key component in debiased machine learning for constructing $\sqrt{n}$-consistent and efficient estimators in causal inference and structural parameter estimation. To estimate the Riesz representer, direct approaches have garnered attention, such as Riesz regression and the covariate balancing propensity score. These approaches can also be interpreted as variants of direct density ratio estimation (DRE) in several applications such as average treatment effect estimation. In DRE, it is well known that flexible models can easily overfit the observed data due to the estimand and the form of the loss function. To address this issue, recent work has proposed modeling the density ratio as a product of multiple intermediate density ratios and estimating it using score-matching techniques, which are often used in the diffusion model literature. We extend score-matching-based DRE methods to Riesz representer estimation. Our proposed method not only mitigates overfitting but also provides insights for causal inference by bridging marginal effects and average policy effects through time score functions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分析2017年"Attention Is All You Need"论文引发的学术标题命名现象，研究这种命名模式在机器学习领域的传播和影响，探讨学术传播中的竞争压力如何导致记忆性优先于精确性的趋势

Method: 收集2009-2025年间arXiv预印本中717篇包含"All You Need"的论文标题，进行统计分析，包括数量增长趋势、最常见的"X"词汇分布，并将此现象置于模因理论框架下分析

Result: 发现"All You Need"标题呈现指数增长（R² > 0.994），2025年达到200篇；在"X [Is] All You Need"结构中，"Attention"仍是最常见的词汇（28次）；该命名模式已成为机器学习领域最持久的命名惯例之一

Conclusion: 这种命名现象的成功反映了科学传播中日益增长的竞争压力，使得记忆性逐渐优先于精确性；作者以适当的自我意识，将这种趋势是否代表无害的学术趣味或症状性耸人听闻留给读者判断

Abstract: The 2017 paper ''Attention Is All You Need'' introduced the Transformer architecture-and inadvertently spawned one of machine learning's most persistent naming conventions. We analyze 717 arXiv preprints containing ''All You Need'' in their titles (2009-2025), finding exponential growth ($R^2$ > 0.994) following the original paper, with 200 titles in 2025 alone. Among papers following the canonical ''X [Is] All You Need'' structure, ''Attention'' remains the most frequently claimed necessity (28 occurrences). Situating this phenomenon within memetic theory, we argue the pattern's success reflects competitive pressures in scientific communication that increasingly favor memorability over precision. Whether this trend represents harmless academic whimsy or symptomatic sensationalism, we leave-with appropriate self-awareness-to the reader.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CS院系学生数量庞大，师生比例远超推荐标准（350:1 vs 250:1），导致学术监控和个性化反馈难以及时提供，需要可扩展的解决方案

Method: 开发CS-Guide系统，利用大语言模型处理学生每周提交的成绩自评和反思日记，从中提取定量和定性特征，触发定制化干预措施（如学术支持、健康转介）

Result: 在四年约2万条纵向数据集上评估，CS-Guide在为大一学生推荐干预措施方面达到97%的F1分数

Conclusion: CS-Guide能够通过整合学习分析、大语言模型和可操作干预，为学术指导系统提供可扩展、一致、及时且领域特定的反馈

Abstract: Computer Science (CS) departments often serve large student populations, making timely academic monitoring and personalized feedback difficult. While the recommended counselor-to-student ratio is 250:1, it often exceeds 350:1 in practice, leading to delays in support and interventions. We present CS-Guide, which leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to deliver scalable, frequent academic feedback. Weekly, students interact with CS-Guide through self-reported grades and reflective journal entries, from which CS-Guide extracts quantitative and qualitative features and triggers tailored interventions (e.g., academic support, health and wellness referrals). Thus, CS-Guide uniquely integrates learning analytics, LLMs, and actionable interventions using both structured and unstructured student-generated data.
  We evaluated CS-Guide on a four-year, ~20K-entry longitudinal dataset, and it achieved up to a 97% F1 score in recommending interventions for first-year students. This shows that CS-Guide can enhance advising systems with scalable, consistent, timely, and domain-specific feedback.

TL;DR: 提出DARL模型，利用边界条件实验数据和伪随机数模拟，预测地-空-水热交换器内部空气温度分布，减少对密集传感器网络的依赖，相对误差低于6.2%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地-空-水热交换器（EAWHE）用于可持续空调的研究不足，现有表征内部热空气分布的方法依赖密集传感器网络，导致数据采集和计算成本高昂。

Method: 提出DARL（空气数据和随机长度）模型，整合边界条件实验数据与基于伪随机数的模拟。使用费马素数作为种子初始化随机数生成器，通过普通线性回归和稳健统计验证（Shapiro-Wilk检验和均方根误差）评估模型性能。

Result: 模型能够以低于6.2%的相对误差估计不同长度处的空气热分布，证明了其效率、预测能力以及减少传感器依赖的潜力。

Conclusion: DARL模型是重要的方法学进步，能够有效预测EAWHE内部空气温度分布，显著减少对密集传感器网络的依赖，为可持续空调系统的研究和应用提供了实用工具。

Abstract: The use of Earth-Air-Water Heat Exchangers (EAWHE) for sustainable air conditioning has not been widely studied. Due to their experimental nature, methods of characterizing internal thermal air distribution impose high dependence on instrumentation by sensors and entail data acquisition and computational costs. This document presents an alternative method that estimates air temperature distribution while minimizing the need for a dense network of sensors in the experimental system. The proposed model, DARL (Data of Air and Random Length), can predict the temperature of air circulating inside EAWHEs. DARL is a significant methodological advance that integrates experimental data from boundary conditions with simulations based on pseudo-random numbers (PRNs). These PRNs are generated using Fermat's prime numbers as seeds to initialize the generator. Ordinary linear regressions and robust statistical validations, including the Shapiro-Wilk test and root mean square error, have demonstrated that the model can estimate the thermal distribution of air at different lengths with a relative error of less than 6.2%. These results demonstrate the model's efficiency, predictive capacity, and potential to reduce dependence on sensors.

Abstract: As systems engineering (SE) objectives evolve from design and operation of monolithic systems to complex System of Systems (SoS), the discipline of Mission Engineering (ME) has emerged which is increasingly being accepted as a new line of thinking for the SE community. Moreover, mission environments are uncertain, dynamic, and mission outcomes are a direct function of how the mission assets will interact with this environment. This proves static architectures brittle and calls for analytically rigorous approaches for ME. To that end, this paper proposes an intelligent mission coordination methodology that integrates digital mission models with Reinforcement Learning (RL), that specifically addresses the need for adaptive task allocation and reconfiguration. More specifically, we are leveraging a Digital Engineering (DE) based infrastructure that is composed of a high-fidelity digital mission model and agent-based simulation; and then we formulate the mission tactics management problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), and employ an RL agent trained via Proximal Policy Optimization. By leveraging the simulation as a sandbox, we map the system states to actions, refining the policy based on realized mission outcomes. The utility of the RL-based intelligent mission coordinator is demonstrated through an aerial firefighting case study. Our findings indicate that the RL-based intelligent mission coordinator not only surpasses baseline performance but also significantly reduces the variability in mission performance. Thus, this study serves as a proof of concept demonstrating that DE-enabled mission simulations combined with advanced analytical tools offer a mission-agnostic framework for improving ME practice; which can be extended to more complicated fleet design and selection problems in the future from a mission-first perspective.

Abstract: Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN) are emerging as critical enablers of global connectivity, particularly in remote, unserved, underserved, or maritime regions lacking traditional infrastructure. While much of the existing work on NTN focuses on theoretical or simulated evaluations, practical implementations remain limited. In this paper, we present SpaceNET, a transparent NTN testbed that leverages the Starlink Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite constellation in conjunction with Mininet-based emulation to perform end-to-end performance assessments across real-world maritime and terrestrial endpoints that can also be applied to 5th generation (5G). Specifically, we establish a bidirectional link between a ground terminal located in Blacksburg, Virginia, and a maritime terminal aboard a cruise ship near Key West, Florida. We report detailed transmission control protocol (TCP) throughput, user datagram protocol (UDP) throughput, and latency measurements using two different user terminals - a) Smartphone, and b) very small aperture terminal (VSAT), emphasizing the transparent nature of the NTN payload, where the satellite acts solely as a relay node. Our results provide new insights into the performance limits and reliability of commercial LEO-based NTN applications. The SpaceNET testbed offers a reproducible and extensible platform for future research in NTN routing, mobility support, and cross-layer optimization.

Conclusion: 基于FeFET的逻辑内存编码器为超维计算提供了面积和能效更优的解决方案，特别适用于复杂数据集处理任务

Abstract: Hyperdimensional (HD) computing involves encoding of baseline information into large hypervectors and repeated Boolean operations to generate the output class hypervectors which are stored in an associative memory. The classification task is then performed through similarity search operation. While prior studies have focused mostly on accelerating HD search operation using TCAMs based on emerging non-volatile memories, considering the dominant contribution of the encoder module to the energy and latency landscape specifically for complex datasets such as language recognition, DNA sequencing, etc., in this work, we propose energy- and area-efficient single FDSOI ferroelectric (Fe)FET-based logic-in-memory implementations of XOR and 3-input majority gates for N-gram HD encoders. We utilize the proposed FeFET-based encoder in a HD spam filtering accelerator and show that it outperforms the prior emerging non-volatile memory-based implementations in terms of area and energy-efficiency while exhibiting a high classification accuracy of 91.38% on the SMS Spam Collection dataset.
