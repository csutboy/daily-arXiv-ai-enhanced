Comments welcome", "summary": "This paper proposes methods for producing compound selection decisions in a Gaussian sequence model. Given unknown, fixed parameters $μ_ {1:n}$ and known $σ_{1:n}$ with observations $Y_i \\sim \\textsf{N}(μ_i, σ_i^2)$, the decision maker would like to select a subset of indices $S$ so as to maximize utility $\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i\\in S} (μ_i - K_i)$, for known costs $K_i$. Inspired by Stein's unbiased risk estimate (SURE), we introduce an almost unbiased estimator, called ASSURE, for the expected utility of a proposed decision rule. ASSURE allows a user to choose a welfare-maximizing rule from a pre-specified class by optimizing the estimated welfare, thereby producing selection decisions that borrow strength across noisy estimates. We show that ASSURE produces decision rules that are asymptotically no worse than the optimal but infeasible decision rule in the pre-specified class. We apply ASSURE to the selection of Census tracts for economic opportunity, the identification of discriminating firms, and the analysis of $p$-value decision procedures in A/B testing."}

Sampling methods often struggle with slow or non-convergence when dealing with multiple modes or flat regions of the target distributions. This paper develops a novel Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach for non-identified models, leveraging the knowledge of observationally equivalent sets of parameters, and highlights an important role that identification plays in modern Bayesian analysis. We show that our proposal overcomes the issues of being trapped in a local mode and achieves a faster rate of convergence than the existing MCMC techniques including random walk Metropolis-Hastings and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. The gain in the speed of convergence is more significant as the dimension or cardinality of the identified sets increases. Simulation studies show its superior performance compared to other popular computational methods including Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and sequential Monte Carlo. We also demonstrate that our method uncovers non-trivial modes in the target distribution in a structural vector moving-average (SVMA) application."}

We develop an overlapping-generations model of a security dilemma with persistent group types (normal vs bad), one-sided private signaling by the current old to the current young, and noisy private memory of the last encounter. We characterize a stationary equilibrium in which, for an intermediate band of signal costs, normal old agents mix on sending a costly reassurance only after an alarming private history; the signal is kept marginally persuasive by endogenous receiver cutoffs and strategic mimicking by bad types. Signaling strictly reduces the hazard of conflict onset; conditional on onset, duration is unchanged in the private model but increases once a small probability of publicity (leaks) creates a public record of failed reconciliation. With publicity, play generically absorbs in a peace trap or a conflict trap. We discuss welfare and policy: when to prefer back-channels versus public pledges."}

Current frameworks tend to prescribe monolithic solutions that are not only prohibitively computationally complex with a scaling cost of $O(n^2)$ but simply do not offer Byzantine fault tolerance. The proposed hierarchical framework presented in this paper tries to eliminate such trade-offs by stratifying a three-layered architecture. We spread the intelligence into three layers: an immediate collision avoiding local layer running on dense graph attention with latency of $<10 ms$, a regional layer using sparse attention with $O(nk)$ computational complexity and asynchronous federated learning with coordinate-wise trimmed mean aggregation, and lastly, a global layer using a lightweight Hashgraph-inspired protocol. We have proposed an adaptive differential privacy mechanism, wherein the noise level $(ε\\in [0.1, 1.0])$ is dynamically reduced based on an evaluation of the measured real-time threat that in turn maximized the privacy-utility tradeoff. Through the use of Distributed Hash Table (DHT)-based lightweight audit logging instead of heavyweight blockchain consensus, the median cost of getting a $95^{th}$ percentile decision within 50ms is observed across all tested swarm sizes. This architecture provides a scalable scenario of 500 UAVs with a collision rate of $< 2.0\\%$ and the Byzantine fault tolerance of $f < n/3$."}

Recent works show that pre-trained dynamic graph neural networks (GNNs) can achieve excellent performance. However, existing methods by fine-tuning node representations at large scales demand significant computational resources. Additionally, the long-tail distribution of degrees leads to insufficient representations for nodes with sparse interactions, posing challenges for efficient fine-tuning. To address these issues, we introduce GraphSASA, a novel method for efficient fine-tuning in dynamic recommendation systems. GraphSASA employs test-time augmentation by leveraging the similarity of node representation distributions during hierarchical graph aggregation, which enhances node representations. Then it applies singular value decomposition, freezing the original vector matrix while focusing fine-tuning on the derived singular value matrices, which reduces the parameter burden of fine-tuning and improves the fine-tuning adaptability. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three large-scale datasets."}

It develops an integrated analytical framework combining econometrics, machine learning, and behavioural modelling. CBDC adoption probabilities are estimated using XGBoost and logistic regression models trained on behavioural and macro-financial indicators rather than survey data. Liquidity stress simulations assess how banks would respond to deposit withdrawals resulting from CBDC adoption, while VAR, MSVAR, and SVAR models capture the macro-financial transmission of liquidity shocks into credit contraction and changes in monetary conditions. The findings indicate that CBDC uptake (co-circulating Digital RON and Digital EUR) would be moderate at issuance, amounting to around EUR 1 billion, primarily driven by digital readiness and trust in the central bank. The study concludes that a non-remunerated, capped CBDC, designed primarily as a means of payment rather than a store of value, can be introduced without compromising financial stability. In dual currency economies, differentiated holding limits for domestic and foreign digital currencies (e.g., Digital RON versus Digital Euro) are crucial to prevent uncontrolled euroisation and preserve monetary sovereignty. A prudent design with moderate caps, non remuneration, and macroprudential coordination can transform CBDC into a digital liquidity buffer and a complementary monetary policy instrument that enhances resilience and inclusion rather than destabilising the financial system."}

The method bridges the simulated method of moments (SMM) and maximum-likelihood estimation by embedding a flexible discriminator, implemented as a neural network, that adaptively selects the most informative features of the data. Applying this approach to the model of De Nardi, French, and Jones (2010) with AHEAD data, we show that including gender and health histories in the discriminator improves identification and precision of bequests motives. The resulting estimates reveal that bequest motives explain between $13\\%$ and $19\\%$ percent of late-life savings across all permanent-income quintiles, not only among the rich. The adversarial estimator precisely disentangles bequest motives from precautionary savings motives. These findings suggest that heterogeneity in health-related survival expectations is another important source of identifying variation to distinguishing bequest and precautionary saving motives."}

Indeed, neuromorphic engineering could provide low-latency, low-energy and adaptive control systems in the form of spiking neural networks (SNNs) exploiting spike-based control and communication. However, systematic methods for designing and analyzing neuron-inspired spiking controllers are currently lacking. This paper presents a new systematic approach for stabilizing linear time-invariant (LTI) systems using SNN-based controllers, designed as a network of integrate-and-fire neurons, whose input is the measured output from the plant and generating spiking control signals. The new approach consists of a two-step emulation-based design procedure. In the first step, we establish conditions on the neuron parameters to ensure that the spiking signal generated by a pair of neurons emulates any continuous-time signal input to the neurons with arbitrary accuracy in terms of a special metric for spiky signals. In the second step, we propose a novel stability notion, called integral spiking-input-to-state stability (iSISS) building on this special metric. We prove that an asymptotically stable LTI system has this iSISS property. By combining these steps, a certifiable practical stability property of the closed-loop system can be established. Generalizations are discussed and the effectiveness of the approach is illustrated in a numerical case study."}

CLINB relies on a dataset of real users' questions and evaluation rubrics curated by leading climate scientists. We implement and validate a model-based evaluation process and evaluate several frontier models. Our findings reveal a critical dichotomy. Frontier models demonstrate remarkable knowledge synthesis capabilities, often exhibiting PhD-level understanding and presentation quality. They outperform \"hybrid\" answers curated by domain experts assisted by weaker models. However, this performance is countered by failures in grounding. The quality of evidence varies, with substantial hallucination rates for references and images.

Techniques such as SHAP, LIME, Integrated Gradients, saliency mapping, and attention visualisation are mapped to corresponding DCB artefacts. ECSF reframes explainability as a core element of clinical-safety assurance, bridging deterministic risk governance with the probabilistic behaviour of AI and supporting alignment with GMLP, the EU AI Act, and NHS AI Assurance principles."}

We introduce the perception gap index, a graph-based measure that quantifies local-global opinion divergence, which can be viewed as a generalization of the majority illusion to continuous settings. Using techniques from spectral graph theory, we demonstrate that higher connectivity makes networks more resilient to perception distortion. Our analysis of stochastic block models, however, shows that pronounced community structure increases vulnerability. We also study the problem of minimizing the perception gap via link recommendation with a fixed budget. We prove that this problem does not admit a polynomial-time algorithm for any bounded approximation ratio, unless P = NP. However, we propose a collection of efficient heuristic methods that have been demonstrated to produce near-optimal solutions on real-world network data."}

We show how to use them to solve Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) explicitly discretized on a computational stencil. From this point of view, the QPU serves as a sampling accelerator. Each micro-kernel consumes only stencil inputs (neighbor values and coefficients), runs a shallow parameterized circuit, and reports the sample mean of a readout rule. The resource footprint in qubits and depth is fixed and independent of the global grid. This makes micro-kernels easy to orchestrate from a classical host and to parallelize across grid points. We present two realizations. The Bernoulli micro-kernel targets convex-sum stencils by encoding values as single-qubit probabilities with shot allocation proportional to stencil weights. The branching micro-kernel prepares a selector over stencil branches and applies addressed rotations to a single readout qubit. In contrast to monolithic quantum PDE solvers that encode the full space-time problem in one deep circuit, our approach keeps the classical time loop and offloads only local updates. Batching and in-circuit fusion amortize submission and readout overheads. We test and validate the QPU micro-kernel method on two PDEs commonly arising in scientific computing: the Heat and viscous Burgers' equations. On noiseless quantum circuit simulators, accuracy improves as the number of samples increases. On the IBM Brisbane quantum computer, single-step diffusion tests show lower errors for the Bernoulli realization than for branching at equal shot budgets, with QPU micro-kernel execution dominating the wall time."}

Using two canonical experiments in behavioural economics, the ultimatum game and a gambling game, we elicit decisions from two state of the art models, Google Gemma7B and Qwen, under neutral and gender conditioned prompts. We estimate parameters of inequity aversion and loss-aversion and compare them with human benchmarks.

Indeed, neuromorphic engineering could provide low-latency, low-energy and adaptive control systems in the form of spiking neural networks (SNNs) exploiting spike-based control and communication. However, systematic methods for designing and analyzing neuron-inspired spiking controllers are currently lacking. This paper presents a new systematic approach for stabilizing linear time-invariant (LTI) systems using SNN-based controllers, designed as a network of integrate-and-fire neurons, whose input is the measured output from the plant and generating spiking control signals. The new approach consists of a two-step emulation-based design procedure. In the first step, we establish conditions on the neuron parameters to ensure that the spiking signal generated by a pair of neurons emulates any continuous-time signal input to the neurons with arbitrary accuracy in terms of a special metric for spiky signals. In the second step, we propose a novel stability notion, called integral spiking-input-to-state stability (iSISS) building on this special metric. We prove that an asymptotically stable LTI system has this iSISS property. By combining these steps, a certifiable practical stability property of the closed-loop system can be established. Generalizations are discussed and the effectiveness of the approach is illustrated in a numerical case study."}

Existing Control Barrier Function (CBF) frameworks, such as High-Order CBFs (HOCBFs), effectively guarantee safety in continuous time but may become unsafe when executed under zero-order-hold (ZOH) controllers due to inter-sampling effects. Moreover, they do not explicitly handle finite-time reach-and-remain requirements or multiple simultaneous constraints, which often lead to conflicts between safety and reach-and-remain objectives, resulting in feasibility issues during control synthesis. This paper introduces Sampling-Aware Control Barrier Functions (SACBFs), a unified framework that accounts for sampling effects and high relative-degree constraints by estimating and incorporating Taylor-based upper bounds on barrier evolution between sampling instants. The proposed method guarantees continuous-time forward invariance of safety and finite-time reach-and-remain sets under ZOH control. To further improve feasibility, a relaxed variant (r-SACBF) introduces slack variables for handling multiple constraints realized through time-varying CBFs. Simulation studies on a unicycle robot demonstrate that SACBFs achieve safe and feasible performance in scenarios where traditional HOCBF methods fail."}

Manually designing questions is time-consuming and often fails to meet diverse learning needs, making automated question generation a crucial approach to reduce teachers' workload and improve the scalability of educational resources. However, most existing question generation methods rely on single-agent or rule-based pipelines, which still produce questions with unstable quality, limited diversity, and insufficient alignment with educational goals. To address these challenges, we propose EduAgentQG, a multi-agent collaborative framework for generating high-quality and diverse personalized questions. The framework consists of five specialized agents and operates through an iterative feedback loop: the Planner generates structured design plans and multiple question directions to enhance diversity; the Writer produces candidate questions based on the plan and optimizes their quality and diversity using feedback from the Solver and Educator; the Solver and Educator perform binary scoring across multiple evaluation dimensions and feed the evaluation results back to the Writer; the Checker conducts final verification, including answer correctness and clarity, ensuring alignment with educational goals. Through this multi-agent collaboration and iterative feedback loop, EduAgentQG generates questions that are both high-quality and diverse, while maintaining consistency with educational objectives. Experiments on two mathematics question datasets demonstrate that EduAgentQG outperforms existing single-agent and multi-agent methods in terms of question diversity, goal consistency, and overall quality."}

We employ a geometric approach using a 3D Piece-Wise Clothoid-based model to reconstruct the configuration taken by a tendril after mechanical rubbing. The reconstruction shows high robustness and reliability with an accuracy of R2 > 0.99. This method demonstrates distinct advantages over deep learning-based approaches, including reduced data requirements, lower computational costs, and interpretability. Our analysis reveals higher responsiveness in the apical segment of tendrils, which might correspond to higher sensitivity and tissue flexibility in that region of the organs.

In view of this, we propose Segmented Exponent Alignment (SEA) and Dynamic Wordline Activation (DWA) strategies. SEA exploits the observation that input exponents are often clustered around zero or within a narrow range. By segmenting the exponent space and aligning mantissas accordingly, SEA eliminates the need for maximum exponent detection and reduces input mantissa shifting, and thus reduces the processing latency. DWA further reduces latency and maintains accuracy by activating wordlines based on the exponent segments defined by SEA. Simulation results demonstrate that, when compared with conventional comparison tree based maximum exponent alignment method, our approach saves 63.8\\% power consumption, and achieves a 40.87\\% delay reduction on the VGG16-CIFAR10 benchmark."}

Source apportionment using least squares-based non-negative matrix factorization is non-unique and often does not scale. A recent geometric source apportionment framework focuses inference on the source attribution matrix, which is shown to remain identifiable even when the factorization is not. Recognizing that the method scales with and benefits from large data volumes, we use this geometric method to analyze 451,946 one-minute air sensor records from Curtis Bay (Baltimore, USA), collected from October 21, 2022 to June 16, 2023, covering size-resolved particulate matter (PM), black carbon (BC), carbon monoxide (CO), nitric oxide (NO), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). The analysis identifies three stable sources. Source 1 explains > 70% of fine and coarse PM and ~30% of BC. Source 2 dominates CO and contributes ~70% of BC, NO, and NO2. Source 3 is specific to the larger PM fractions, PM10 to PM40. Regression analyses show Source 1 and Source 3 rise during bulldozer activity at a nearby coal terminal and under winds from the terminal, indicating a direct coal terminal influence, while Source 2 exhibits diurnal patterns consistent with traffic. A case-study on the day with a known bulldozer incident at the coal terminal further confirms the association of terminal activities with Sources 1 and 3. The results are stable under sensitivity analyses. The analysis demonstrates that geometric source apportionment, paired with high temporal resolution data from multi-pollutant air sensor networks, delivers scalable and reliable evidence to inform mitigation strategies."}

Existing methods in the literature provide only sufficient conditions and might ignore real-world inconsistencies in control actions. In this paper, we introduce a trajectory-alignment-based definition of the minimum forecast horizon and propose an algorithm that identifies the minimum planning horizon for which all rolling-horizon control decisions match those of the full-horizon global optimization. Using real price data from the bidding zone DK1 in Denmark of the Nord Pool day-ahead market and a realistic ESS model, we illustrate that $60$ hours of forecast horizon allows us to exactly simulate the global control sequence and economic outcomes. In addition, we illustrate that under other parameter configurations, no forecast horizon ensures full convergence, demonstrating the sensitivity of the existence of a forecast horizon to various parameters. Our findings provide an operationally significant framework for minimum forecast horizon detection in storage scheduling and pave the way for the analytical description of this important planning measure."}

Using high-frequency sales and rental data and a combination of propensity score matching difference-in-differences, geographic regression discontinuity, and event study designs, the analysis identifies distinct short-run adjustment patterns triggered by the policy announcement. Housing prices inside the toll zone fell by about 3.3% and rents by 3%, with the sharpest declines occurring immediately after the announcement. These effects weakened over time, and price resilience emerged among premium properties, indicating early market sorting and growing segmentation. The Geo-RDD results show a clear boundary penalty, with properties just inside the cordon experiencing more pronounced declines than otherwise similar properties just outside. Renters and lower-value segments were more exposed to early adjustment pressures, while implementation-stage effects were limited. The findings suggest that congestion pricing can reshape urban space not only by altering mobility incentives but also by redistributing access and opportunity. Equity-oriented design that includes early-stage support for boundary neighborhoods and renters, along with reinvestment of revenues into untolled transit access, is important for ensuring that the benefits of congestion pricing are shared rather than concentrated."}

To address these challenges, we propose ExpertAD, a novel framework that enhances the performance of ADS with Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture. We introduce a Perception Adapter (PA) to amplify task-critical features, ensuring contextually relevant scene understanding, and a Mixture of Sparse Experts (MoSE) to minimize task interference during prediction, allowing for effective and efficient planning.

Existing solutions either require retraining the entire model, add significant computational costs, or miss the root causes of why these hallucinations occur in the first place.\n  We present CausalGuard, a new approach that combines causal reasoning with symbolic logic to catch and prevent hallucinations as they happen. Unlike previous methods that only check outputs after generation, our system understands the causal chain that leads to false statements and intervenes early in the process. CausalGuard works through two complementary paths: one that traces causal relationships between what the model knows and what it generates, and another that checks logical consistency using automated reasoning.\n  Testing across twelve different benchmarks, we found that CausalGuard correctly identifies hallucinations 89.3\\% of the time while missing only 8.3\\% of actual hallucinations. More importantly, it reduces false claims by nearly 80\\% while keeping responses natural and helpful. The system performs especially well on complex reasoning tasks where multiple steps of logic are required. Because CausalGuard shows its reasoning process, it works well in sensitive areas like medical diagnosis or financial analysis where understanding why a decision was made matters as much as the decision itself."}

The unprecedented scale and reliance on information disseminated through these systems substantially expand the scope of information-based influence that can both enable and undermine sound decision-making. Consequently, understanding and protecting decision-making today faces growing challenges, as individuals and organizations must navigate evolving opportunities and information-based threats across varied domains and information environments. While these risks are widely recognized, research remains fragmented: work evaluating information-based threat phenomena has progressed largely in isolation from foundational studies of human information processing. In this review, we synthesize insights from both domains to identify shared cognitive mechanisms that mediate vulnerability to information-based threats and shape behavioral outcomes. Finally, we outline directions for future research aimed at integrating these perspectives, emphasizing the importance of such integration for mitigating human vulnerabilities and aligning human-machine representations."}

While prior research has focused largely on network structures and tipping point identification, it provides limited tools for automatically generating content tailored for virality within a specific audience. To fill this gap, we propose the novel task of DOCG and introduce an information enhancement algorithm for generating content optimized for diffusion. Our method includes an influence indicator that enables content-level diffusion assessment without requiring access to network topology, and an information editor that employs reinforcement learning to explore interpretable editing strategies. The editor leverages generative models to produce semantically faithful, audience-aware textual or visual content. Experiments on real-world social media datasets and user study demonstrate that our approach significantly improves diffusion effectiveness while preserving the core semantics of the original content."}

This work presents PolicyBot, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system designed to answer user queries over policy documents with a focus on transparency and reproducibility. The system combines domain-specific semantic chunking, multilingual dense embeddings, multi-stage retrieval with reranking, and source-aware generation to provide responses grounded in the original documents. We implemented citation tracing to reduce hallucinations and improve user trust, and evaluated alternative retrieval and generation configurations to identify effective design choices. The end-to-end pipeline is built entirely with open-source tools, enabling easy adaptation to other domains requiring document-grounded question answering.

Using high-frequency sales and rental data and a combination of propensity score matching difference-in-differences, geographic regression discontinuity, and event study designs, the analysis identifies distinct short-run adjustment patterns triggered by the policy announcement. Housing prices inside the toll zone fell by about 3.3% and rents by 3%, with the sharpest declines occurring immediately after the announcement. These effects weakened over time, and price resilience emerged among premium properties, indicating early market sorting and growing segmentation. The Geo-RDD results show a clear boundary penalty, with properties just inside the cordon experiencing more pronounced declines than otherwise similar properties just outside. Renters and lower-value segments were more exposed to early adjustment pressures, while implementation-stage effects were limited. The findings suggest that congestion pricing can reshape urban space not only by altering mobility incentives but also by redistributing access and opportunity. Equity-oriented design that includes early-stage support for boundary neighborhoods and renters, along with reinvestment of revenues into untolled transit access, is important for ensuring that the benefits of congestion pricing are shared rather than concentrated."}

An important problem of model predictive control of ESSs is identifying the minimum forecast horizon needed to exactly simulate the globally optimal control trajectory. Existing methods in the literature provide only sufficient conditions and might ignore real-world inconsistencies in control actions. In this paper, we introduce a trajectory-alignment-based definition of the minimum forecast horizon and propose an algorithm that identifies the minimum planning horizon for which all rolling-horizon control decisions match those of the full-horizon global optimization. Using real price data from the bidding zone DK1 in Denmark of the Nord Pool day-ahead market and a realistic ESS model, we illustrate that $60$ hours of forecast horizon allows us to exactly simulate the global control sequence and economic outcomes. In addition, we illustrate that under other parameter configurations, no forecast horizon ensures full convergence, demonstrating the sensitivity of the existence of a forecast horizon to various parameters. Our findings provide an operationally significant framework for minimum forecast horizon detection in storage scheduling and pave the way for the analytical description of this important planning measure."}

Despite the severity of this problem, more comprehensive quantitative scientific studies need to be conducted to elucidate the sequence and dynamics of these occurrences. In response, this study introduces a spatio-temporal statistical method designed to uncover the patterns of fatalities associated with violent events in Ethiopia. The research employs a two-part zero-inflated Bayesian generalized additive mixed model, which integrates a spatio-temporal component to map the fatality patterns across Ethiopian regions. The dataset utilized originates from the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project, covering fatality counts related to violent events from 1997 to 2022. The analysis revealed that nine out of thirteen administrative regions exhibited a probability greater than 0.6 for fatality occurrence due to violent events, with five regions surpassing a 0.7 probability threshold. These five regions include Benishangul Gumz, Gambela, Oromia, Somali, and the South West Ethiopian People's Region. Notably, the Tigray region displayed the highest probability (0.558) of experiencing more than 20 deaths per violent event, followed by the Benishangul Gumz region with a probability of 0.306. Encouragingly, the findings also indicate an average decline in fatalities per violent event over time. Specifically, the probability of more than 20 deaths per event was 0.401 in 2020, which decreased to 0.148 by 2022. These insights are invaluable for the government, policymakers, political leaders, and traditional or religious authorities in Ethiopia, enabling them to make informed, strategic decisions to mitigate and ultimately prevent violence-related fatalities in the country."}

To address this, we develop a parameterized physics-informed neural network (P-PINNSPM) over the key aging-related parameter space for a single particle model. The model can accurately predict internal battery variables across the parameter space and identifies internal parameters in about 30 seconds-achieving a 47x speedup over the finite volume method-while maintaining high accuracy. These parameters improve the battery state-of-health (SOH) estimation accuracy by at least 60.61%, compared to models without parameter incorporation. Moreover, they enable extrapolation to unseen SOH levels and support robust estimation across diverse charging profiles and operating conditions. Our results demonstrate the strong potential of physics-informed machine learning to advance real-time, data-efficient, and physics-aware battery management systems."}

Drawing on 5.65 million scientific articles published from 2021 to 2024, we compare GenAI-assisted and non-assisted publications from authors in non-English-speaking countries. Using text embeddings derived from a pretrained large language model (SciBERT), we measure each publication's linguistic similarity to a benchmark of scientific writing from U.S.-based authors and track stylistic convergence over time. We find significant and growing convergence for GenAI-assisted publications after the release of ChatGPT in late 2022. The effect is strongest for domestic coauthor teams from countries linguistically distant from English. These findings provide large-scale evidence that GenAI is beginning to reshape global science communication by reducing language barriers in research."}

We implement and validate a model-based evaluation process and evaluate several frontier models. Our findings reveal a critical dichotomy. Frontier models demonstrate remarkable knowledge synthesis capabilities, often exhibiting PhD-level understanding and presentation quality. They outperform \"hybrid\" answers curated by domain experts assisted by weaker models. However, this performance is countered by failures in grounding. The quality of evidence varies, with substantial hallucination rates for references and images.

VALOR integrates layered prompt analysis with human-aligned value reasoning: a multi-level NSFW detector filters lexical and semantic risks; a cultural value alignment module identifies violations of social norms, legality, and representational ethics; and an intention disambiguator detects subtle or indirect unsafe implications. When unsafe content is detected, prompts are selectively rewritten by a large language model under dynamic, role-specific instructions designed to preserve user intent while enforcing alignment. If the generated image still fails a safety check, VALOR optionally performs a stylistic regeneration to steer the output toward a safer visual domain without altering core semantics. Experiments across adversarial, ambiguous, and value-sensitive prompts show that VALOR significantly reduces unsafe outputs by up to 100.00% while preserving prompt usefulness and creativity. These results highlight VALOR as a scalable and effective approach for deploying safe, aligned, and helpful image generation systems in open-world settings."}

LAMP follows a Think-Speak-Decide pipeline: (1) Think interprets numerical observations to extract short-term shocks and long-term trends, caching high-value reasoning trajectories; (2) Speak crafts and exchanges strategic messages based on reasoning, updating beliefs by parsing peer communications; and (3) Decide fuses numerical data, reasoning, and reflections into a MARL policy to optimize language-augmented decision-making.

Motion capture (MoCap) systems are frequently used to generate ground truth annotations for human poses when training models with data from wearable or ambient sensors, and have been shown to be effective to synthesize data in these modalities. However, the representation of older adults, an increasingly important demographic in healthcare, in existing MoCap locomotion datasets has not been thoroughly examined. This work surveyed 41 publicly available datasets, identifying eight that include older adult motions and four that contain motions performed by younger actors annotated as old style. Older adults represent a small portion of participants overall, and few datasets provide full-body motion data for this group. To assess the fidelity of old-style walking motions, quantitative metrics are introduced, defining high fidelity as the ability to capture age-related differences relative to normative walking. Using gait parameters that are age-sensitive, robust to noise, and resilient to data scarcity, we found that old-style walking motions often exhibit overly controlled patterns and fail to faithfully characterize aging. These findings highlight the need for improved representation of older adults in motion datasets and establish a method to quantitatively evaluate the quality of old-style walking motions."}

This \"hallucination\" problem has become a major barrier to using these models where accuracy matters most. Existing solutions either require retraining the entire model, add significant computational costs, or miss the root causes of why these hallucinations occur in the first place.\n  We present CausalGuard, a new approach that combines causal reasoning with symbolic logic to catch and prevent hallucinations as they happen. Unlike previous methods that only check outputs after generation, our system understands the causal chain that leads to false statements and intervenes early in the process. CausalGuard works through two complementary paths: one that traces causal relationships between what the model knows and what it generates, and another that checks logical consistency using automated reasoning.\n  Testing across twelve different benchmarks, we found that CausalGuard correctly identifies hallucinations 89.3\\% of the time while missing only 8.3\\% of actual hallucinations. More importantly, it reduces false claims by nearly 80\\% while keeping responses natural and helpful. The system performs especially well on complex reasoning tasks where multiple steps of logic are required. Because CausalGuard shows its reasoning process, it works well in sensitive areas like medical diagnosis or financial analysis where understanding why a decision was made matters as much as the decision itself."}

Fifty-four participants completed structured question-answering tasks, allowing us to measure accuracy, response time, and perceived workload (NASA-TLX). We used mixed-effects regression models to find: Nightingale's diagram remained consistently effective across versions, achieving near-ceiling accuracy and low workload; Playfair's dual-axis redesign underperformed relative to both its historical and alternative versions; and Minard's map showed large accuracy gains under redesign but continued to impose high workload and long response times. These results demonstrate that some nineteenth-century designs remain effective, others degrade under certain modernizations, and some benefit from careful redesign. The findings indicate how perceptual encoding choices, task alignment, and cognitive load determine whether historical charts survive or require adaptation for contemporary use."}

Effective target tracking demands balancing exploration for undetected or lost targets with following the motion of detected but uncertain ones. We generate a demonstration dataset from three expert planners including frontier-based exploration, an uncertainty-based hybrid planner switching between frontier-based exploration and RRT* tracking based on target uncertainty, and a time-based hybrid planner switching between exploration and tracking based on target detection time. We design a control policy utilizing a vision transformer for egocentric map tokenization and an attention mechanism to integrate variable target estimates represented by Gaussian densities. Trained as a diffusion model, the policy learns to generate multi-modal action sequences through a denoising process. Evaluations demonstrate MATT-Diff's superior tracking performance against expert and behavior cloning baselines across multiple target motions, empirically validating its advantages in target tracking."}

These complexities present significant challenges for automated valuation models (AVMs), which are increasingly used to provide objective assessments for property taxation and mortgage financing. The challenge of obtaining accurate and objective valuations for properties at a country level, and not just within major cities, is further compounded by the presence of multiple localised submarkets-spanning urban, suburban, and rural contexts-where property features contribute differently to value. Existing AVMs often struggle in such settings: traditional hedonic regression models lack the flexibility to capture spatial variation, while advanced machine learning approaches demand extensive datasets that are rarely available. In this article, we address these limitations by developing a robust statistical framework for property valuation in the Irish housing market. We segment the country into six submarkets encompassing cities, large towns, and rural areas, and employ a generalized additive model that captures non-linear effects of property characteristics while allowing feature contributions to vary across submarkets. Our approach outperforms both machine learning-based and traditional hedonic regression models, particularly in data-sparse regions. In out-of-sample validation, our model achieves R-squared values of 0.70, 0.84, and 0.83 for rural areas, towns, and Dublin, respectively, compared to 0.52, 0.71, and 0.82 from a random forest benchmark. Furthermore, the temporal dynamics of our model align closely with reported inflation figures for the study period, providing additional validation of its accuracy."}

After one intruder breaches or is captured, the next appears randomly on a fixed circle surrounding the target. Therefore, the defender's final position in one game becomes its starting position for the next. We divide an intruder-defender engagement into two phases, partial information and full information, depending on the information available to the players.

Through a principles-first approach to analyze screw performance, it was found that certain parameters are dominant in their impact on performance. Depending on the media, derived parameters inspired from optimizing heat sink design help categorize performance within the dominant design parameters. Our results provide specific insights into screw shell design and adaptive locomotion strategies to enhance the performance of screw-based propulsion systems for versatile amphibious applications."}

Yet, the concept of intelligence remains elusive- lacking a stable definition and failing to predict performance on practical tasks such as question answering, summarization, or coding. Optimizing for such benchmarks risks misaligning evaluation with real-world utility. Our perspective is that evaluation should be grounded in generality rather than abstract notions of intelligence. We identify three assumptions that often underpin intelligence-focused evaluation: generality, stability, and realism. Through conceptual and formal analysis, we show that only generality withstands conceptual and empirical scrutiny. Intelligence is not what enables generality; generality is best understood as a multitask learning problem that directly links evaluation to measurable performance breadth and reliability. This perspective reframes how progress in AI should be assessed and proposes generality as a more stable foundation for evaluating capability across diverse and evolving tasks."}

Current frameworks tend to prescribe monolithic solutions that are not only prohibitively computationally complex with a scaling cost of $O(n^2)$ but simply do not offer Byzantine fault tolerance. The proposed hierarchical framework presented in this paper tries to eliminate such trade-offs by stratifying a three-layered architecture. We spread the intelligence into three layers: an immediate collision avoiding local layer running on dense graph attention with latency of $<10 ms$, a regional layer using sparse attention with $O(nk)$ computational complexity and asynchronous federated learning with coordinate-wise trimmed mean aggregation, and lastly, a global layer using a lightweight Hashgraph-inspired protocol. We have proposed an adaptive differential privacy mechanism, wherein the noise level $(ε\\in [0.1, 1.0])$ is dynamically reduced based on an evaluation of the measured real-time threat that in turn maximized the privacy-utility tradeoff. Through the use of Distributed Hash Table (DHT)-based lightweight audit logging instead of heavyweight blockchain consensus, the median cost of getting a $95^{th}$ percentile decision within 50ms is observed across all tested swarm sizes. This architecture provides a scalable scenario of 500 UAVs with a collision rate of $< 2.0\\%$ and the Byzantine fault tolerance of $f < n/3$."}

The intruders' objective is to breach the target perimeter without being captured by the defender, while the defender's goal is to capture as many intruders as possible. After one intruder breaches or is captured, the next appears randomly on a fixed circle surrounding the target. Therefore, the defender's final position in one game becomes its starting position for the next. We divide an intruder-defender engagement into two phases, partial information and full information, depending on the information available to the players. We address the capturability of an intruder by the defender using the notions of Dubins path and guarding arc. We quantify the percentage of capture for both finite and infinite sequences of incoming intruders.

Normalized entropy maps entropy values to the [0,1] interval through standardization, accurately capturing relative changes in data complexity. By utilizing a sliding window to compute normalized entropy, this approach transforms the challenge of detecting change points in complex time series, arising from variations in scale, distribution, and diversity, into the task of identifying significant features within the normalized entropy sequence, thereby avoiding interference from parametric assumptions and effectively highlighting distributional shifts. Experimental results show that normalized entropy exhibits significant numerical fluctuation characteristics and patterns near change points across various distributions and parameter combinations. The average deviation between fluctuation moments and actual change points is only 2.4% of the sliding window size, demonstrating strong adaptability. This paper provides theoretical support for change-point detection in complex data environments and lays a methodological foundation for precise and automated detection based on normalized entropy as a fundamental metric."}

In this increasingly competitive environment, many small and medium sized enterprises struggle to maintain customer satisfaction as rivals deliver higher quality services at lower cost. This study addresses the absence of robust measurement systems for assessing service quality, a key factor underlying customer attrition, by proposing an integrated framework for evaluating satisfaction and identifying sources of dissatisfaction in computer services.\n  The framework combines core principles of Six Sigma with the SERVQUAL instrument within a structured DMAIC methodology (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control). SERVQUAL provides the service quality dimensions and gap analysis techniques, while Six Sigma supplies the data driven approach to measurement and improvement. The literature suggests limited prior work integrating Lean Six Sigma with SERVQUAL, and this study contributes by operationalizing that integration in a real world setting.\n  A case study of a computer services company was conducted to demonstrate feasibility and effectiveness. Satisfaction levels were quantified, and root causes of dissatisfaction were identified. The analysis revealed a low overall satisfaction level and five primary drivers of unmet customer requirements. Addressing these causes is expected to increase customer satisfaction, lower customer acquisition costs, and improve overall organizational performance."}

This is useful, e.g., for specifying and verifying desired system properties. While translating FOL into human-readable English is relatively straightforward, the inverse problem, converting NL to FOL (NL-FOL translation), has remained a longstanding challenge, for both humans and machines. Although the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) promised a breakthrough, recent literature provides contrasting results on their ability to perform NL-FOL translation. In this work, we provide a threefold contribution. First, we critically examine existing datasets and protocols for evaluating NL-FOL translation performance, revealing key limitations that may cause a misrepresentation of LLMs' actual capabilities. Second, to overcome these shortcomings, we propose a novel evaluation protocol explicitly designed to distinguish genuine semantic-level logical understanding from superficial pattern recognition, memorization, and dataset contamination. Third, using this new approach, we show that state-of-the-art, dialogue-oriented LLMs demonstrate strong NL-FOL translation skills and a genuine grasp of sentence-level logic, whereas embedding-centric models perform markedly worse."}

This is the extended version, including the technical appendix", "summary": "Precise estimation and uncertainty quantification for average crop yields are critical for agricultural monitoring and decision making. Existing data collection methods, such as crop cuts in randomly sampled fields at harvest time, are relatively time-consuming. Thus, we propose an approach based on prediction-powered inference (PPI) to supplement these crop cuts with less time-consuming field photos. After training a computer vision model to predict the ground truth crop cut yields from the photos, we learn a ``control function\" that recalibrates these predictions with the spatial coordinates of each field. This enables fields with photos but not crop cuts to be leveraged to improve the precision of zone-wide average yield estimates. Our control function is learned by training on a dataset of nearly 20,000 real crop cuts and photos of rice and maize fields in sub-Saharan Africa. To improve precision, we pool training observations across different zones within the same first-level subdivision of each country. Our final PPI-based point estimates of the average yield are provably asymptotically unbiased and cannot increase the asymptotic variance beyond that of the natural baseline estimator -- the sample average of the crop cuts -- as the number of fields grows. We also propose a novel bias-corrected and accelerated (BCa) bootstrap to construct accompanying confidence intervals. Even in zones with as few as 20 fields, the point estimates show significant empirical improvement over the baseline, increasing the effective sample size by as much as 73% for rice and by 12-23% for maize. The confidence intervals are accordingly shorter at minimal cost to empirical finite-sample coverage. This demonstrates the potential for relatively low-cost images to make area-based crop insurance more affordable and thus spur investment into sustainable agricultural practices."}

The data demonstrate near-universal AI adoption (95.7% with prior knowledge, 100% ChatGPT usage) primarily deployed through human-led sequences such as \"Think, Internet, ChatGPT, Further Processing\" (39.1%). However, this collaboration reveals a critical verification deficit that escalates with problem complexity. We empirically identify and quantify two systematic epistemic gaps: a belief-performance gap (up to +80.8 percentage points discrepancy between perceived and actual correctness) and a proof-belief gap (up to -16.8 percentage points between confidence and verification capability). These findings, derived from behavioral data and problem vignettes across complexity levels, indicate that the fundamental constraint on reliable AI-assisted work is solution validation rather than generation. The study concludes that educational and technological interventions must prioritize verification scaffolds (including assumption documentation protocols, adequacy criteria checklists, and triangulation procedures) to fortify the human role as critical validator in this new cognitive ecosystem."}

However, this makes the visual perception module a bottleneck, which constrains the overall capabilities of LVLMs. Conventional evaluation benchmarks, while rich in visual semantics, often contain unavoidable local shortcuts that can lead to an overestimation of models' perceptual abilities. Here, we introduce TopoPerception, a benchmark that leverages topological properties to rigorously evaluate the global visual perception capabilities of LVLMs across various granularities. Since topology depends on the global structure of an image and is invariant to local features, TopoPerception enables a shortcut-free assessment of global perception, fundamentally distinguishing it from semantically rich tasks. We evaluate state-of-the-art models on TopoPerception and find that even at the coarsest perceptual granularity, all models perform no better than random chance, indicating a profound inability to perceive global visual features. Notably, a consistent trend emerge within model families: more powerful models with stronger reasoning capabilities exhibit lower accuracy. This suggests that merely scaling up models is insufficient to address this deficit and may even exacerbate it. Progress may require new training paradigms or architectures. TopoPerception not only exposes a critical bottleneck in current LVLMs but also offers a lens and direction for improving their global visual perception.

To address these challenges, we propose EduAgentQG, a multi-agent collaborative framework for generating high-quality and diverse personalized questions. The framework consists of five specialized agents and operates through an iterative feedback loop: the Planner generates structured design plans and multiple question directions to enhance diversity; the Writer produces candidate questions based on the plan and optimizes their quality and diversity using feedback from the Solver and Educator; the Solver and Educator perform binary scoring across multiple evaluation dimensions and feed the evaluation results back to the Writer; the Checker conducts final verification, including answer correctness and clarity, ensuring alignment with educational goals. Through this multi-agent collaboration and iterative feedback loop, EduAgentQG generates questions that are both high-quality and diverse, while maintaining consistency with educational objectives.

To address this, we propose TacEleven, a generative framework for football open-play tactic discovery developed in close collaboration with domain experts from AJ Auxerre, designed to assist coaches and analysts in tactical decision-making. TacEleven consists of two core components: a language-controlled tactical generator that produces diverse tactical proposals, and a multimodal large language model-based tactical critic that selects the optimal proposal aligned with a high-level stylistic tactical instruction. The two components enables rapid exploration of tactical proposals and discovery of alternative open-play offensive tactics. We evaluate TacEleven across three tasks with progressive tactical complexity: counterfactual exploration, single-step discovery, and multi-step discovery, through both quantitative metrics and a questionnaire-based qualitative assessment. The results show that the TacEleven-discovered tactics exhibit strong realism and tactical creativity, with 52.50% of the multi-step tactical alternatives rated adoptable in real-world elite football scenarios, highlighting the framework's ability to rapidly generate numerous high-quality tactics for complex long-sequence open-play situations.

Therefore, an intelligent approach is urgently required to unify these DSMs and enable efficient coordination. To address this challenge, this paper proposes the ADN-Agent architecture, which leverages a general large language model (LLM) to coordinate multiple DSMs, enabling adaptive intent recognition, task decomposition, and DSM invocation. Within the ADN-Agent, we design a novel communication mechanism that provides a unified and flexible interface for diverse heterogeneous DSMs. Finally, for some language-intensive subtasks, we propose an automated training pipeline for fine-tuning small language models, thereby effectively enhancing the overall problem-solving capability of the system.

Each test pair uses for Y first total number of payments; and for each second test the number of other payments, which excludes income tax payments for profit and labour. All 5 requirements were met in every of the 6 tests, indicating a positive dependence. In addition, 4 confirmatory tests validate the methodology. The found relationship is noticeably stronger for the total number of tax payments. Findings indicate that taxpayers' time spent on tax, and thereby society's overall tax administrative costs, could be reduced by simplifying taxation processes, including tax collection and payments."}

Traditional sampling-based methods, such as RRT*, excel at generating collision-free paths but struggle to adapt to sudden changes without extensive replanning. Conversely, learning-based dynamical systems, such as the Stable Estimator of Dynamical Systems (SEDS), offer smooth, adaptive trajectory tracking but typically rely on pre-collected demonstration data, limiting their generalization to novel scenarios. This paper introduces Sampling-Based Adaptive Motion Planning (SBAMP), a novel framework that overcomes these limitations by integrating RRT* for global path planning with a SEDS-based local controller for continuous, adaptive trajectory adjustment. Our approach requires no pre-trained datasets and ensures smooth transitions between planned waypoints, maintaining stability through Lyapunov-based guarantees. We validate SBAMP in both simulated environments and real hardware using the RoboRacer platform, demonstrating superior performance in dynamic obstacle scenarios, rapid recovery from perturbations, and robust handling of sharp turns. Experimental results highlight SBAMP's ability to adapt in real time without sacrificing global path optimality, providing a scalable solution for dynamic, unstructured environments."}

Although climbing plants have been studied for a long time, extracting information regarding the relationship between the temporal shape change, the event that triggers it, and the contact location is still challenging. To help build this relation, we propose an image-based method by which it is possible to analyze shape changes over time in tendrils when mechano-stimulated in different portions of their body. We employ a geometric approach using a 3D Piece-Wise Clothoid-based model to reconstruct the configuration taken by a tendril after mechanical rubbing. The reconstruction shows high robustness and reliability with an accuracy of R2 > 0.99. This method demonstrates distinct advantages over deep learning-based approaches, including reduced data requirements, lower computational costs, and interpretability. Our analysis reveals higher responsiveness in the apical segment of tendrils, which might correspond to higher sensitivity and tissue flexibility in that region of the organs. Our study provides a methodology for gaining new insights into plant biomechanics and offers a foundation for designing and developing novel intelligent robotic systems inspired by climbing plants."}

Although expert engineers have developed numerous domain specific models (DSMs) to address distinct technical problems, mastering, integrating, and orchestrating these heterogeneous DSMs still entail considerable overhead for ADN operators. Therefore, an intelligent approach is urgently required to unify these DSMs and enable efficient coordination. To address this challenge, this paper proposes the ADN-Agent architecture, which leverages a general large language model (LLM) to coordinate multiple DSMs, enabling adaptive intent recognition, task decomposition, and DSM invocation. Within the ADN-Agent, we design a novel communication mechanism that provides a unified and flexible interface for diverse heterogeneous DSMs. Finally, for some language-intensive subtasks, we propose an automated training pipeline for fine-tuning small language models, thereby effectively enhancing the overall problem-solving capability of the system. Comprehensive comparisons and ablation experiments validate the efficacy of the proposed method and demonstrate that the ADN-Agent architecture outperforms existing LLM application paradigms."}

Using data from Germany, Spain, and France over 2015-2024 with two model classes (NARX and LEAR), we show that VSTs substantially reduce forecast errors, with gains of up to 14.6% for LEAR and 8.7% for NARX relative to untransformed benchmarks. The new parametrized asinh consistently outperforms its standard form, while rolling averaging across transformations delivers the most robust improvements, reducing errors by up to 17.7%.

Among its implementations in robotic manipulation, Diffusion Policy (DP), with its two variants DP-CNN (DP-C) and DP-Transformer (DP-T), is one of the most effective and widely adopted models, demonstrating the advantages of predicting continuous action sequences. However, both DP and other BC methods remain constrained by the scarcity of paired training data, and the internal mechanisms underlying DP's effectiveness remain insufficiently understood, leading to limited generalization and a lack of principled design in model development. In this work, we propose a decoupled training recipe that leverages nearly cost-free kinematics-generated trajectories as observation-free data to pretrain a general action head (action generator). The pretrained action head is then frozen and adapted to novel tasks through feature modulation. Our experiments demonstrate the feasibility of this approach in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios. As an additional benefit, decoupling improves training efficiency; for instance, DP-C achieves up to a 41% speedup. Furthermore, the confinement of task-specific knowledge to the conditioning components under decoupling, combined with the near-identical performance of DP-C in both normal and decoupled training, indicates that the action generation backbone plays a limited role in robotic manipulation. Motivated by this observation, we introduce DP-MLP, which replaces the 244M-parameter U-Net backbone of DP-C with only 4M parameters of simple MLP blocks, achieving a 83.9% faster training speed under normal training and 89.1% under decoupling."}

Unlearning addresses this challenge by selectively removing parametric knowledge from the trained models without retraining from scratch, which is critical for resource-intensive models such as Large Language Models (LLMs). Existing unlearning methods often degrade model performance by removing more information than necessary when attempting to ''forget'' specific data. We introduce Forgetting-MarI, an LLM unlearning framework that provably removes only the additional (marginal) information contributed by the data to be unlearned, while preserving the information supported by the data to be retained. By penalizing marginal information, our method yields an explicit upper bound on the unlearn dataset's residual influence in the trained models, providing provable undetectability. Extensive experiments confirm that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art unlearning methods, delivering reliable forgetting and better preserved general model performance across diverse benchmarks. This advancement represents an important step toward making AI systems more controllable and compliant with privacy and copyright regulations without compromising their effectiveness."}

Particularly, Neuro-Evolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) has been employed to generate dynamic gait parameters for the serpenoid gait function, which is implemented on the joint angles of the snake robot, thus controlling the robot on a desired dynamic path. NEAT is a single neural-network based evolutionary algorithm that is known to work extremely well when the input layer is of significantly higher dimension and the output layer is of a smaller size. For the planar snake robot, the input layer consists of the joint angles, link positions, head link position as well as obstacle positions in the vicinity. However, the output layer consists of only the frequency and offset angle of the serpenoid gait that control the speed and heading of the robot, respectively. Obstacle data from a LiDAR and the robot data from various sensors, along with the location of the end goal and time, are employed to parametrize a reward function that is maximized over iterations by selective propagation of superior neural networks. The implementation and experimental results showcase that the proposed approach is computationally efficient, especially for large environments with many obstacles. The proposed framework has been verified through a physics engine simulation study on PyBullet. The approach shows superior results to existing state-of-the-art methodologies and comparable results to the very recent CBRL approach with significantly lower computational overhead.

We examined four LLM models (GPT-4.1-Mini, Claude-3.5-Haiku, Gemini-1.5-Flash, Llama-3.3-70b) utilizing four different reasoning architectures (single-shot, embedding-controlled repetition, self-reflection, and multi-agent) on the RAVEN-FAIR dataset. Visual responses generated through a three-stage process (JSON extraction, LLM reasoning, and Tool Function) were evaluated using SSIM and LPIPS metrics; Chain-of-Thought scores and error types (semantic hallucination, numeric misperception) were analyzed. Results demonstrate that GPT-4.1-Mini consistently achieved the highest overall accuracy across all architectures, indicating a strong reasoning capability. While the multi-agent architecture occasionally altered semantic and numeric balance across models, these effects were not uniformly beneficial. Instead, each model exhibited distinct sensitivity patterns to architectural design, underscoring that reasoning effectiveness remains model-specific. Variations in response coverage further emerged as a confounding factor that complicates direct cross-architecture comparison. To estimate the upper-bound performance of each configuration, we report the best of five independent runs, representing a best-case scenario rather than an averaged outcome. This multi-run strategy aligns with recent recommendations, which emphasize that single-run evaluations are fragile and may lead to unreliable conclusions."}

Yet, the cost of adopting these AI services is understudied. Unlike traditional software licensing in which costs are predictable before usage, commercial LLM services charge per token of input text in addition to generated output tokens. Crucially, while firms can control the input, they have limited control over output tokens, which are effectively set by generation dynamics outside of business control. This research shows that subtle shifts in linguistic style can systematically alter the number of output tokens without impacting response quality. Using an experiment with OpenAI's API, this study reveals that non-polite prompts significantly increase output tokens leading to higher enterprise costs and additional revenue for OpenAI. Politeness is merely one instance of a broader phenomenon in which linguistic structure can drive unpredictable cost variation. For enterprises integrating LLM into applications, this unpredictability complicates budgeting and undermines transparency in business-to-business contexts. By demonstrating how end-user behavior links to enterprise costs through output token counts, this work highlights the opacity of current pricing models and calls for new approaches to ensure predictable and transparent adoption of LLM services."}

This approach formulates multi-agent coordination as a dynamic potential game, where the Nash equilibrium (NE) defines optimal control strategies across agents. To enable scalability and decentralized execution, we develop a Neighborhood-Dominated iterative Best Response (ND-iBR) scheme, built upon an iterated $\\varepsilon$-BR (i$\\varepsilon$-BR) process that guarantees finite-step convergence to an $\\varepsilon$-NE. This allows agents to compute strategies based on local interactions while ensuring theoretical convergence guarantees.

As a typical loosely coupled floating-base robot system, the supernumerary robotic leg (SRL) system is particularly susceptible to strong internal disturbances. To address the challenge posed by floating base, we investigated the dynamics model of the loosely coupled SRL and designed a hybrid position/force impedance controller to fit dynamic torque input. An efficient variable impedance control (VIC) method is developed to enhance human-robot interaction, particularly in scenarios involving external force disturbances. By dynamically adjusting impedance parameters, VIC improves the dynamic switching between rigidity and flexibility, so that it can adapt to unknown environmental disturbances in different states. An efficient real-time stability guaranteed impedance parameters generating network is specifically designed for the proposed SRL, to achieve shock mitigation and high rigidity supporting. Simulations and experiments validate the system's effectiveness, demonstrating its ability to maintain smooth signal transitions in flexible states while providing strong support forces in rigid states. This approach provides a practical solution for accommodating individual gait variations in interaction, and significantly advances the safety and adaptability of human-robot systems."}

Current defenses struggle to align outputs with human values without sacrificing generation quality or incurring high costs. To address these challenges, we introduce VALOR (Value-Aligned LLM-Overseen Rewriter), a modular, zero-shot agentic framework for safer and more helpful text-to-image generation. VALOR integrates layered prompt analysis with human-aligned value reasoning: a multi-level NSFW detector filters lexical and semantic risks; a cultural value alignment module identifies violations of social norms, legality, and representational ethics; and an intention disambiguator detects subtle or indirect unsafe implications. When unsafe content is detected, prompts are selectively rewritten by a large language model under dynamic, role-specific instructions designed to preserve user intent while enforcing alignment. If the generated image still fails a safety check, VALOR optionally performs a stylistic regeneration to steer the output toward a safer visual domain without altering core semantics. Experiments across adversarial, ambiguous, and value-sensitive prompts show that VALOR significantly reduces unsafe outputs by up to 100.00% while preserving prompt usefulness and creativity. These results highlight VALOR as a scalable and effective approach for deploying safe, aligned, and helpful image generation systems in open-world settings."}

In large or low-resource courses, instructors often lack the time, staffing, and bandwidth required to review and respond to every student reflection, creating gaps in support precisely where learners would benefit most. This paper presents a theory-grounded system that uses five coordinated role-based LLM agents (Evaluator, Equity Monitor, Metacognitive Coach, Aggregator, and Reflexion Reviewer) to score learner reflections with a shared rubric and to generate short, bias-aware, learner-facing comments. The agents first produce structured rubric scores, then check for potentially biased or exclusionary language, add metacognitive prompts that invite students to think about their own thinking, and finally compose a concise feedback message of at most 120 words. The system includes simple fairness checks that compare scoring error across lower and higher scoring learners, enabling instructors to monitor and bound disparities in accuracy. We evaluate the pipeline in a 12-session AI literacy program with adult learners. In this setting, the system produces rubric scores that approach expert-level agreement, and trained graders rate the AI-generated comments as helpful, empathetic, and well aligned with instructional goals. Taken together, these results show that multi-agent LLM systems can deliver equitable, high-quality formative feedback at a scale and speed that would be impossible for human graders alone. More broadly, the work points toward a future where feedback-rich learning becomes feasible for any course size or context, advancing long-standing goals of equity, access, and instructional capacity in education."}

Designing a general-purpose SRL device is inherently challenging, particularly when developing a unified theoretical framework that meets the diverse functional requirements of both upper and lower limbs. In this paper, we propose a multi-objective optimization (MOO) design theory that integrates grasping workspace similarity, walking workspace similarity, braced force for sit-to-stand (STS) movements, and overall mass and inertia. A geometric vector quantification method is developed using an ellipsoid to represent the workspace, aiming to reduce computational complexity and address quantification challenges. The ellipsoid envelope transforms workspace points into ellipsoid attributes, providing a parametric description of the workspace. Furthermore, the STS static braced force assesses the effectiveness of force transmission. The overall mass and inertia restricts excessive link length. To facilitate rapid and stable convergence of the model to high-dimensional irregular Pareto fronts, we introduce a multi-subpopulation correction firefly algorithm. This algorithm incorporates a strategy involving attractive and repulsive domains to effectively handle the MOO task. The optimized solution is utilized to redesign the prototype for experimentation to meet specified requirements. Six healthy participants and two hemiplegia patients participated in real experiments. Compared to the pre-optimization results, the average grasp success rate improved by 7.2%, while the muscle activity during walking and STS tasks decreased by an average of 12.7% and 25.1%, respectively.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) should help us handle these climate challenges but its most promising solutions are not good at dealing with climate-disrupted data; specifically, machine learning methods that work from historical data-distributions, are not good at handling out-of-distribution, outlier events. In this paper, we propose a novel data augmentation method, that treats the predictive problems around climate change as being, in part, due to class-imbalance issues; that is, prediction from historical datasets is difficult because, by definition, they lack sufficient minority-class instances of \"climate outlier events\". This novel data augmentation method -- called Counterfactual-Based SMOTE (CFA-SMOTE) -- combines an instance-based counterfactual method from Explainable AI (XAI) with the well-known class-imbalance method, SMOTE. CFA-SMOTE creates synthetic data-points representing outlier, climate-events that augment the dataset to improve predictive performance. We report comparative experiments using this CFA-SMOTE method, comparing it to benchmark counterfactual and class-imbalance methods under different conditions (i.e., class-imbalance ratios).

Motion capture (MoCap) systems are frequently used to generate ground truth annotations for human poses when training models with data from wearable or ambient sensors, and have been shown to be effective to synthesize data in these modalities. However, the representation of older adults, an increasingly important demographic in healthcare, in existing MoCap locomotion datasets has not been thoroughly examined. This work surveyed 41 publicly available datasets, identifying eight that include older adult motions and four that contain motions performed by younger actors annotated as old style. Older adults represent a small portion of participants overall, and few datasets provide full-body motion data for this group. To assess the fidelity of old-style walking motions, quantitative metrics are introduced, defining high fidelity as the ability to capture age-related differences relative to normative walking. Using gait parameters that are age-sensitive, robust to noise, and resilient to data scarcity, we found that old-style walking motions often exhibit overly controlled patterns and fail to faithfully characterize aging. These findings highlight the need for improved representation of older adults in motion datasets and establish a method to quantitatively evaluate the quality of old-style walking motions."}

We use the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (IRC) as a case study because its complexity makes it a fertile domain for identifying conflicts. Our research offers a solution for detecting inconsistent provisions by combining Large Language Models (LLMs) with symbolic logic.\n  LLM-based methods can support compliance, fairness, and statutory drafting, yet tax-specific applications remain sparse. A key challenge is that such models struggle with hierarchical processing and deep structured reasoning, especially over long text.\n  This research addresses these gaps through experiments using GPT-4o, GPT-5, and Prolog. GPT-4o was first used to translate Section 121 into Prolog rules and refine them in SWISH. These rules were then incorporated into prompts to test whether Prolog-augmented prompting improved GPT-4o's inconsistency detection. GPT-4o, whether prompted with natural language alone or with Prolog augmentation, detected the inconsistency in only one of three strategies (33 percent accuracy), but its reasoning quality differed: natural-language prompting achieved 100 percent rule coverage, while Prolog-augmented prompting achieved 66 percent, indicating more incomplete statutory analysis.\n  In contrast to probabilistic prompting, the hybrid Prolog model produced deterministic and reproducible results. Guided by GPT-5 for refinement, the model formalized the IRC section's competing interpretations and successfully detected an inconsistency zone. Validation tests confirm that the Prolog implementation is accurate, internally consistent, deterministic, and capable of autonomously identifying inconsistencies. These findings show that LLM-assisted formalization, anchored in symbolic logic, enables transparent and reliable statutory inconsistency detection."}

Alignment research has, to date, not sufficiently utilized perspectives and insights from the field of moral psychology to inform training and evaluation of frontier models. I perform a synthetic experiment on a wide range of models from most major model providers using Jonathan Haidt's influential moral foundations theory (MFT) to elicit diverse value judgments from LLMs. Using multiple descriptive statistical approaches, I document the bias and variance of large language model responses relative to a human baseline in the original survey. My results suggest that models rely on different moral foundations from one another and from a nationally representative human baseline, and these differences increase as model capabilities increase. This work seeks to spur further analysis of LLMs using MFT, including finetuning of open-source models, and greater deliberation by policymakers on the importance of moral foundations for LLM alignment."}

Existing reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods require over 2000+ hours of extensive training and often struggle to generalize to unfamiliar environments without additional fine-tuning, limiting their practical application in real-world scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose SocialNav-Map, a novel zero-shot social navigation framework that combines dynamic human trajectory prediction with occupancy mapping, enabling safe and efficient navigation without the need for environment-specific training. Specifically, SocialNav-Map first transforms the task goal position into the constructed map coordinate system. Subsequently, it creates a dynamic occupancy map that incorporates predicted human movements as dynamic obstacles. The framework employs two complementary methods for human trajectory prediction: history prediction and orientation prediction. By integrating these predicted trajectories into the occupancy map, the robot can proactively avoid potential collisions with humans while efficiently navigating to its destination. Extensive experiments on the Social-HM3D and Social-MP3D datasets demonstrate that SocialNav-Map significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) RL-based methods, which require 2,396 GPU hours of training. Notably, it reduces human collision rates by over 10% without necessitating any training in novel environments. By eliminating the need for environment-specific training, SocialNav-Map achieves superior navigation performance, paving the way for the deployment of social navigation systems in real-world environments characterized by diverse human behaviors.

Statement autoformalization, a crucial first step in this process, aims to translate informal descriptions into machine-verifiable representations but remains a significant challenge. The core difficulty lies in the fact that existing methods often suffer from a lack of contextual awareness, leading to hallucination of formal definitions and theorems. Furthermore, current retrieval-augmented approaches exhibit poor precision and recall for formal library dependency retrieval, and lack the scalability to effectively leverage ever-growing public datasets. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel retrieval-augmented framework based on DDR (\\textit{Direct Dependency Retrieval}) for statement autoformalization. Our DDR method directly generates candidate library dependencies from natural language mathematical descriptions and subsequently verifies their existence within the formal library via an efficient suffix array check. Leveraging this efficient search mechanism, we constructed a dependency retrieval dataset of over 500,000 samples and fine-tuned a high-precision DDR model. Experimental results demonstrate that our DDR model significantly outperforms SOTA methods in both retrieval precision and recall. Consequently, an autoformalizer equipped with DDR shows consistent performance advantages in both single-attempt accuracy and multi-attempt stability compared to models using traditional selection-based RAG methods."}

This paper introduces a leakage-aware data layer for student trajectory analytics, which serves as the methodological foundation for the CAPIRE framework for multilevel modelling. We propose a feature engineering design that organizes predictors into four levels: N1 (personal and socio-economic attributes), N2 (entry moment and academic history), N3 (curricular friction and performance), and N4 (institutional and macro-context variables)As a core component, we formalize the Value of Observation Time (VOT) as a critical design parameter that rigorously separates observation windows from outcome horizons, preventing data leakage by construction. An illustrative application in a long-cycle engineering program (1,343 students, ~57% dropout) demonstrates that VOT-restricted multilevel features support robust archetype discovery. A UMAP + DBSCAN pipeline uncovers 13 trajectory archetypes, including profiles of \"early structural crisis,\" \"sustained friction,\" and \"hidden vulnerability\" (low friction but high dropout). Bootstrap and permutation tests confirm these archetypes are statistically robust and temporally stable. We argue that this approach transforms feature engineering from a technical step into a central methodological artifact. This data layer serves as a disciplined bridge between retention theory, early-warning systems, and the future implementation of causal inference and agent-based modelling (ABM) within the CAPIRE program."}

While some works focus on opportunistic approaches for efficiency, others concentrate on pre-planned trajectories or scheduling for increased interpretability. However, scheduling usually requires knowledge of the environment beforehand, which prevents its deployment in several domains due to related uncertainties (e.g., underwater exploration). In our previous work, we proposed an intermittent communications framework for MRE under communication constraints that uses scheduled rendezvous events to mitigate such limitations. However, the system was unable to generate optimal plans and had no mechanisms to follow the plan considering realistic trajectories, which is not suited for real-world deployments. In this work, we further investigate the problem by formulating the Multi-Robot Exploration with Communication Constraints and Intermittent Connectivity (MRE-CCIC) problem. We propose a Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP) formulation to generate rendezvous plans and a policy to follow them based on the Rendezvous Tracking for Unknown Scenarios (RTUS) mechanism. The RTUS is a simple rule to allow robots to follow the assigned plan, considering unknown conditions. Finally, we evaluated our method in a large-scale environment configured in Gazebo simulations. The results suggest that our method can follow the plan promptly and accomplish the task efficiently. We provide an open-source implementation of both the MILP plan generator and the large-scale MRE-CCIC."}

Most existing methods adopt end-to-end training to facilitate intuitive answer verification. However, they lack fine-grained supervision and progressive traceability throughout the reasoning process. In this paper, we introduce the Chain-of-Evidence (CoE) paradigm for VD-RAG. CoE unifies Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and visual evidence attribution by grounding reference elements in reasoning steps to specific regions with bounding boxes and page indexes. To enable VLMs to generate such evidence-grounded reasoning, we propose Look As You Think (LAT), a reinforcement learning framework that trains models to produce verifiable reasoning paths with consistent attribution. During training, LAT evaluates the attribution consistency of each evidence region and provides rewards only when the CoE trajectory yields correct answers, encouraging process-level self-verification. Experiments on vanilla Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct with Paper- and Wiki-VISA benchmarks show that LAT consistently improves the vanilla model in both single- and multi-image settings, yielding average gains of 8.23% in soft exact match (EM) and 47.0% in IoU@0.5. Meanwhile, LAT not only outperforms the supervised fine-tuning baseline, which is trained to directly produce answers with attribution, but also exhibits stronger generalization across domains."}

In this increasingly competitive environment, many small and medium sized enterprises struggle to maintain customer satisfaction as rivals deliver higher quality services at lower cost. This study addresses the absence of robust measurement systems for assessing service quality, a key factor underlying customer attrition, by proposing an integrated framework for evaluating satisfaction and identifying sources of dissatisfaction in computer services.\n  The framework combines core principles of Six Sigma with the SERVQUAL instrument within a structured DMAIC methodology (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control). SERVQUAL provides the service quality dimensions and gap analysis techniques, while Six Sigma supplies the data driven approach to measurement and improvement. The literature suggests limited prior work integrating Lean Six Sigma with SERVQUAL, and this study contributes by operationalizing that integration in a real world setting.\n  A case study of a computer services company was conducted to demonstrate feasibility and effectiveness. Satisfaction levels were quantified, and root causes of dissatisfaction were identified. The analysis revealed a low overall satisfaction level and five primary drivers of unmet customer requirements. Addressing these causes is expected to increase customer satisfaction, lower customer acquisition costs, and improve overall organizational performance."}

This framework was operationalized through a quantitative survey of 140 Russian university educators, with responses analyzed using a binary flagging system to measure acceptance across key indicators. The results reveal a strong but conditional consensus: a majority of educators support ChatGPT's integration, contingent upon crucial factors such as the transformation of assessment methods and the availability of plagiarism detection tools. However, significant concerns persist regarding its impact on critical thinking. Educators largely reject the notion that AI diminishes their importance, viewing their role as evolving from information-deliverer to facilitator of critical engagement. The study concludes that ChatGPT acts less as a destroyer of education and more as a catalyst for its necessary evolution, and proposes the PIPE Model (Pedagogy, Infrastructure, Policy, Education) as a strategic framework for its responsible integration.

Model-based control approaches typically do not account for such uncertainty in the hybrid dynamics, while standard model-free RL methods fail to account for abrupt mode switches, leading to poor generalization.\n  To overcome this, we propose SAC-MoE which models the actor of the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) framework as a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with a learned router that adaptively selects among learned experts. To further improve robustness, we develop a curriculum-based training algorithm to prioritize data collection in challenging settings, allowing better generalization to unseen modes and switching locations. Simulation studies in hybrid autonomous racing and legged locomotion tasks show that SAC-MoE outperforms baselines (up to 6x) in zero-shot generalization to unseen environments.

We address data challenges -- such as missing demographic attributes, missing wage data, and noisy occupation labels -- through various data processing and Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods. In particular, we develop a large language models (LLMs) based occupation classification method known as FewSOC that achieves accuracy significantly higher than the original occupation labels in the resume dataset. Analysis of 228,710 career trajectories reveals that intra-firm occupation change has been found to facilitate upward mobility most strongly, followed by inter-firm occupation change and inter-firm lateral move.

Contemporary tyre manufacturing systems form complex networks of tightly coupled subsystems pronounced nonlinear interactions and emergent dynamics. This complexity renders the effective coordination of multiple subsystems, posing an essential yet formidable task. For high-dimensional, multi-objective optimization problems in this domain, we introduce a deep reinforcement learning algorithm: Multi-path Differentiated Clipping Proximal Policy Optimization (MPD-PPO). This algorithm employs a multi-branch policy architecture with differentiated gradient clipping constraints to ensure stable and efficient high-dimensional policy updates. Validated through experiments on width and thickness control in rubber tyre film production, MPD-PPO demonstrates substantial improvements in both tuning accuracy and operational efficiency. The framework successfully tackles key challenges, including high dimensionality, multi-objective trade-offs, and dynamic adaptation, thus delivering enhanced performance and production stability for real-time industrial deployment in tyre manufacturing."}

Complex driving scenarios contain rich semantic information, yet ambiguous or noisy semantics can compromise decision reliability, while interference between multiple driving tasks may hinder optimal planning. Furthermore, prolonged inference latency slows decision-making, increasing the risk of unsafe driving behaviors. To address these challenges, we propose ExpertAD, a novel framework that enhances the performance of ADS with Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture. We introduce a Perception Adapter (PA) to amplify task-critical features, ensuring contextually relevant scene understanding, and a Mixture of Sparse Experts (MoSE) to minimize task interference during prediction, allowing for effective and efficient planning. Our experiments show that ExpertAD reduces average collision rates by up to 20% and inference latency by 25% compared to prior methods. We further evaluate its multi-skill planning capabilities in rare scenarios (e.g., accidents, yielding to emergency vehicles) and demonstrate strong generalization to unseen urban environments. Additionally, we present a case study that illustrates its decision-making process in complex driving scenarios."}

In our model, ground base stations (BSs) cooperatively serve multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and employ a time-division strategy in which beam scanning for sensing comes before data communication in each time slot. To maximize the sum communication rate while satisfying the total sensing mutual information (MI) requirement, we jointly optimize the UAV trajectories, communication and sensing power allocation, and the dynamic time-division ratio. The resulting non-convex optimization problem is efficiently solved using an alternating optimization (AO) framework. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed joint design significantly outperforms benchmark schemes with static or partially optimized resources. The findings also reveal the critical importance of dynamic trajectory and resource management for effectively navigating the sensing-communication trade-off, especially under stringent power or sensing constraints."}

This is further enriched with accompanying pedagogical changes, such as strengthened asynchronous learning, and the use of AI (from ChatGPT and all other similar tools that followed) and other technologies to aid learning. While these educational transformations have enabled flexibility in learning and resource access, they have also exposed new challenges on how students can construct successful learning in hybrid learning environments. In this paper, we investigate the interaction between different dimensions of student learning experiences (ranging from perceived acceptance of teaching methods and staff support/feedback to learning pressure and student motivation) and academic achievement within the context of postgraduate blended learning in UK universities. To achieve this, we employed a combination of several data analytics techniques including visualization, statistical tests, regression analysis, and latent profile analysis. Our empirical results (based on a survey of 255 postgraduate students and holistically interpreted via the Community of Inquiry (CoI) framework) demonstrated that learning activities combining teaching and social presences, and tailored academic support through effective feedback are critical elements for successful postgraduate experience in blended learning contexts. Regarding contributions, this research advances the understanding of student success by identifying the various ways demographic, experiential, and psychological factors impact academic outcomes. And in theoretical terms, it contributes to the extension of the CoI framework by integrating the concept of learner heterogeneity and identifying four distinct student profiles based on how they engage in the different CoI presences."}

We implement and analyze MAML-TRPO's ability to learn a universal initialization that facilitates few-shot adaptation across semantically different manipulation behaviors including pushing, picking, and drawer manipulation. Our experiments demonstrate that MAML achieves effective one-shot adaptation with clear performance improvements after a single gradient update, reaching final success rates of 21.0% on training tasks and 13.2% on held-out test tasks. However, we observe a generalization gap that emerges during meta-training, where performance on test tasks plateaus while training task performance continues to improve. Task-level analysis reveals high variance in adaptation effectiveness, with success rates ranging from 0% to 80% across different manipulation skills. These findings highlight both the promise and current limitations of gradient-based meta-learning for diverse robotic manipulation, and suggest directions for future work in task-aware adaptation and structured policy architectures."}

Recent studies have shown that self-improving AI focusing on prompt optimization can outperform state-of-the-art reinforcement-learning fine-tuned LLMs. Here, their `performance' is typically measured by query efficiency - the number of LLM-generated solution samples required to meet a certain performance threshold. However, in many societal applications, the primary limitation is not generating new solutions but evaluating them. For instance, evaluating an ad's effectiveness requires significant human feedback, which is far more costly and time-consuming than generating a candidate ad. To optimize for the evaluation efficiency objective, a natural approach is to extend Bayesian Optimization (BO), a framework proven optimal for evaluation efficiency, to the language domain. However, the difficulty of directly estimating suitable acquisition functions in LLMs' minds makes this extension challenging. This paper overcomes this challenge by proving that the combination of the simple and widely used Best-of-N selection strategy and simple textual gradients (i.e., textual edits from a critic model) statistically emulates the behavior of the gradients on the canonical UCB acquisition function, which induces optimal exploration in terms of evaluation efficiency. Based on this result, we propose TextGrad-Best-of-N Bayesian Optimization (T-BoN BO), a simple and eval-efficient language-space Bayesian optimization framework for AI self-improvement. We also empirically validate T-BoN BO by applying it to automated ad alignment tasks for persona distribution, demonstrating its superior performance compared to popular state-of-the-art baselines."}

The higher the burden of any tax system, the costlier for society, as taxpayers are unable to engage in proper wealth creation when being kept busy with administrative tax work. This research finds evidence for a relationship between hours spent to comply with taxes and amount of tax payment. These findings help better understand tax administrative costs and ultimately may help reduce them. PwC and World Bank's final \"Paying taxes\"-publication (2019) contains tax data for most of the world's jurisdictions, in particular annual hours spent to comply with tax obligations (X) and annual amount of tax payments (Y), both for the year 2019. X and Y were plotted in 6 tests. A positive slope, satisfying p and r values, high mutual information and finally a conclusive scatter plot picture were the 5 requirements that all needed to be met to confirm a positive relationship between X and Y. The first 2 tests did not make any adjustments to the data, the next 2 tests removed cities --thereby avoiding the double counting of jurisdictions-- and the final 2 tests removed cities and outliers. Each test pair uses for Y first total number of payments; and for each second test the number of other payments, which excludes income tax payments for profit and labour. All 5 requirements were met in every of the 6 tests, indicating a positive dependence. In addition, 4 confirmatory tests validate the methodology. The found relationship is noticeably stronger for the total number of tax payments. Findings indicate that taxpayers' time spent on tax, and thereby society's overall tax administrative costs, could be reduced by simplifying taxation processes, including tax collection and payments."}

However, traditional teleoperation systems rely on inverse kinematics (IK) solvers and hand-tuned PD controllers, which struggle to handle external forces, adapt to different users, and produce natural motions under dynamic conditions. In this work, we propose a learning-based neural teleoperation framework that replaces the conventional IK+PD pipeline with learned policies trained via reinforcement learning. Our approach learns to directly map VR controller inputs to robot joint commands while implicitly handling force disturbances, producing smooth trajectories, and adapting to user preferences. We train our policies in simulation using demonstrations collected from IK-based teleoperation as initialization, then fine-tune them with force randomization and trajectory smoothness rewards. Experiments on the Unitree G1 humanoid robot demonstrate that our learned policies achieve 34% lower tracking error, 45% smoother motions, and superior force adaptation compared to the IK baseline, while maintaining real-time performance (50Hz control frequency). We validate our approach on manipulation tasks including object pick-and-place, door opening, and bimanual coordination. These results suggest that learning-based approaches can significantly improve the naturalness and robustness of humanoid teleoperation systems."}

Inspired by the word embedding paradigm in natural language processing, this paper proposes the Embedding CFR algorithm, a novel approach for solving strategies in IIEFGs within an embedding space. The algorithm pre-trains and embeds features of isolated information sets into an interconnected low-dimensional continuous space, where the resulting vectors more precisely capture both the distinctions and connections between information sets. Embedding CFR presents a strategy-solving process driven by regret accumulation and strategy updates within this embedding space, with accompanying theoretical analysis verifying its capacity to reduce cumulative regret. Experiments on poker show that with the same spatial overhead, Embedding CFR achieves significantly faster exploitability convergence compared to cluster-based abstraction algorithms, confirming its effectiveness. Furthermore, to our knowledge, it is the first algorithm in poker AI that pre-trains information set abstractions through low-dimensional embedding for strategy solving."}

Existing research on RIES decarbonization primarily focuses on the optimal low-carbon operation of system-level energy devices at the macro level, while the synergistic carbon-reduction effects of demand-side flexible loads and external carbon trading mechanisms have not been fully explored. Meanwhile, at the micro level, the carbon sensitivity of device parameters and their potential contribution to emission reduction remain insufficiently investigated. To address these gaps, this study integrates macro- and micro-level analyses. At the macro level, a multi-energy-coupled low-carbon optimal operation framework is developed, incorporating coordinated electric-thermal demand response (DR) and carbon trading. At the micro level, a carbon emission model for RIES components is established, and sensitivity analysis is conducted on 28 carbon-related parameters to identify highly sensitive determinants of emission reduction. Case studies based on typical operation data from a rural region in northern China demonstrate that coordinated electric-thermal DR and carbon trading can achieve maximum carbon-reduction potential.

We investigate temporal, demographic, and geographical patterns in the advertising strategies of major Australian political actors to establish an empirical evidence base, and interpret these findings through the lens of Social Identity Theory (SIT). Our findings not only reveal significant disparities in spending and reach among parties, but also in persuasion strategies being deployed in targeted online campaigns. We observe a marked increase in advertising activity as the election approached, peaking just before the mandated media blackout period. Demographic analysis shows distinct targeting strategies, with parties focusing more on younger demographics and exhibiting gender-based differences in ad impressions. Regional distribution of ads largely mirrored population densities, with some parties employing more targeted approaches in specific states. Moreover, we found that parties emphasized different themes aligned with their ideologies-major parties focused on party names and opponents, while smaller parties emphasized issue-specific messages. Drawing on SIT, we interpret these findings within Australia's compulsory voting context, suggesting that parties employed distinct persuasion strategies. With turnout guaranteed, major parties focused on reinforcing partisan identities to prevent voter defection, while smaller parties cultivated issue-based identities to capture the support of disaffected voters who are obligated to participate."}

While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at high-level task planning and scene understanding, they often struggle to infer actionable positions for physical interaction, such as functional grasping points and permissible placement regions. This limitation stems from the lack of fine-grained annotations for object and spatial affordances in their training datasets. To tackle this challenge, we introduce RoboAfford++, a generative AI-enhanced dataset for multimodal affordance learning for both robotic manipulation and navigation. Our dataset comprises 869,987 images paired with 2.0 million question answering (QA) annotations, covering three critical tasks: object affordance recognition to identify target objects based on attributes and spatial relationships, object affordance prediction to pinpoint functional parts for manipulation, and spatial affordance localization to identify free space for object placement and robot navigation. Complementing this dataset, we propose RoboAfford-Eval, a comprehensive benchmark for assessing affordance-aware prediction in real-world scenarios, featuring 338 meticulously annotated samples across the same three tasks. Extensive experimental results reveal the deficiencies of existing VLMs in affordance learning, while fine-tuning on the RoboAfford++ dataset significantly enhances their ability to reason about object and spatial affordances, validating the dataset's effectiveness."}

Existing research on RIES decarbonization primarily focuses on the optimal low-carbon operation of system-level energy devices at the macro level, while the synergistic carbon-reduction effects of demand-side flexible loads and external carbon trading mechanisms have not been fully explored. Meanwhile, at the micro level, the carbon sensitivity of device parameters and their potential contribution to emission reduction remain insufficiently investigated. To address these gaps, this study integrates macro- and micro-level analyses. At the macro level, a multi-energy-coupled low-carbon optimal operation framework is developed, incorporating coordinated electric-thermal demand response (DR) and carbon trading. At the micro level, a carbon emission model for RIES components is established, and sensitivity analysis is conducted on 28 carbon-related parameters to identify highly sensitive determinants of emission reduction. Case studies based on typical operation data from a rural region in northern China demonstrate that coordinated electric-thermal DR and carbon trading can achieve maximum carbon-reduction potential. Furthermore, the identified high-sensitivity parameters provide essential theoretical guidance for enhancing the decarbonization potential of RIES."}

It requires foresight to minimize overall changes to the clutter configuration while accessing target objects, avoiding stack destabilization and reducing the number of object removals required. Rule-based planners when applied to this problem, rely on rigid heuristics, leading to high computational overhead. End-to-end reinforcement learning approaches struggle with interpretability and generalizability over different conditions. To address these issues, we present ClutterNav, a novel decision-making framework that can identify the next best object to be removed so as to access a target object in a given clutter, while minimising stack disturbances. ClutterNav formulates the problem as a continuous reinforcement learning task, where each object removal dynamically updates the understanding of the scene. A removability critic, trained from demonstrations, estimates the cost of removing any given object based on geometric and spatial features. This learned cost is complemented by integrated gradients that assess how the presence or removal of surrounding objects influences the accessibility of the target. By dynamically prioritizing actions that balance immediate removability against long-term target exposure, ClutterNav achieves near human-like strategic sequencing, without predefined heuristics. The proposed approach is validated extensively in simulation and over real-world experiments. The results demonstrate real-time, occlusion-aware decision-making in partially observable environments."}

However, existing datasets and fine-tuning approaches still face challenges that lead to catastrophic forgetting, particularly for models smaller than 8B. First, most datasets typically ignore the relationship between training data knowledge and the model's inherent abilities, making it difficult to preserve prior knowledge. Second, conventional training objectives often fail to constrain inherent knowledge preservation, which can result in forgetting of previously learned skills. To address these issues, we propose a comprehensive solution that alleviates catastrophic forgetting from both the data and fine-tuning approach perspectives. On the data side, we construct a dataset of 5K instances that covers multiple reasoning tasks and incorporates metacognitive knowledge, making it more tolerant and effective for distillation into smaller models. We annotate the metacognitive knowledge required to solve each question and filter the data based on task knowledge and the model's inherent skills. On the training side, we introduce GDPO (Group Direction Preference Optimization), which is better suited for resource-limited scenarios and can efficiently approximate the performance of GRPO. Guided by the large model and by implicitly constraining the optimization path through a reference model, GDPO enables more effective knowledge transfer from the large model and constrains excessive parameter drift. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly alleviates catastrophic forgetting and improves reasoning performance on smaller models."}

The authors argue students across fields must be taught to responsibly and expertly harness the potential of AI tools to ensure job market readiness and positive outcomes. Computer Science trajectories are particularly impacted, and while consistently top ranked U.S. Computer Science departments teach the mechanisms and frameworks underlying AI, few appear to offer courses on applications for existing generative AI tools. A course was developed at a private research university to teach undergraduate and graduate Computer Science students applications for generative AI tools in software development.

Scree habitats, hosting unique and often endangered species, face severe threats from climate change due to their high-altitude nature. Traditionally, their monitoring has required highly skilled scientists to conduct extensive fieldwork in remote, potentially hazardous locations, making the process resource-intensive and time-consuming. This paper presents a novel approach for scree habitat monitoring using a legged robot to assist botanists in data collection and species identification. Specifically, we deployed the ANYmal C robot in the Italian Alpine bio-region in two field campaigns spanning two years and leveraged deep learning to detect and classify key plant species of interest. Our results demonstrate that agile legged robots can navigate challenging terrains and increase the frequency and efficiency of scree monitoring. When paired with traditional phytosociological surveys performed by botanists, this robotics-assisted protocol not only streamlines field operations but also enhances data acquisition, storage, and usage. The outcomes of this research contribute to the evolving landscape of robotics in environmental science, paving the way for a more comprehensive and sustainable approach to habitat monitoring and preservation."}

Existing methodologies typically treat molecular captioning (molecule-to-text) and text-based molecular design (text-to-molecule) as separate tasks, relying on supervised fine-tuning or contrastive learning pipelines. These approaches face three key limitations: (i) conventional metrics like BLEU prioritize linguistic fluency over chemical accuracy, (ii) training datasets frequently contain chemically ambiguous narratives with incomplete specifications, and (iii) independent optimization of generation directions leads to bidirectional inconsistency. To address these issues, we propose RTMol, a bidirectional alignment framework that unifies molecular captioning and text-to-SMILES generation through self-supervised round-trip learning. The framework introduces novel round-trip evaluation metrics and enables unsupervised training for molecular captioning without requiring paired molecule-text corpora. Experiments demonstrate that RTMol enhances bidirectional alignment performance by up to 47% across various LLMs, establishing an effective paradigm for joint molecule-text understanding and generation."}

Yet, the cost of adopting these AI services is understudied. Unlike traditional software licensing in which costs are predictable before usage, commercial LLM services charge per token of input text in addition to generated output tokens. Crucially, while firms can control the input, they have limited control over output tokens, which are effectively set by generation dynamics outside of business control. This research shows that subtle shifts in linguistic style can systematically alter the number of output tokens without impacting response quality. Using an experiment with OpenAI's API, this study reveals that non-polite prompts significantly increase output tokens leading to higher enterprise costs and additional revenue for OpenAI. Politeness is merely one instance of a broader phenomenon in which linguistic structure can drive unpredictable cost variation. For enterprises integrating LLM into applications, this unpredictability complicates budgeting and undermines transparency in business-to-business contexts. By demonstrating how end-user behavior links to enterprise costs through output token counts, this work highlights the opacity of current pricing models and calls for new approaches to ensure predictable and transparent adoption of LLM services."}

The algorithm models energy consumption based on the drone propulsion system and flight dynamics. We conduct extensive evaluations, comparing EcoFlight with direct-flight and shortest-distance schemes.

While existing reasoning approaches, such as materialisation based and automata based methods, offer soundness and completeness, they lack support for handling efficient dynamic updates, a crucial requirement for real-world applications that involve frequent data updates. In this work, we propose DRedMTL, an incremental reasoning algorithm for DatalogMTL with bounded intervals. Our algorithm builds upon the classical DRed algorithm, which incrementally updates the materialisation of a Datalog program. Unlike a Datalog materialisation which is in essence a finite set of facts, a DatalogMTL materialisation has to be represented as a finite set of facts plus periodic intervals indicating how the full materialisation can be constructed through unfolding. To cope with this, our algorithm is equipped with specifically designed operators to efficiently handle such periodic representations of DatalogMTL materialisations. We have implemented this approach and tested it on several publicly available datasets. Experimental results show that DRedMTL often significantly outperforms rematerialisation, sometimes by orders of magnitude."}

Traditional measures, such as the h-index, focus on publications and citations but fail to account for dataset accessibility, reuse, and cross-disciplinary influence.

Using datasets from computational social science, medicine, and crisis communication, we validate our approach against expert ratings, achieving a strong correlation. Our results demonstrate that the X-index provides a transparent, scalable, and low-cost framework for assessing data-sharing practices and incentivizing open science. The X-index encourages sustainable data-sharing practices and gives institutions, funders, and platforms a tangible way to acknowledge the lasting influence of research datasets."}

A 2R manipulator tracking a circular end-effector path is first examined because this case has a known analytical optimum: equal link lengths and the second joint orthogonal to the first. This serves as a validation step to test whether RL can rediscover the optimum using reward feedback alone, without access to the manipulability expression or the Jacobian. Three RL algorithms (SAC, DDPG, and PPO) are compared with grid search and black-box optimizers, with morphology represented by a single action parameter phi that maps to the link lengths. All methods converge to the analytical solution, showing that numerical recovery of the optimum is possible without supplying analytical structure.\n  Most morphology design tasks have no closed-form solutions, and grid or heuristic search becomes expensive as dimensionality increases. RL is therefore explored as a scalable alternative. The formulation used for the circular path is extended to elliptical and rectangular paths by expanding the action space to the full morphology vector (L1, L2, theta2). In these non-analytical settings, RL continues to converge reliably, whereas grid and black-box methods require far larger evaluation budgets. These results indicate that RL is effective for both recovering known optima and solving morphology optimization problems without analytical solutions."}

However, real-world Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are often incomplete, leading to the problem of Incomplete KGQA (IKGQA). A common solution is to incorporate external data to fill knowledge gaps, but existing methods lack the capacity to adaptively and contextually fuse multiple sources, failing to fully exploit their complementary strengths. To this end, we propose Debate over Mixed-knowledge (DoM), a novel framework that enables dynamic integration of structured and unstructured knowledge for IKGQA. Built upon the Multi-Agent Debate paradigm, DoM assigns specialized agents to perform inference over knowledge graphs and external texts separately, and coordinates their outputs through iterative interaction. It decomposes the input question into sub-questions, retrieves evidence via dual agents (KG and Retrieval-Augmented Generation, RAG), and employs a judge agent to evaluate and aggregate intermediate answers. This collaboration exploits knowledge complementarity and enhances robustness to KG incompleteness. In addition, existing IKGQA datasets simulate incompleteness by randomly removing triples, failing to capture the irregular and unpredictable nature of real-world knowledge incompleteness. To address this, we introduce a new dataset, Incomplete Knowledge Graph WebQuestions, constructed by leveraging real-world knowledge updates. These updates reflect knowledge beyond the static scope of KGs, yielding a more realistic and challenging benchmark. Through extensive experiments, we show that DoM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines."}

Current methods lack the adaptive policies needed to dynamically debug queries based on real-time execution feedback. This paper introduces a novel agentic framework where an LLM learns a resilient policy for the sequential process of iterative SPARQL construction. We show that a compact 3B-parameter model, trained exclusively via outcome-driven Reinforcement Learning (GRPO) without supervised fine-tuning, can learn effective policies for this task, discovering how to systematically recover from execution errors and refine its queries toward a correct answer. On a curated, executable single-answer subset of LC-QuAD 2.0, our agent achieves 49.7\\% accuracy post-entity-linking, a significant 17.5 percentage point improvement over the strongest iterative zero-shot baseline. Further analysis reveals that while the agent's capability is driven by RL, its performance is enhanced by an explicit deliberative reasoning step that acts as a cognitive scaffold to improve policy precision. This work presents a generalizable blueprint for teaching agents to master formal, symbolic tools through interaction, bridging the gap between probabilistic LLMs and the structured world of Knowledge Graphs."}

Typical DA strategies in the literature include collecting additional data in the target domain or re-training the model, or both. Both these strategies quickly become impractical as we increase scale and complexity of driving. These limitations have encouraged investigation into few-shot and zero-shot prompt-driven DA at inference time involving LLMs and VLMs. These methods work by adding a few state-action trajectories during inference to the prompt (similar to in-context learning). However, there are two limitations of such an approach: $(i)$ prompt-driven DA methods are currently restricted to perception tasks such as detection and segmentation and $(ii)$ they require expert few-shot data. In this work, we present a new approach to inference-time few-shot prompt-driven DA for closed-loop autonomous driving in adverse weather condition using in-context reinforcement learning (ICRL). Similar to other prompt-driven DA methods, our approach does not require any updates to the model parameters nor does it require additional data collection in adversarial weather regime. Furthermore, our approach advances the state-of-the-art in prompt-driven DA by extending to closed driving using general trajectories observed during inference. Our experiments using the CARLA simulator show that ICRL results in safer, more efficient, and more comfortable driving policies in the target domain compared to state-of-the-art prompt-driven DA baselines."}

While early approaches primarily focus on one-hop pairwise relationships, recent studies attempt to capture high-order interactions by stacking multiple Graph Neural Network (GNN) layers. However, these approaches face a fundamental trade-off: insufficient layers may lead to under-reaching problems that limit the model's receptive field, while excessive depth can result in prohibitive computational costs. We argue that an effective model should be capable of adaptively modeling both explicit one-hop interactions and implicit high-order dependencies, rather than relying solely on architectural depth. To this end, we propose ViTE (Virtual graph Trajectory Expert router), a novel framework for pedestrian trajectory prediction. ViTE consists of two key modules: a Virtual Graph that introduces dynamic virtual nodes to model long-range and high-order interactions without deep GNN stacks, and an Expert Router that adaptively selects interaction experts based on social context using a Mixture-of-Experts design. This combination enables flexible and scalable reasoning across varying interaction patterns. Experiments on three benchmarks (ETH/UCY, NBA, and SDD) demonstrate that our method consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating both its effectiveness and practical efficiency."}

In large or low-resource courses, instructors often lack the time, staffing, and bandwidth required to review and respond to every student reflection, creating gaps in support precisely where learners would benefit most. This paper presents a theory-grounded system that uses five coordinated role-based LLM agents (Evaluator, Equity Monitor, Metacognitive Coach, Aggregator, and Reflexion Reviewer) to score learner reflections with a shared rubric and to generate short, bias-aware, learner-facing comments. The agents first produce structured rubric scores, then check for potentially biased or exclusionary language, add metacognitive prompts that invite students to think about their own thinking, and finally compose a concise feedback message of at most 120 words. The system includes simple fairness checks that compare scoring error across lower and higher scoring learners, enabling instructors to monitor and bound disparities in accuracy. We evaluate the pipeline in a 12-session AI literacy program with adult learners. In this setting, the system produces rubric scores that approach expert-level agreement, and trained graders rate the AI-generated comments as helpful, empathetic, and well aligned with instructional goals. Taken together, these results show that multi-agent LLM systems can deliver equitable, high-quality formative feedback at a scale and speed that would be impossible for human graders alone. More broadly, the work points toward a future where feedback-rich learning becomes feasible for any course size or context, advancing long-standing goals of equity, access, and instructional capacity in education."}

Optimizing for such benchmarks risks misaligning evaluation with real-world utility. Our perspective is that evaluation should be grounded in generality rather than abstract notions of intelligence. We identify three assumptions that often underpin intelligence-focused evaluation: generality, stability, and realism. Through conceptual and formal analysis, we show that only generality withstands conceptual and empirical scrutiny. Intelligence is not what enables generality; generality is best understood as a multitask learning problem that directly links evaluation to measurable performance breadth and reliability. This perspective reframes how progress in AI should be assessed and proposes generality as a more stable foundation for evaluating capability across diverse and evolving tasks."}

The controversial directive obliged telecom and Internet access providers in Europe to retain metadata of all their customers for intelligence and law enforcement purposes, for a period of up to two years. In the ruling, the Court declared the directive in violation of the human rights to privacy and data protection. The Court also confirmed that the mere collection of metadata interferes with the human right to privacy. In addition, the Court developed three new criteria for assessing the level of data security required from a human rights perspective: security measures should take into account the risk of unlawful access to data, and the data's quantity and sensitivity. While organizations that campaigned against the directive have welcomed the ruling, we warn for the risk of proceduralization of mass surveillance law. The Court did not fully condemn mass surveillance that relies on metadata, but left open the possibility of mass surveillance if policymakers lay down sufficient procedural safeguards. Such proceduralization brings systematic risks for human rights. Government agencies, with ample resources, can design complicated systems of procedural oversight for mass surveillance - and claim that mass surveillance is lawful, even if it affects millions of innocent people."}

Previous methods tried to solve this problem by actively gathering multiple views before grasp pose generation. However, they either overlooked the importance of the grasp distribution for information gain estimation or relied on the projection of the grasp distribution, which ignores the structure of grasp poses on the SE(3) manifold. To tackle these challenges, we propose a calibrated energy-based model for grasp pose generation and an active view selection method that estimates information gain from grasp distribution. Our energy-based model captures the multi-modality nature of grasp distribution on the SE(3) manifold. The energy level is calibrated to the success rate of grasps so that the predicted distribution aligns with the real distribution. The next best view is selected by estimating the information gain for grasp from the calibrated distribution conditioned on the reconstructed environment, which could efficiently drive the robot to explore affordable parts of the target object. Experiments on simulated environments and real robot setups demonstrate that our model could successfully grasp objects in a cluttered environment with limited view budgets compared to previous state-of-the-art models. Our simulated environment can serve as a reproducible platform for future research on active grasping. The source code of our paper will be made public when the paper is released to the public."}

In this paper, we present DBPFinder, a simulation software that assists in the strategic sensor placement for detecting disinfection byproducts, tested at a real-world water distribution network in Coimbra, Portugal. This simulator addresses multiple performance objectives at once in order to provide optimal solution placement recommendations to water utility operators based on their needs. A number of different experiments performed indicate its correctness, relevance, efficiency and scalability."}

We demonstrate isolated gate driving for a gallium nitride (GaN) high-electron-mobility transistor, achieving a turn-on time of 108.8 ns comparable to commercial drivers and validate its operation in a buck converter. In addition, our SAW device operates over an ultrawide temperature range from 0.5 K (-272.6 °C) to 544 K (271 °C). The microwave-frequency SAW devices offer inherent EMI immunity and potential for heterogeneous integration on multiple semiconductor platforms, enabling compact, high-performance isolated power and signal transmission in advanced power electronics."}

However, imitation learning of interactive policies that coordinate with humans in shared spaces without explicit communication remains challenging, due to the significantly higher behavioral complexity in multi-agent interactions compared to non-interactive tasks. In this work, we introduce a structured imitation learning framework for interactive policies by combining generative single-agent policy learning with a flexible yet expressive game-theoretic structure. Our method explicitly separates learning into two steps: first, we learn individual behavioral patterns from multi-agent demonstrations using standard imitation learning; then, we structurally learn inter-agent dependencies by solving an inverse game problem. Preliminary results in a synthetic 5-agent social navigation task show that our method significantly improves non-interactive policies and performs comparably to the ground truth interactive policy using only 50 demonstrations. These results highlight the potential of structured imitation learning in interactive settings."}

We attribute this bottleneck to the agents' excessive reliance on static, internal knowledge within MLLMs, which leads to two critical failure points: 1) strategic hallucinations in high-level planning and 2) operational errors during low-level execution on user interfaces (UI). The core insight of this paper is that high-level planning and low-level UI operations require fundamentally distinct types of knowledge. Planning demands high-level, strategy-oriented experiences, whereas operations necessitate low-level, precise instructions closely tied to specific app UIs. Motivated by these insights, we propose Mobile-Agent-RAG, a novel hierarchical multi-agent framework that innovatively integrates dual-level retrieval augmentation. At the planning stage, we introduce Manager-RAG to reduce strategic hallucinations by retrieving human-validated comprehensive task plans that provide high-level guidance. At the execution stage, we develop Operator-RAG to improve execution accuracy by retrieving the most precise low-level guidance for accurate atomic actions, aligned with the current app and subtask. To accurately deliver these knowledge types, we construct two specialized retrieval-oriented knowledge bases. Furthermore, we introduce Mobile-Eval-RAG, a challenging benchmark for evaluating such agents on realistic multi-app, long-horizon tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mobile-Agent-RAG significantly outperforms SoTA baselines, improving task completion rate by 11.0% and step efficiency by 10.2%, establishing a robust paradigm for context-aware, reliable multi-agent mobile automation."}

This review provides a comprehensive analysis of state-of-the-art methodologies, applications and challenges at the intersection of LLMs and 3D vision, with a focus on next-generation robotic sensing technologies. We first introduce the foundational principles of LLMs and 3D data representations, followed by an in-depth examination of 3D sensing technologies critical for robotics. The review then explores key advancements in scene understanding, text-to-3D generation, object grounding and embodied agents, highlighting cutting-edge techniques such as zero-shot 3D segmentation, dynamic scene synthesis and language-guided manipulation. Furthermore, we discuss multimodal LLMs that integrate 3D data with touch, auditory and thermal inputs, enhancing environmental comprehension and robotic decision-making. To support future research, we catalog benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics tailored for 3D-language and vision tasks.

We jointly optimize the continuous trajectory and BS association to minimize handovers, path length, and flying time, subject to communication reliability and kinematic constraints. To address this problem, we reformulate it as an optimization based on the graph of convex sets (GCS). First, the URLLC requirement is translated into spatially feasible regions in the flight plane for each BS. And an intersection graph is constructed including the start and goal points. Each graph node is associated with a smooth and dynamically feasible trajectory segment. The trajectory is parameterized in space by Bézier curves and in time by a monotonic Bézier scaling, together with convex constraints that ensure continuity and enforce speed bounds. Next, we impose unit-flow constraints to enforce a single path, and by coupling the resulting binary edge-selection variables with the convex constraints, we obtain a mixed-integer convex program (MICP).

However, existing models struggle to accurately translate low-level actions (e.g., joint positions) into precise robotic movements in predicted frames, leading to inconsistencies with real-world physical interactions. To address these limitations, we propose MTV-World, an embodied world model that introduces Multi-view Trajectory-Video control for precise visuomotor prediction. Specifically, instead of directly using low-level actions for control, we employ trajectory videos obtained through camera intrinsic and extrinsic parameters and Cartesian-space transformation as control signals. However, projecting 3D raw actions onto 2D images inevitably causes a loss of spatial information, making a single view insufficient for accurate interaction modeling. To overcome this, we introduce a multi-view framework that compensates for spatial information loss and ensures high-consistency with physical world. MTV-World forecasts future frames based on multi-view trajectory videos as input and conditioning on an initial frame per view. Furthermore, to systematically evaluate both robotic motion precision and object interaction accuracy, we develop an auto-evaluation pipeline leveraging multimodal large models and referring video object segmentation models. To measure spatial consistency, we formulate it as an object location matching problem and adopt the Jaccard Index as the evaluation metric. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MTV-World achieves precise control execution and accurate physical interaction modeling in complex dual-arm scenarios."}

We formulate this as an out-of-distribution moral alignment problem, where LLM agents must learn to apply consistent moral reasoning frameworks to scenarios beyond their training distribution. We introduce Moral-Reason-QA, a novel dataset extending 680 human-annotated, high-ambiguity moral scenarios with framework-specific reasoning traces across utilitarian, deontological, and virtue ethics, enabling systematic evaluation of moral generalization in realistic decision contexts. Our learning approach employs Group Relative Policy Optimization with composite rewards that simultaneously optimize decision alignment and framework-specific reasoning processes to facilitate learning of the underlying moral frameworks. Experimental results demonstrate successful generalization to unseen moral scenarios, with softmax-normalized alignment scores improving by +0.757 for utilitarian and +0.450 for deontological frameworks when tested on out-of-distribution evaluation sets. The experiments also reveal training challenges and promising directions that inform future research. These findings establish that LLM agents can be systematically trained to internalize and apply specific moral frameworks to novel situations, providing a critical foundation for AI safety as language models become more integrated into human decision-making processes."}

I perform a synthetic experiment on a wide range of models from most major model providers using Jonathan Haidt's influential moral foundations theory (MFT) to elicit diverse value judgments from LLMs. Using multiple descriptive statistical approaches, I document the bias and variance of large language model responses relative to a human baseline in the original survey. My results suggest that models rely on different moral foundations from one another and from a nationally representative human baseline, and these differences increase as model capabilities increase. This work seeks to spur further analysis of LLMs using MFT, including finetuning of open-source models, and greater deliberation by policymakers on the importance of moral foundations for LLM alignment."}

Capturing the complete degree-of-freedom of force is imperative for accurate force measurement with six-axis force/torque sensors.

In this paper, a soft air-chamber type six-axis force/torque sensor with 16-channel barometers is introduced, which housed in hyper-elastic air chambers made of silicone rubber. Additionally, an effective decoupling method is proposed, based on a rigid-soft hierarchical structure, which reduces the six-axis decoupling problem to two three-axis decoupling problems. Finite element model simulation and experiments demonstrate the compatibility of the proposed approach with reality.

This is useful, e.g., for specifying and verifying desired system properties. While translating FOL into human-readable English is relatively straightforward, the inverse problem, converting NL to FOL (NL-FOL translation), has remained a longstanding challenge, for both humans and machines. Although the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) promised a breakthrough, recent literature provides contrasting results on their ability to perform NL-FOL translation. In this work, we provide a threefold contribution. First, we critically examine existing datasets and protocols for evaluating NL-FOL translation performance, revealing key limitations that may cause a misrepresentation of LLMs' actual capabilities. Second, to overcome these shortcomings, we propose a novel evaluation protocol explicitly designed to distinguish genuine semantic-level logical understanding from superficial pattern recognition, memorization, and dataset contamination. Third, using this new approach, we show that state-of-the-art, dialogue-oriented LLMs demonstrate strong NL-FOL translation skills and a genuine grasp of sentence-level logic, whereas embedding-centric models perform markedly worse."}

In this chapter, we describe A4L2.0 that leverages 1EdTech Consortium's open standards such as Edu-API, Caliper Analytics, and Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) to enable secure, interoperable data integration across data systems like Student Information Systems (SIS), LMS, and AI tools. The A4L2.0 data pipeline includes modules for data ingestion, preprocessing, organization, analytics, and visualization."}

Most high-performance control approaches for DWR explicitly utilize the linear and angular velocities of the trajectory as control references. However, existing research on time-optimal path parameterization (TOPP) for mobile robots usually neglects the angular velocity and joint vel- ocity constraints, which can result in degraded control perfor- mance in practical applications. In this article, a systematic and practical TOPP algorithm named TOPP-DWR is proposed for DWR and other mobile robots. First, the non-uniform B-spline is adopted to represent the initial trajectory in the task space. Second, the piecewise-constant angular velocity, as well as joint velocity, linear velocity, and linear acceleration constraints, are incorporated into the TOPP problem. During the construction of the optimization problem, the aforementioned constraints are uniformly represented as linear velocity constraints. To boost the numerical computational efficiency, we introduce a slack variable to reformulate the problem into second-order-cone programming (SOCP). Subsequently, comparative experiments are conducted to validate the superiority of the proposed method. Quantitative performance indexes show that TOPP-DWR achieves TOPP while adhering to all constraints. Finally, field autonomous navigation experiments are carried out to validate the practicability of TOPP-DWR in real-world applications."}

Despite these successes, existing methods mainly focus on single-domain RL (e.g., mathematics) with verifiable rewards (RLVR), and their reliance on purely online RL frameworks restricts the exploration space, thereby limiting reasoning performance. In this paper, we address these limitations by leveraging rubrics to provide both fine-grained reward signals and offline guidance. We propose $\\textbf{RGR-GRPO}$ (Reward and Guidance through Rubrics), a rubric-driven RL framework for multi-domain reasoning. RGR-GRPO enables LLMs to receive dense and informative rewards while exploring a larger solution space during GRPO training. Extensive experiments across 14 benchmarks spanning multiple domains demonstrate that RGR-GRPO consistently outperforms RL methods that rely solely on alternative reward schemes or offline guidance. Compared with verifiable online RL baseline, RGR-GRPO achieves average improvements of +7.0%, +5.4%, +8.4%, and +6.6% on mathematics, physics, chemistry, and general reasoning tasks, respectively. Notably, RGR-GRPO maintains stable entropy fluctuations during off-policy training and achieves superior pass@k performance, reflecting sustained exploration and effective breakthrough beyond existing performance bottlenecks."}

However, this makes the visual perception module a bottleneck, which constrains the overall capabilities of LVLMs. Conventional evaluation benchmarks, while rich in visual semantics, often contain unavoidable local shortcuts that can lead to an overestimation of models' perceptual abilities. Here, we introduce TopoPerception, a benchmark that leverages topological properties to rigorously evaluate the global visual perception capabilities of LVLMs across various granularities. Since topology depends on the global structure of an image and is invariant to local features, TopoPerception enables a shortcut-free assessment of global perception, fundamentally distinguishing it from semantically rich tasks. We evaluate state-of-the-art models on TopoPerception and find that even at the coarsest perceptual granularity, all models perform no better than random chance, indicating a profound inability to perceive global visual features. Notably, a consistent trend emerge within model families: more powerful models with stronger reasoning capabilities exhibit lower accuracy. This suggests that merely scaling up models is insufficient to address this deficit and may even exacerbate it. Progress may require new training paradigms or architectures. TopoPerception not only exposes a critical bottleneck in current LVLMs but also offers a lens and direction for improving their global visual perception.

Training-time strategies like procedural noise injection or learned mappings suffer from data inefficiency due to unrealistic noise simulation, which is often ineffective for grasping tasks that require fine manipulation or dependency on paired datasets heavily. Furthermore, leveraging foundation models to reduce the sim2real gap via intermediate representations fails to mitigate the domain shift fully and adds computational overhead during deployment. This work confronts dual challenges of data inefficiency and deployment complexity. We propose DiffuDepGrasp, a deploy-efficient sim2real framework enabling zero-shot transfer through simulation-exclusive policy training. Its core innovation, the Diffusion Depth Generator, synthesizes geometrically pristine simulation depth with learned sensor-realistic noise via two synergistic modules. The first Diffusion Depth Module leverages temporal geometric priors to enable sample-efficient training of a conditional diffusion model that captures complex sensor noise distributions, while the second Noise Grafting Module preserves metric accuracy during perceptual artifact injection. With only raw depth inputs during deployment, DiffuDepGrasp eliminates computational overhead and achieves a 95.7% average success rate on 12-object grasping with zero-shot transfer and strong generalization to unseen objects.Project website: https://diffudepgrasp.github.io/."}

Accepted at the 40th Annual AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2026)", "summary": "Despite the explosive growth of AI and the technologies built upon it, predicting and inferring the sub-optimal behavior of users or human collaborators remains a critical challenge. In many cases, such behaviors are not a result of irrationality, but rather a rational decision made given inherent cognitive bounds and biased beliefs about the world. In this paper, we formally introduce a class of computational-rational (CR) user models for cognitively-bounded agents acting optimally under biased beliefs. The key novelty lies in explicitly modeling how a bounded memory process leads to a dynamically inconsistent and biased belief state and, consequently, sub-optimal sequential decision-making. We address the challenge of identifying the latent user-specific bound and inferring biased belief states from passive observations on the fly. We argue that for our formalized CR model family with an explicit and parameterized cognitive process, this challenge is tractable. To support our claim, we propose an efficient online inference method based on nested particle filtering that simultaneously tracks the user's latent belief state and estimates the unknown cognitive bound from a stream of observed actions. We validate our approach in a representative navigation task using memory decay as an example of a cognitive bound. With simulations, we show that (1) our CR model generates intuitively plausible behaviors corresponding to different levels of memory capacity, and (2) our inference method accurately and efficiently recovers the ground-truth cognitive bounds from limited observations ($\\le 100$ steps). We further demonstrate how this approach provides a principled foundation for developing adaptive AI assistants, enabling adaptive assistance that accounts for the user's memory limitations."}

Recent studies have confirmed the overly confident tendencies of machine-generated responses, particularly in large language models (LLMs). As these systems are increasingly embedded in ethical decision-making scenarios, it is important to understand their moral reasoning and the inherent uncertainties in building reliable AI systems. This work examines how uncertainty influences moral decisions in the classical trolley problem, analyzing responses from 32 open-source models and 9 distinct moral dimensions. We first find that variance in model confidence is greater across models than within moral dimensions, suggesting that moral uncertainty is predominantly shaped by model architecture and training method. To quantify uncertainty, we measure binary entropy as a linear combination of total entropy, conditional entropy, and mutual information. To examine its effects, we introduce stochasticity into models via \"dropout\" at inference time. Our findings show that our mechanism increases total entropy, mainly through a rise in mutual information, while conditional entropy remains largely unchanged. Moreover, this mechanism significantly improves human-LLM moral alignment, with correlations in mutual information and alignment score shifts. Our results highlight the potential to better align model-generated decisions and human preferences by deliberately modulating uncertainty and reducing LLMs' confidence in morally complex scenarios."}

In this paper, we address the IIN problem, by introducing SplatSearch, a novel architecture that leverages sparse-view 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) reconstructions. SplatSearch renders multiple viewpoints around candidate objects using a sparse online 3DGS map, and uses a multi-view diffusion model to complete missing regions of the rendered images, enabling robust feature matching against the goal image. A novel frontier exploration policy is introduced which uses visual context from the synthesized viewpoints with semantic context from the goal image to evaluate frontier locations, allowing the robot to prioritize frontiers that are semantically and visually relevant to the goal image.

Motivated by sub-transmission operations at RTE, this paper considers the Optimal Transmission Switching with De-energization (OTSD), which captures potential loss of connectivity (and therefore localized blackout) following loss of transmission elements. While directly relevant to real-life operations, this problem has received very little attention in the literature. The paper proposes a new mixed-integer linear programming formulation for OTSD that represents post-contingency loss of connectivity without requiring additional binary variables. This new formulation provides the foundation for a fast, iterative heuristic algorithm. Computational experiments confirms that state-of-the-art optimization solvers struggle to solve the extensive formulation of OTSD, often failing to find even trivial solutions within reasonable time. In contrast, numerical results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed heuristic, which finds high-quality feasible solutions 100-1000x faster than using Gurobi."}

To address the problems, we propose a framework integrating safe path generation, adaptive confidence updates, and confidence-aware exploration strategies. Using Kalman-based elevation estimation, our approach generates terrain traversability and confidence scores, then incorporates them into Graph-Based exploration Planner (GBP) to prioritize exploration of traversable low-confidence regions.

While they can produce reasoning-like content via methods such as chain-of-thought prompting, these outputs are typically unstructured and informal, obscuring whether models truly understand the fundamental reasoning paradigms that underpin scientific inference. To address this, we introduce a novel task named Latent Reasoning Chain Extraction (ARCHE), in which models must decompose complex reasoning arguments into combinations of standard reasoning paradigms in the form of a Reasoning Logic Tree (RLT). In RLT, all reasoning steps are explicitly categorized as one of three variants of Peirce's fundamental inference modes: deduction, induction, or abduction. To facilitate this task, we release ARCHE Bench, a new benchmark derived from 70 Nature Communications articles, including more than 1,900 references and 38,000 viewpoints. We propose two logic-aware evaluation metrics: Entity Coverage (EC) for content completeness and Reasoning Edge Accuracy (REA) for step-by-step logical validity. Evaluations on 10 leading LLMs on ARCHE Bench reveal that models exhibit a trade-off between REA and EC, and none are yet able to extract a complete and standard reasoning chain. These findings highlight a substantial gap between the abilities of current reasoning models and the rigor required for scientific argumentation."}

This paper introduces a leakage-aware data layer for student trajectory analytics, which serves as the methodological foundation for the CAPIRE framework for multilevel modelling. We propose a feature engineering design that organizes predictors into four levels: N1 (personal and socio-economic attributes), N2 (entry moment and academic history), N3 (curricular friction and performance), and N4 (institutional and macro-context variables)As a core component, we formalize the Value of Observation Time (VOT) as a critical design parameter that rigorously separates observation windows from outcome horizons, preventing data leakage by construction. An illustrative application in a long-cycle engineering program (1,343 students, ~57% dropout) demonstrates that VOT-restricted multilevel features support robust archetype discovery. A UMAP + DBSCAN pipeline uncovers 13 trajectory archetypes, including profiles of \"early structural crisis,\" \"sustained friction,\" and \"hidden vulnerability\" (low friction but high dropout). Bootstrap and permutation tests confirm these archetypes are statistically robust and temporally stable. We argue that this approach transforms feature engineering from a technical step into a central methodological artifact.

This article puts forward a general and systematic post-processing algorithm for A* and other graph-search-based planners. The A* post-processing algorithm, called APP, is developed based on the costmap, which is widely used in commercial service robots. First, a bidirectional vertices reduction algorithm is proposed to tackle the asymm- etry of the path and the environments. During the forward and backward vertices reduction, a thorough shortcut strategy is put forward to improve the path-shortening performance and avoid unnecessary heading changes. Second, an iterative path perturbation algorithm is adopted to locally reduce the number of unnecessary heading changes and improve the path smooth- ness.

Indeed, neuromorphic engineering could provide low-latency, low-energy and adaptive control systems in the form of spiking neural networks (SNNs) exploiting spike-based control and communication. However, systematic methods for designing and analyzing neuron-inspired spiking controllers are currently lacking. This paper presents a new systematic approach for stabilizing linear time-invariant (LTI) systems using SNN-based controllers, designed as a network of integrate-and-fire neurons, whose input is the measured output from the plant and generating spiking control signals. The new approach consists of a two-step emulation-based design procedure. In the first step, we establish conditions on the neuron parameters to ensure that the spiking signal generated by a pair of neurons emulates any continuous-time signal input to the neurons with arbitrary accuracy in terms of a special metric for spiky signals. In the second step, we propose a novel stability notion, called integral spiking-input-to-state stability (iSISS) building on this special metric. We prove that an asymptotically stable LTI system has this iSISS property. By combining these steps, a certifiable practical stability property of the closed-loop system can be established. Generalizations are discussed and the effectiveness of the approach is illustrated in a numerical case study."}

In the literature, global path planning methods for free space usually focus on path length and neglect the traffic rule constraints of the environments, which leads to high-frequency re-planning and increases collision risks.

This article proposes a general and systematic approach to improve global path planning performance in semi-structured environments. A unidirectional road network is built to represent the traffic constraints in semi-structured environments and a hybrid strategy is proposed to achieve a guaranteed planning result.Cutting across the road at the starting and the goal points are allowed to achieve a shorter path. Especially, a two-layer potential map is proposed to achieve a guaranteed performance when the starting and the goal points are in complex intersections. Comparative experiments are carried out to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

To this end, we propose PCRS-TKA, a prompt-based framework employing retrieval-augmented generation to integrate PLMs with KGs. PCRS-TKA constructs dialogue-specific knowledge trees from KGs and serializes them into texts, enabling structure-aware reasoning while capturing rich entity semantics.

Existing Control Barrier Function (CBF) frameworks, such as High-Order CBFs (HOCBFs), effectively guarantee safety in continuous time but may become unsafe when executed under zero-order-hold (ZOH) controllers due to inter-sampling effects. Moreover, they do not explicitly handle finite-time reach-and-remain requirements or multiple simultaneous constraints, which often lead to conflicts between safety and reach-and-remain objectives, resulting in feasibility issues during control synthesis. This paper introduces Sampling-Aware Control Barrier Functions (SACBFs), a unified framework that accounts for sampling effects and high relative-degree constraints by estimating and incorporating Taylor-based upper bounds on barrier evolution between sampling instants. The proposed method guarantees continuous-time forward invariance of safety and finite-time reach-and-remain sets under ZOH control.

The effectiveness of this integration critically depends on accurate alignment between the sensor reference frames. Standard model-based alignment methods between these sensor systems suffer from lengthy convergence times, dependence on prescribed motion patterns, and reliance on external aiding sensors, significantly limiting operational flexibility. To address these limitations, this paper presents ResAlignNet, a data-driven approach using the 1D ResNet-18 architecture that transforms the alignment problem into deep neural network optimization, operating as an in-situ solution that requires only sensors on board without external positioning aids or complex vehicle maneuvers, while achieving rapid convergence in seconds. Additionally, the approach demonstrates the learning capabilities of Sim2Real transfer, enabling training in synthetic data while deploying in operational sensor measurements. Experimental validation using the Snapir autonomous underwater vehicle demonstrates that ResAlignNet achieves alignment accuracy within 0.8° using only 25 seconds of data collection, representing a 65\\% reduction in convergence time compared to standard velocity-based methods. The trajectory-independent solution eliminates motion pattern requirements and enables immediate vehicle deployment without lengthy pre-mission procedures, advancing underwater navigation capabilities through robust sensor-agnostic alignment that scales across different operational scenarios and sensor specifications."}

In human-agent teams, artificial agents need to adapt to their human partners in real time, as individuals often have unique preferences and policies that may change dynamically throughout interactions. This becomes particularly challenging in tasks with time pressure and complex strategic spaces, where identifying partner behaviors and selecting suitable responses is difficult. In this work, we introduce a strategy-conditioned cooperator framework that learns to represent, categorize, and adapt to a broad range of potential partner strategies in real-time. Our approach encodes strategies with a variational autoencoder to learn a latent strategy space from agent trajectory data, identifies distinct strategy types through clustering, and trains a cooperator agent conditioned on these clusters by generating partners of each strategy type. For online adaptation to novel partners, we leverage a fixed-share regret minimization algorithm that dynamically infers and adjusts the partner's strategy estimation during interaction. We evaluate our method in a modified version of the Overcooked domain, a complex collaborative cooking environment that requires effective coordination among two players with a diverse potential strategy space. Through these experiments and an online user study, we demonstrate that our proposed agent achieves state of the art performance compared to existing baselines when paired with novel human, and agent teammates."}

Optimal foraging means following the Marginal Value Theorem (MVT), in which individuals exploit a patch of semantically related concepts until it becomes less rewarding and then switch to a new cluster. While human behavioral data suggests foraging-like patterns in semantic fluency tasks, it remains unclear whether modern high-dimensional embedding spaces provide representations that allow algorithms to match observed human behavior. Using state-of-the-art embeddings and prior semantic fluency data, I find that random walks on these embedding spaces produce results consistent with optimal foraging and the MVT. Surprisingly, introducing Metropolis-Hastings sampling, an adaptive algorithm expected to model strategic acceptance and rejection of new clusters, does not produce results consistent with human behavior. These findings challenge the assumption that more complex sampling mechanisms inherently lead to better cognitive models of memory retrieval. Instead, they show that appropriately structured embeddings, even with simple sampling, can produce near-optimal foraging dynamics. This supports the perspective of Hills (2012) rather than Abbott (2015), demonstrating that modern embeddings can approximate human memory foraging without relying on complex acceptance criteria."}

Unlearning addresses this challenge by selectively removing parametric knowledge from the trained models without retraining from scratch, which is critical for resource-intensive models such as Large Language Models (LLMs). Existing unlearning methods often degrade model performance by removing more information than necessary when attempting to ''forget'' specific data. We introduce Forgetting-MarI, an LLM unlearning framework that provably removes only the additional (marginal) information contributed by the data to be unlearned, while preserving the information supported by the data to be retained. By penalizing marginal information, our method yields an explicit upper bound on the unlearn dataset's residual influence in the trained models, providing provable undetectability. Extensive experiments confirm that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art unlearning methods, delivering reliable forgetting and better preserved general model performance across diverse benchmarks. This advancement represents an important step toward making AI systems more controllable and compliant with privacy and copyright regulations without compromising their effectiveness."}

In order to study reproducibility and scalability, a parametric design framework establishes deterministic rules linking actuator chamber dimensions to lattice unit cell size. Experimental homogenization of lattice specimens provides effective material properties for finite element simulation. Within this simulation environment, sensor placement is treated as a discrete optimization problem, where a finite set of candidate waveguide paths derived from lattice nodes is evaluated by introducing local stiffening, and the configuration minimizing deviation from baseline mechanical response is selected. Optimized models are fabricated and experimentally characterized, validating the preservation of mechanical performance while enabling embedded sensing. The workflow is further extended to scaled units and a two-finger gripper, demonstrating generality of the MU concept.

Visual responses generated through a three-stage process (JSON extraction, LLM reasoning, and Tool Function) were evaluated using SSIM and LPIPS metrics; Chain-of-Thought scores and error types (semantic hallucination, numeric misperception) were analyzed. Results demonstrate that GPT-4.1-Mini consistently achieved the highest overall accuracy across all architectures, indicating a strong reasoning capability.

In such scenarios, accurate odometry estimation is a preliminary requirement for stable locomotion, localization, and mapping. Traditional proprioceptive approaches, which rely on leg kinematics sensor modalities and inertial sensing, suffer from irrepressible vertical drift caused by frequent contact impacts, foot slippage, and vibrations, particularly affected by inaccurate roll and pitch estimation. Existing methods incorporate exteroceptive sensors such as LiDAR or cameras. Further enhancement has been introduced by leveraging gravity vector estimation to add additional observations on roll and pitch, thereby increasing the accuracy of vertical pose estimation. However, these approaches tend to degrade in feature-sparse or repetitive scenes and are prone to errors from double-integrated IMU acceleration. To address these challenges, we propose GaRLILEO, a novel gravity-aligned continuous-time radar-leg-inertial odometry framework. GaRLILEO decouples velocity from the IMU by building a continuous-time ego-velocity spline from SoC radar Doppler and leg kinematics information, enabling seamless sensor fusion which mitigates odometry distortion. In addition, GaRLILEO can reliably capture accurate gravity vectors leveraging a novel soft S2-constrained gravity factor, improving vertical pose accuracy without relying on LiDAR or cameras. Evaluated on a self-collected real-world dataset with diverse indoor-outdoor trajectories, GaRLILEO demonstrates state-of-the-art accuracy, particularly in vertical odometry estimation on stairs and slopes.

We evaluate cross-subject generalization and demonstrate that fine-tuning pre-trained models with a small sample of subject-specific data increases average F1 scores by 17% and 41% for binary and multi-class models, respectively. Our work demonstrates that mapping implicit fNIRS signals to agent performance is feasible and can be improved, laying the foundation for future brain-driven RLHF systems."}

Submitted to L4DC 2026", "summary": "This paper proposes MATT-Diff: Multi-Modal Active Target Tracking by Diffusion Policy, a control policy that captures multiple behavioral modes - exploration, dedicated tracking, and target reacquisition - for active multi-target tracking. The policy enables agent control without prior knowledge of target numbers, states, or dynamics. Effective target tracking demands balancing exploration for undetected or lost targets with following the motion of detected but uncertain ones. We generate a demonstration dataset from three expert planners including frontier-based exploration, an uncertainty-based hybrid planner switching between frontier-based exploration and RRT* tracking based on target uncertainty, and a time-based hybrid planner switching between exploration and tracking based on target detection time. We design a control policy utilizing a vision transformer for egocentric map tokenization and an attention mechanism to integrate variable target estimates represented by Gaussian densities. Trained as a diffusion model, the policy learns to generate multi-modal action sequences through a denoising process. Evaluations demonstrate MATT-Diff's superior tracking performance against expert and behavior cloning baselines across multiple target motions, empirically validating its advantages in target tracking."}

Artificial Intelligence (AI) should help us handle these climate challenges but its most promising solutions are not good at dealing with climate-disrupted data; specifically, machine learning methods that work from historical data-distributions, are not good at handling out-of-distribution, outlier events. In this paper, we propose a novel data augmentation method, that treats the predictive problems around climate change as being, in part, due to class-imbalance issues; that is, prediction from historical datasets is difficult because, by definition, they lack sufficient minority-class instances of \"climate outlier events\". This novel data augmentation method -- called Counterfactual-Based SMOTE (CFA-SMOTE) -- combines an instance-based counterfactual method from Explainable AI (XAI) with the well-known class-imbalance method, SMOTE. CFA-SMOTE creates synthetic data-points representing outlier, climate-events that augment the dataset to improve predictive performance. We report comparative experiments using this CFA-SMOTE method, comparing it to benchmark counterfactual and class-imbalance methods under different conditions (i.e., class-imbalance ratios).

We use the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (IRC) as a case study because its complexity makes it a fertile domain for identifying conflicts. Our research offers a solution for detecting inconsistent provisions by combining Large Language Models (LLMs) with symbolic logic.\n  LLM-based methods can support compliance, fairness, and statutory drafting, yet tax-specific applications remain sparse. A key challenge is that such models struggle with hierarchical processing and deep structured reasoning, especially over long text.\n  This research addresses these gaps through experiments using GPT-4o, GPT-5, and Prolog. GPT-4o was first used to translate Section 121 into Prolog rules and refine them in SWISH. These rules were then incorporated into prompts to test whether Prolog-augmented prompting improved GPT-4o's inconsistency detection. GPT-4o, whether prompted with natural language alone or with Prolog augmentation, detected the inconsistency in only one of three strategies (33 percent accuracy), but its reasoning quality differed: natural-language prompting achieved 100 percent rule coverage, while Prolog-augmented prompting achieved 66 percent, indicating more incomplete statutory analysis.\n  In contrast to probabilistic prompting, the hybrid Prolog model produced deterministic and reproducible results. Guided by GPT-5 for refinement, the model formalized the IRC section's competing interpretations and successfully detected an inconsistency zone. Validation tests confirm that the Prolog implementation is accurate, internally consistent, deterministic, and capable of autonomously identifying inconsistencies. These findings show that LLM-assisted formalization, anchored in symbolic logic, enables transparent and reliable statutory inconsistency detection."}

Moreover, traditional step-wise and episodic RL methods often neglect the contact-rich information inherent in task-space manipulation, especially considering the contact-safety and robustness. In this work, contact-rich manipulation tasks are tackled using a task-space, energy-safe framework, where reliable and safe task-space trajectories are generated through the combination of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and movement primitives.

Recent advances in artificial intelligence and social robotics offer new opportunities to examine social anxiety in the human-robot interaction context. Accurate detection of affective states and behaviours associated with social anxiety requires multimodal datasets, where each signal modality provides complementary insights into its manifestations. However, such datasets remain scarce, limiting progress in both research and applications. To address this, this paper presents a protocol for multimodal dataset collection designed to reflect social anxiety in a human-robot interaction context. The dataset will consist of synchronised audio, video, and physiological recordings acquired from at least 70 participants, grouped according to their level of social anxiety, as they engage in approximately 10-minute interactive Wizard-of-Oz role-play scenarios with the Furhat social robot under controlled experimental conditions. In addition to multimodal data, the dataset will be enriched with contextual data providing deeper insight into individual variability in social anxiety responses.

It proposes a novel theoretical model that conceptualizes the educational environment as a \"Learning Space\" composed of seven subspaces to systematically identify the impact of AI integration. This framework was operationalized through a quantitative survey of 140 Russian university educators, with responses analyzed using a binary flagging system to measure acceptance across key indicators. The results reveal a strong but conditional consensus: a majority of educators support ChatGPT's integration, contingent upon crucial factors such as the transformation of assessment methods and the availability of plagiarism detection tools. However, significant concerns persist regarding its impact on critical thinking. Educators largely reject the notion that AI diminishes their importance, viewing their role as evolving from information-deliverer to facilitator of critical engagement.

Precision grasping enables tool use and is believed to have influenced human evolution. Today's multi-fingered robotic hands are effective in power grasps, but for tasks requiring precision, parallel grippers are still more widely adopted. This contrast highlights a key limitation in current robotic hand design: the difficulty of achieving both stable power grasps and precise, fine-grained manipulation within a single, versatile system. In this work, we bridge this gap by jointly optimizing the control and hardware design of a multi-fingered dexterous hand, enabling both power and precision manipulation. Rather than redesigning the entire hand, we introduce a lightweight fingertip geometry modification, represent it as a contact plane, and jointly optimize its parameters along with the corresponding control. Our control strategy dynamically switches between power and precision manipulation and simplifies precision control into parallel thumb-index motions, which proves robust for sim-to-real transfer. On the design side, we leverage large-scale simulation to optimize the fingertip geometry using a differentiable neural-physics surrogate model. We validate our approach through extensive experiments in both sim-to-real and real-to-real settings. Our method achieves an 82.5% zero-shot success rate on unseen objects in sim-to-real precision grasping, and a 93.3% success rate in challenging real-world tasks involving bread pinching. These results demonstrate that our co-design framework can significantly enhance the fine-grained manipulation ability of multi-fingered hands without reducing their ability for power grasps.

Here, we introduce Yanyun-3, a general-purpose agent framework that, for the first time, enables autonomous cross-platform operation across three heterogeneous strategy game environments. By integrating the vision-language reasoning of Qwen2.5-VL with the precise execution capabilities of UI-TARS, Yanyun-3 successfully performs core tasks including target localization, combat resource allocation, and area control. Through systematic ablation studies, we evaluate the effects of various multimodal data combinations--static images, multi-image sequences, and videos--and propose the concept of combination granularity to differentiate between intra-sample fusion and inter-sample mixing strategies. We find that a hybrid strategy, which fuses multi-image and video data while mixing in static images (MV+S), substantially outperforms full fusion: it reduces inference time by 63% and boosts the BLEU-4 score by a factor of 12 (from 4.81% to 62.41%, approximately 12.98x). Operating via a closed-loop pipeline of screen capture, model inference, and action execution, the agent demonstrates strong real-time performance and cross-platform generalization.

Therefore, the defender's final position in one game becomes its starting position for the next. We divide an intruder-defender engagement into two phases, partial information and full information, depending on the information available to the players. We address the capturability of an intruder by the defender using the notions of Dubins path and guarding arc.

ARCSnake V2 combines the high mobility of hyper redundant snake robots with the terrain versatility of Archimedean screw propulsion.

Traditional methods such as manual inspection and blanket pesticide spraying often lead to excessive chemical use, resource waste, and environmental impact. While unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) offer a promising platform for precision agriculture through targeted spraying and improved operational efficiency, existing UAV-based approaches remain limited by battery life, payload capacity, and scalability, especially in large fields where single-UAV or uniformly distributed spraying is insufficient. Although multi-UAV coordination has been explored, many current frameworks still assume uniform spraying and do not account for infestation severity, UAV dynamics, non-uniform resource allocation, or energy-efficient coordination.\n  To address these limitations, this paper proposes a Density-Driven Optimal Control (D2OC) framework that integrates Optimal Transport (OT) theory with multi-UAV coverage control for large-scale agricultural spraying. The method supports non-uniform, priority-aware resource allocation based on infestation intensity, reducing unnecessary chemical application. UAVs are modeled as a linear time-varying (LTV) system to capture variations in mass and inertia during spraying missions. The D2OC control law, derived using Lagrangian mechanics, enables efficient coordination, balanced workload distribution, and improved mission duration. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms uniform spraying and Spectral Multiscale Coverage (SMC) in coverage efficiency, chemical reduction, and operational sustainability, providing a scalable solution for smart agriculture."}

However, current agents struggle with repetitive errors and lack the ability to learn from past experiences across sessions, limiting their long-term robustness and sample efficiency. We introduce WebCoach, a model-agnostic self-evolving framework that equips web browsing agents with persistent cross-session memory, enabling improved long-term planning, reflection, and continual learning without retraining. WebCoach consists of three key components: (1) a WebCondenser, which standardizes raw navigation logs into concise summaries; (2) an External Memory Store, which organizes complete trajectories as episodic experiences; and (3) a Coach, which retrieves relevant experiences based on similarity and recency, and decides whether to inject task-specific advice into the agent via runtime hooks. This design empowers web agents to access long-term memory beyond their native context window, improving robustness in complex browsing tasks. Moreover, WebCoach achieves self-evolution by continuously curating episodic memory from new navigation trajectories, enabling agents to improve over time without retraining. Evaluations on the WebVoyager benchmark demonstrate that WebCoach consistently improves the performance of browser-use agents across three different LLM backbones. With a 38B model, it increases task success rates from 47% to 61% while reducing or maintaining the average number of steps. Notably, smaller base models with WebCoach achieve performance comparable to the same web agent using GPT-4o."}

Statement autoformalization, a crucial first step in this process, aims to translate informal descriptions into machine-verifiable representations but remains a significant challenge. The core difficulty lies in the fact that existing methods often suffer from a lack of contextual awareness, leading to hallucination of formal definitions and theorems. Furthermore, current retrieval-augmented approaches exhibit poor precision and recall for formal library dependency retrieval, and lack the scalability to effectively leverage ever-growing public datasets. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel retrieval-augmented framework based on DDR (\\textit{Direct Dependency Retrieval}) for statement autoformalization. Our DDR method directly generates candidate library dependencies from natural language mathematical descriptions and subsequently verifies their existence within the formal library via an efficient suffix array check. Leveraging this efficient search mechanism, we constructed a dependency retrieval dataset of over 500,000 samples and fine-tuned a high-precision DDR model. Experimental results demonstrate that our DDR model significantly outperforms SOTA methods in both retrieval precision and recall. Consequently, an autoformalizer equipped with DDR shows consistent performance advantages in both single-attempt accuracy and multi-attempt stability compared to models using traditional selection-based RAG methods."}

Existing uniform coverage strategies are insufficient for realistic applications, and many non-uniform approaches either lack optimality guarantees or fail to incorporate crucial real-world constraints such as agent dynamics, limited operation time, the number of agents, and decentralized execution.\n  To resolve these limitations, we propose a novel framework called Density-Driven Optimal Control (D2OC). The central idea of D2OC is the integration of optimal transport theory with multi-agent coverage control, enabling each agent to continuously adjust its trajectory to match a mission-specific reference density map. The proposed formulation establishes optimality by solving a constrained optimization problem that explicitly incorporates physical and operational constraints. The resulting control input is analytically derived from the Lagrangian of the objective function, yielding closed-form optimal solutions for linear systems and a generalizable structure for nonlinear systems. Furthermore, a decentralized data-sharing mechanism is developed to coordinate agents without reliance on global information.\n  Comprehensive simulation studies demonstrate that D2OC achieves significantly improved non-uniform area coverage performance compared to existing methods, while maintaining scalability and decentralized implementability."}

However, in fields that rely on professional knowledge, such as medicine and law, such large-scale preference labels are often unachievable. In this paper, we propose a generative entropy-guided preference modeling approach named GEM for LLMs aligment at low-resource and domain-specific scenarios. Instead of training a discriminative reward model on preference data, we directly train the LLM to internalize a closed-loop optimization architecture that can extract and exploit the multi-dimensional, fine-grained cognitive signals implicit in human preferences. Specifically, our Cognitive Filtering module, based on entropy theory in decision making, first leverages Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to generate diverse candidate reasoning chains (CoTs) from preference data. Subsequently, it introduces a token scoring mechanism to rank and weight the sampled CoTs, boosting the importance of high-confidence answers and strategically high-entropy tokens. Building on these filtered preferences, we fine-tune the LLM using a novel self-evaluated group advantage algorithm, SEGA, which effectively aggregates group-level cognitive signals and transforms the entropy-based scores into implicit rewards for policy optimization. In these ways, GEM empowers the LLM to rely on its own judgments and establishes an entropy-guided closed-loop cognitive optimization framework, enabling highly efficient few-shot alignment of LLMs. Experiments on general benchmarks and domain-specific tasks (such as mathematical reasoning and medical dialogues) demonstrate that our GEM achieves significant improvements with few-shot preference data."}

Most existing methods adopt end-to-end training to facilitate intuitive answer verification. However, they lack fine-grained supervision and progressive traceability throughout the reasoning process. In this paper, we introduce the Chain-of-Evidence (CoE) paradigm for VD-RAG. CoE unifies Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and visual evidence attribution by grounding reference elements in reasoning steps to specific regions with bounding boxes and page indexes. To enable VLMs to generate such evidence-grounded reasoning, we propose Look As You Think (LAT), a reinforcement learning framework that trains models to produce verifiable reasoning paths with consistent attribution. During training, LAT evaluates the attribution consistency of each evidence region and provides rewards only when the CoE trajectory yields correct answers, encouraging process-level self-verification. Experiments on vanilla Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct with Paper- and Wiki-VISA benchmarks show that LAT consistently improves the vanilla model in both single- and multi-image settings, yielding average gains of 8.23% in soft exact match (EM) and 47.0% in IoU@0.5.

Understanding such nuances is a requirement for successful natural communication, and often requires building a local world model which encodes such elements and captures the dynamics of their evolving states. However, it is not well-understood whether language models (LMs) construct or maintain a robust implicit representation of conversations. In this work, we evaluate the ability of LMs to encode and update their internal world model in dyadic conversations and test their malleability under linguistic alterations. To facilitate this, we apply seven minimal linguistic alterations to conversations sourced from popular datasets and construct two benchmarks comprising yes-no questions. We evaluate a wide range of open and closed source LMs and observe that they struggle to maintain robust accuracy. Our analysis unveils that LMs struggle to memorize crucial details, such as tracking entities under linguistic alterations to conversations. We then propose a dual-perspective interpretability framework which identifies transformer layers that are useful or harmful and highlights linguistic alterations most influenced by harmful layers, typically due to encoding spurious signals or relying on shortcuts. Inspired by these insights, we propose two layer-regularization based fine-tuning strategies that suppress the effect of the harmful layers."}

However, the reasoning underlying these solutions is often flawed. Advancing to rigorous proof-based mathematics requires reliable proof verification capabilities. We begin by analyzing multiple evaluation setups and show that focusing on a single benchmark can lead to brittle or misleading conclusions. To address this, we evaluate both proof-based and final-answer reasoning to obtain a more reliable measure of model performance. We then scale two major generative verification methods (GenSelect and LLM-as-a-Judge) to millions of tokens and identify their combination as the most effective framework for solution verification and selection. We further show that the choice of prompt for LLM-as-a-Judge significantly affects the model's performance, but reinforcement learning can reduce this sensitivity. However, despite improving proof-level metrics, reinforcement learning does not enhance final-answer precision, indicating that current models often reward stylistic or procedural correctness rather than mathematical validity. Our results establish practical guidelines for designing and evaluating scalable proof-verification and selection systems."}

We address data challenges -- such as missing demographic attributes, missing wage data, and noisy occupation labels -- through various data processing and Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods. In particular, we develop a large language models (LLMs) based occupation classification method known as FewSOC that achieves accuracy significantly higher than the original occupation labels in the resume dataset. Analysis of 228,710 career trajectories reveals that intra-firm occupation change has been found to facilitate upward mobility most strongly, followed by inter-firm occupation change and inter-firm lateral move. Women and Black college graduates experience significantly lower returns from job changes than men and White peers. Multilevel sensitivity analyses confirm that these disparities are robust to cluster-level heterogeneity and reveal additional intersectional patterns."}

This paper introduces Sampling-Based Adaptive Motion Planning (SBAMP), a novel framework that overcomes these limitations by integrating RRT* for global path planning with a SEDS-based local controller for continuous, adaptive trajectory adjustment. Our approach requires no pre-trained datasets and ensures smooth transitions between planned waypoints, maintaining stability through Lyapunov-based guarantees. We validate SBAMP in both simulated environments and real hardware using the RoboRacer platform, demonstrating superior performance in dynamic obstacle scenarios, rapid recovery from perturbations, and robust handling of sharp turns.

To address these issues, we propose STEP (Success-rate-aware Trajectory-Efficient Policy optimization), a framework that dynamically allocates sampling based on per-task success rates and performs step-level optimization. STEP maintains a smoothed success-rate record to guide adaptive trajectory resampling, allocating more effort to harder tasks. It then computes success-rate-weighted advantages and decomposes trajectories into step-level samples. Finally, it applies a step-level GRPO augmentation to refine updates for low-success tasks.

In this paper, we introduce a trajectory-alignment-based definition of the minimum forecast horizon and propose an algorithm that identifies the minimum planning horizon for which all rolling-horizon control decisions match those of the full-horizon global optimization. Using real price data from the bidding zone DK1 in Denmark of the Nord Pool day-ahead market and a realistic ESS model, we illustrate that $60$ hours of forecast horizon allows us to exactly simulate the global control sequence and economic outcomes. In addition, we illustrate that under other parameter configurations, no forecast horizon ensures full convergence, demonstrating the sensitivity of the existence of a forecast horizon to various parameters. Our findings provide an operationally significant framework for minimum forecast horizon detection in storage scheduling and pave the way for the analytical description of this important planning measure."}

Crucially, it incorporates interactive graph editing, allowing users to perform a \"what-if\" analysis by perturbing graph structures and observing immediate impacts on GNN predictions and explanations. We detail the system architecture and, through case studies on Cora and CiteSeer datasets, demonstrate how InteractiveGNNExplainer facilitates in-depth misclassification diagnosis, comparative analysis of GCN versus GAT behaviors, and rigorous probing of model sensitivity. These capabilities foster a deeper, multifaceted understanding of GNN predictions, contributing to more transparent, trustworthy, and robust graph analysis."}

Recent studies have shown that self-improving AI focusing on prompt optimization can outperform state-of-the-art reinforcement-learning fine-tuned LLMs. Here, their `performance' is typically measured by query efficiency - the number of LLM-generated solution samples required to meet a certain performance threshold. However, in many societal applications, the primary limitation is not generating new solutions but evaluating them. For instance, evaluating an ad's effectiveness requires significant human feedback, which is far more costly and time-consuming than generating a candidate ad. To optimize for the evaluation efficiency objective, a natural approach is to extend Bayesian Optimization (BO), a framework proven optimal for evaluation efficiency, to the language domain. However, the difficulty of directly estimating suitable acquisition functions in LLMs' minds makes this extension challenging. This paper overcomes this challenge by proving that the combination of the simple and widely used Best-of-N selection strategy and simple textual gradients (i.e., textual edits from a critic model) statistically emulates the behavior of the gradients on the canonical UCB acquisition function, which induces optimal exploration in terms of evaluation efficiency. Based on this result, we propose TextGrad-Best-of-N Bayesian Optimization (T-BoN BO), a simple and eval-efficient language-space Bayesian optimization framework for AI self-improvement. We also empirically validate T-BoN BO by applying it to automated ad alignment tasks for persona distribution, demonstrating its superior performance compared to popular state-of-the-art baselines."}

We challenge the notion that more communication is always beneficial, hypothesizing instead that the core issue is the absence of resource rationality. We argue that \"free\" communication, by ignoring the principle of scarcity, inherently breeds inefficiency and unnecessary expenses. To address this, we introduce the Dynamic Auction-based Language Agent (DALA), a novel framework that treats communication bandwidth as a scarce and tradable resource. Specifically, our DALA regards inter-agent communication as a centralized auction, where agents learn to bid for the opportunity to speak based on the predicted value density of their messages. Thus, our DALA intrinsically encourages agents to produce concise, informative messages while filtering out low-value communication. Extensive and comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our economically-driven DALA achieves new state-of-the-art performance across seven challenging reasoning benchmarks, including 84.32% on MMLU and a 91.21% pass@1 rate on HumanEval. Note that this is accomplished with remarkable efficiency, i.e., our DALA uses only 6.25 million tokens, a fraction of the resources consumed by current state-of-the-art methods on GSM8K. Further analysis reveals that our DALA cultivates the emergent skill of strategic silence, effectively adapting its communication strategies from verbosity to silence in a dynamical manner via resource constraints."}

State-of-the-art AI methods rely on pre-trained discrete clustering for abstraction, yet their hard classification irreversibly loses critical information: specifically, the quantifiable subtle differences between information sets-vital for strategy solving-thereby compromising the quality of such solving. Inspired by the word embedding paradigm in natural language processing, this paper proposes the Embedding CFR algorithm, a novel approach for solving strategies in IIEFGs within an embedding space. The algorithm pre-trains and embeds features of isolated information sets into an interconnected low-dimensional continuous space, where the resulting vectors more precisely capture both the distinctions and connections between information sets. Embedding CFR presents a strategy-solving process driven by regret accumulation and strategy updates within this embedding space, with accompanying theoretical analysis verifying its capacity to reduce cumulative regret.

Furthermore, to our knowledge, it is the first algorithm in poker AI that pre-trains information set abstractions through low-dimensional embedding for strategy solving."}

Our objective is to produce a baseline schedule that can be reused multiple times in an industrial setting regardless of the actual duration scenario. We leverage Graph Neural Networks in conjunction with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to develop an effective policy for task scheduling. This policy operates similarly to a priority dispatch rule and is paired with a Serial Schedule Generation Scheme to produce a schedule. Our empirical evaluation on standard benchmarks demonstrates the approach's superiority in terms of performance and its ability to generalize.

In this paper we propose a verbalization strategy to communicate robot plans informatively, by measuring the information gain that verbalizations have against a second-order theory of mind of the user capturing his prior knowledge on the robot. As shown in our experiments, this strategy allows to understand the robot's goal much quicker than by using strategies such as increasing or decreasing plan order. In addition, following our formulation we hint to what is informative and why when a robot communicates its plan."}

Among its implementations in robotic manipulation, Diffusion Policy (DP), with its two variants DP-CNN (DP-C) and DP-Transformer (DP-T), is one of the most effective and widely adopted models, demonstrating the advantages of predicting continuous action sequences. However, both DP and other BC methods remain constrained by the scarcity of paired training data, and the internal mechanisms underlying DP's effectiveness remain insufficiently understood, leading to limited generalization and a lack of principled design in model development. In this work, we propose a decoupled training recipe that leverages nearly cost-free kinematics-generated trajectories as observation-free data to pretrain a general action head (action generator). The pretrained action head is then frozen and adapted to novel tasks through feature modulation. Our experiments demonstrate the feasibility of this approach in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios. As an additional benefit, decoupling improves training efficiency; for instance, DP-C achieves up to a 41% speedup. Furthermore, the confinement of task-specific knowledge to the conditioning components under decoupling, combined with the near-identical performance of DP-C in both normal and decoupled training, indicates that the action generation backbone plays a limited role in robotic manipulation. Motivated by this observation, we introduce DP-MLP, which replaces the 244M-parameter U-Net backbone of DP-C with only 4M parameters of simple MLP blocks, achieving a 83.9% faster training speed under normal training and 89.1% under decoupling."}

However, the lack of training in specialized areas hinders their accuracy. Current training methods train a unified large language model (LLM) for all agents in the system. This may limit the performances due to different distributions underlying for different agents. Therefore, training multi-agent systems with distinct LLMs should be the next step to solve. However, this approach introduces optimization challenges. For example, agents operate at different frequencies, rollouts involve varying sub-agent invocations, and agents are often deployed across separate servers, disrupting end-to-end gradient flow. To address these issues, we propose M-GRPO, a hierarchical extension of Group Relative Policy Optimization designed for vertical Multi-agent systems with a main agent (planner) and multiple sub-agents (multi-turn tool executors). M-GRPO computes group-relative advantages for both main and sub-agents, maintaining hierarchical credit assignment. It also introduces a trajectory-alignment scheme that generates fixed-size batches despite variable sub-agent invocations. We deploy a decoupled training pipeline in which agents run on separate servers and exchange minimal statistics via a shared store. This enables scalable training without cross-server backpropagation. In experiments on real-world benchmarks (e.g., GAIA, XBench-DeepSearch, and WebWalkerQA), M-GRPO consistently outperforms both single-agent GRPO and multi-agent GRPO with frozen sub-agents, demonstrating improved stability and sample efficiency. These results show that aligning heterogeneous trajectories and decoupling optimization across specialized agents enhances tool-augmented reasoning tasks."}

Using techniques from spectral graph theory, we demonstrate that higher connectivity makes networks more resilient to perception distortion. Our analysis of stochastic block models, however, shows that pronounced community structure increases vulnerability. We also study the problem of minimizing the perception gap via link recommendation with a fixed budget.

Recent studies have confirmed the overly confident tendencies of machine-generated responses, particularly in large language models (LLMs). As these systems are increasingly embedded in ethical decision-making scenarios, it is important to understand their moral reasoning and the inherent uncertainties in building reliable AI systems. This work examines how uncertainty influences moral decisions in the classical trolley problem, analyzing responses from 32 open-source models and 9 distinct moral dimensions. We first find that variance in model confidence is greater across models than within moral dimensions, suggesting that moral uncertainty is predominantly shaped by model architecture and training method. To quantify uncertainty, we measure binary entropy as a linear combination of total entropy, conditional entropy, and mutual information. To examine its effects, we introduce stochasticity into models via \"dropout\" at inference time. Our findings show that our mechanism increases total entropy, mainly through a rise in mutual information, while conditional entropy remains largely unchanged. Moreover, this mechanism significantly improves human-LLM moral alignment, with correlations in mutual information and alignment score shifts. Our results highlight the potential to better align model-generated decisions and human preferences by deliberately modulating uncertainty and reducing LLMs' confidence in morally complex scenarios."}

However, existing datasets and fine-tuning approaches still face challenges that lead to catastrophic forgetting, particularly for models smaller than 8B. First, most datasets typically ignore the relationship between training data knowledge and the model's inherent abilities, making it difficult to preserve prior knowledge. Second, conventional training objectives often fail to constrain inherent knowledge preservation, which can result in forgetting of previously learned skills. To address these issues, we propose a comprehensive solution that alleviates catastrophic forgetting from both the data and fine-tuning approach perspectives. On the data side, we construct a dataset of 5K instances that covers multiple reasoning tasks and incorporates metacognitive knowledge, making it more tolerant and effective for distillation into smaller models. We annotate the metacognitive knowledge required to solve each question and filter the data based on task knowledge and the model's inherent skills. On the training side, we introduce GDPO (Group Direction Preference Optimization), which is better suited for resource-limited scenarios and can efficiently approximate the performance of GRPO. Guided by the large model and by implicitly constraining the optimization path through a reference model, GDPO enables more effective knowledge transfer from the large model and constrains excessive parameter drift. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly alleviates catastrophic forgetting and improves reasoning performance on smaller models."}

Bolstered by growing reasoning capabilities, large language models (LLMs) offer a promising path to enhance healthcare predictions by drawing on their rich parametric knowledge. However, LLMs are prone to factual inaccuracies due to limitations in the reliability and coverage of their embedded knowledge. While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) frameworks, such as GraphRAG and its variants, have been proposed to mitigate these issues by incorporating external knowledge, they face two key challenges in the healthcare scenario: (1) identifying the clinical necessity to activate the retrieval mechanism, and (2) achieving synergy between the retriever and the generator to craft contextually appropriate retrievals. To address these challenges, we propose GHAR, a \\underline{g}enerative \\underline{h}ierarchical \\underline{a}gentic \\underline{R}AG framework that simultaneously resolves when to retrieve and how to optimize the collaboration between submodules in healthcare. Specifically, for the first challenge, we design a dual-agent architecture comprising Agent-Top and Agent-Low. Agent-Top acts as the primary physician, iteratively deciding whether to rely on parametric knowledge or to initiate retrieval, while Agent-Low acts as the consulting service, summarising all task-relevant knowledge once retrieval was triggered. To tackle the second challenge, we innovatively unify the optimization of both agents within a formal Markov Decision Process, designing diverse rewards to align their shared goal of accurate prediction while preserving their distinct roles. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets across three popular tasks demonstrate our superiority over state-of-the-art baselines, highlighting the potential of hierarchical agentic RAG in advancing healthcare systems."}

These approaches face three key limitations: (i) conventional metrics like BLEU prioritize linguistic fluency over chemical accuracy, (ii) training datasets frequently contain chemically ambiguous narratives with incomplete specifications, and (iii) independent optimization of generation directions leads to bidirectional inconsistency. To address these issues, we propose RTMol, a bidirectional alignment framework that unifies molecular captioning and text-to-SMILES generation through self-supervised round-trip learning.

In addition, we incorporate a reinforcement-learning-based fine-tuning, which preserves supervised behavior cloning priors while injecting reward-guided improvements. Despite a compact 160M parameter budget, DAP achieves state-of-the-art performance on open-loop metrics and delivers competitive closed-loop results on the NAVSIM benchmark.

Particularly, Neuro-Evolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) has been employed to generate dynamic gait parameters for the serpenoid gait function, which is implemented on the joint angles of the snake robot, thus controlling the robot on a desired dynamic path. NEAT is a single neural-network based evolutionary algorithm that is known to work extremely well when the input layer is of significantly higher dimension and the output layer is of a smaller size. For the planar snake robot, the input layer consists of the joint angles, link positions, head link position as well as obstacle positions in the vicinity. However, the output layer consists of only the frequency and offset angle of the serpenoid gait that control the speed and heading of the robot, respectively. Obstacle data from a LiDAR and the robot data from various sensors, along with the location of the end goal and time, are employed to parametrize a reward function that is maximized over iterations by selective propagation of superior neural networks. The implementation and experimental results showcase that the proposed approach is computationally efficient, especially for large environments with many obstacles.

This approach formulates multi-agent coordination as a dynamic potential game, where the Nash equilibrium (NE) defines optimal control strategies across agents.

Using behavioural, representational and mechanistic analyses, we uncover two fundamentally different learned algorithms. The Foraging model develops a robust, map-like representation of space, akin to a 'cognitive map'. Causal interventions reveal that it learns to consolidate spatial information into a self-sufficient coordinate system, evidenced by a sharp phase transition where its reliance on historical direction tokens vanishes by the middle layers of the network. The model also adopts an adaptive, hierarchical reasoning system, switching between a low-level heuristic for short contexts and map-based inference for longer ones. In contrast, the goal-directed models learn a path-dependent algorithm, remaining reliant on explicit directional inputs throughout all layers. The hybrid model, despite demonstrating improved generalisation over its parent, retains the same path-dependent strategy. These findings suggest that the nature of spatial intelligence in transformers may lie on a spectrum, ranging from generalisable world models shaped by exploratory data to heuristics optimised for goal-directed tasks. We provide a mechanistic account of this generalisation-optimisation trade-off and highlight how the choice of training regime influences the strategies that emerge."}

While existing reasoning approaches, such as materialisation based and automata based methods, offer soundness and completeness, they lack support for handling efficient dynamic updates, a crucial requirement for real-world applications that involve frequent data updates. In this work, we propose DRedMTL, an incremental reasoning algorithm for DatalogMTL with bounded intervals. Our algorithm builds upon the classical DRed algorithm, which incrementally updates the materialisation of a Datalog program. Unlike a Datalog materialisation which is in essence a finite set of facts, a DatalogMTL materialisation has to be represented as a finite set of facts plus periodic intervals indicating how the full materialisation can be constructed through unfolding. To cope with this, our algorithm is equipped with specifically designed operators to efficiently handle such periodic representations of DatalogMTL materialisations. We have implemented this approach and tested it on several publicly available datasets. Experimental results show that DRedMTL often significantly outperforms rematerialisation, sometimes by orders of magnitude."}

An efficient variable impedance control (VIC) method is developed to enhance human-robot interaction, particularly in scenarios involving external force disturbances. By dynamically adjusting impedance parameters, VIC improves the dynamic switching between rigidity and flexibility, so that it can adapt to unknown environmental disturbances in different states.

Designing a general-purpose SRL device is inherently challenging, particularly when developing a unified theoretical framework that meets the diverse functional requirements of both upper and lower limbs. In this paper, we propose a multi-objective optimization (MOO) design theory that integrates grasping workspace similarity, walking workspace similarity, braced force for sit-to-stand (STS) movements, and overall mass and inertia. A geometric vector quantification method is developed using an ellipsoid to represent the workspace, aiming to reduce computational complexity and address quantification challenges. The ellipsoid envelope transforms workspace points into ellipsoid attributes, providing a parametric description of the workspace. Furthermore, the STS static braced force assesses the effectiveness of force transmission. The overall mass and inertia restricts excessive link length. To facilitate rapid and stable convergence of the model to high-dimensional irregular Pareto fronts, we introduce a multi-subpopulation correction firefly algorithm. This algorithm incorporates a strategy involving attractive and repulsive domains to effectively handle the MOO task. The optimized solution is utilized to redesign the prototype for experimentation to meet specified requirements. Six healthy participants and two hemiplegia patients participated in real experiments. Compared to the pre-optimization results, the average grasp success rate improved by 7.2%, while the muscle activity during walking and STS tasks decreased by an average of 12.7% and 25.1%, respectively.

A common solution is to incorporate external data to fill knowledge gaps, but existing methods lack the capacity to adaptively and contextually fuse multiple sources, failing to fully exploit their complementary strengths. To this end, we propose Debate over Mixed-knowledge (DoM), a novel framework that enables dynamic integration of structured and unstructured knowledge for IKGQA. Built upon the Multi-Agent Debate paradigm, DoM assigns specialized agents to perform inference over knowledge graphs and external texts separately, and coordinates their outputs through iterative interaction. It decomposes the input question into sub-questions, retrieves evidence via dual agents (KG and Retrieval-Augmented Generation, RAG), and employs a judge agent to evaluate and aggregate intermediate answers. This collaboration exploits knowledge complementarity and enhances robustness to KG incompleteness. In addition, existing IKGQA datasets simulate incompleteness by randomly removing triples, failing to capture the irregular and unpredictable nature of real-world knowledge incompleteness. To address this, we introduce a new dataset, Incomplete Knowledge Graph WebQuestions, constructed by leveraging real-world knowledge updates. These updates reflect knowledge beyond the static scope of KGs, yielding a more realistic and challenging benchmark.

While early approaches primarily focus on one-hop pairwise relationships, recent studies attempt to capture high-order interactions by stacking multiple Graph Neural Network (GNN) layers. However, these approaches face a fundamental trade-off: insufficient layers may lead to under-reaching problems that limit the model's receptive field, while excessive depth can result in prohibitive computational costs. We argue that an effective model should be capable of adaptively modeling both explicit one-hop interactions and implicit high-order dependencies, rather than relying solely on architectural depth. To this end, we propose ViTE (Virtual graph Trajectory Expert router), a novel framework for pedestrian trajectory prediction. ViTE consists of two key modules: a Virtual Graph that introduces dynamic virtual nodes to model long-range and high-order interactions without deep GNN stacks, and an Expert Router that adaptively selects interaction experts based on social context using a Mixture-of-Experts design. This combination enables flexible and scalable reasoning across varying interaction patterns.

To address these limitations, we propose SocialNav-Map, a novel zero-shot social navigation framework that combines dynamic human trajectory prediction with occupancy mapping, enabling safe and efficient navigation without the need for environment-specific training. Specifically, SocialNav-Map first transforms the task goal position into the constructed map coordinate system. Subsequently, it creates a dynamic occupancy map that incorporates predicted human movements as dynamic obstacles. The framework employs two complementary methods for human trajectory prediction: history prediction and orientation prediction. By integrating these predicted trajectories into the occupancy map, the robot can proactively avoid potential collisions with humans while efficiently navigating to its destination. Extensive experiments on the Social-HM3D and Social-MP3D datasets demonstrate that SocialNav-Map significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) RL-based methods, which require 2,396 GPU hours of training. Notably, it reduces human collision rates by over 10% without necessitating any training in novel environments. By eliminating the need for environment-specific training, SocialNav-Map achieves superior navigation performance, paving the way for the deployment of social navigation systems in real-world environments characterized by diverse human behaviors.

Techniques such as SHAP, LIME, Integrated Gradients, saliency mapping, and attention visualisation are mapped to corresponding DCB artefacts.

In our previous work, we proposed an intermittent communications framework for MRE under communication constraints that uses scheduled rendezvous events to mitigate such limitations. However, the system was unable to generate optimal plans and had no mechanisms to follow the plan considering realistic trajectories, which is not suited for real-world deployments. In this work, we further investigate the problem by formulating the Multi-Robot Exploration with Communication Constraints and Intermittent Connectivity (MRE-CCIC) problem. We propose a Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP) formulation to generate rendezvous plans and a policy to follow them based on the Rendezvous Tracking for Unknown Scenarios (RTUS) mechanism. The RTUS is a simple rule to allow robots to follow the assigned plan, considering unknown conditions. Finally, we evaluated our method in a large-scale environment configured in Gazebo simulations. The results suggest that our method can follow the plan promptly and accomplish the task efficiently.

Current frameworks tend to prescribe monolithic solutions that are not only prohibitively computationally complex with a scaling cost of $O(n^2)$ but simply do not offer Byzantine fault tolerance. The proposed hierarchical framework presented in this paper tries to eliminate such trade-offs by stratifying a three-layered architecture. We spread the intelligence into three layers: an immediate collision avoiding local layer running on dense graph attention with latency of $<10 ms$, a regional layer using sparse attention with $O(nk)$ computational complexity and asynchronous federated learning with coordinate-wise trimmed mean aggregation, and lastly, a global layer using a lightweight Hashgraph-inspired protocol. We have proposed an adaptive differential privacy mechanism, wherein the noise level $(ε\\in [0.1, 1.0])$ is dynamically reduced based on an evaluation of the measured real-time threat that in turn maximized the privacy-utility tradeoff.

Real-time UE detection has been limited, largely due to the ethical and privacy challenges of obtaining annotated ICU video data. We propose Augmented Unplanned Removal Alert (AURA), a vision-based risk detection system developed and validated entirely on a fully synthetic video dataset. By leveraging text-to-video diffusion, we generated diverse and clinically realistic ICU scenarios capturing a range of patient behaviors and care contexts. The system applies pose estimation to identify two high-risk movement patterns: collision, defined as hand entry into spatial zones near airway tubes, and agitation, quantified by the velocity of tracked anatomical keypoints. Expert assessments confirmed the realism of the synthetic data, and performance evaluations showed high accuracy for collision detection and moderate performance for agitation recognition. This work demonstrates a novel pathway for developing privacy-preserving, reproducible patient safety monitoring systems with potential for deployment in intensive care settings."}

Manually designing questions is time-consuming and often fails to meet diverse learning needs, making automated question generation a crucial approach to reduce teachers' workload and improve the scalability of educational resources. However, most existing question generation methods rely on single-agent or rule-based pipelines, which still produce questions with unstable quality, limited diversity, and insufficient alignment with educational goals. To address these challenges, we propose EduAgentQG, a multi-agent collaborative framework for generating high-quality and diverse personalized questions. The framework consists of five specialized agents and operates through an iterative feedback loop: the Planner generates structured design plans and multiple question directions to enhance diversity; the Writer produces candidate questions based on the plan and optimizes their quality and diversity using feedback from the Solver and Educator; the Solver and Educator perform binary scoring across multiple evaluation dimensions and feed the evaluation results back to the Writer; the Checker conducts final verification, including answer correctness and clarity, ensuring alignment with educational goals. Through this multi-agent collaboration and iterative feedback loop, EduAgentQG generates questions that are both high-quality and diverse, while maintaining consistency with educational objectives. Experiments on two mathematics question datasets demonstrate that EduAgentQG outperforms existing single-agent and multi-agent methods in terms of question diversity, goal consistency, and overall quality."}

We attribute this bottleneck to the agents' excessive reliance on static, internal knowledge within MLLMs, which leads to two critical failure points: 1) strategic hallucinations in high-level planning and 2) operational errors during low-level execution on user interfaces (UI). The core insight of this paper is that high-level planning and low-level UI operations require fundamentally distinct types of knowledge. Planning demands high-level, strategy-oriented experiences, whereas operations necessitate low-level, precise instructions closely tied to specific app UIs. Motivated by these insights, we propose Mobile-Agent-RAG, a novel hierarchical multi-agent framework that innovatively integrates dual-level retrieval augmentation. At the planning stage, we introduce Manager-RAG to reduce strategic hallucinations by retrieving human-validated comprehensive task plans that provide high-level guidance. At the execution stage, we develop Operator-RAG to improve execution accuracy by retrieving the most precise low-level guidance for accurate atomic actions, aligned with the current app and subtask. To accurately deliver these knowledge types, we construct two specialized retrieval-oriented knowledge bases. Furthermore, we introduce Mobile-Eval-RAG, a challenging benchmark for evaluating such agents on realistic multi-app, long-horizon tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mobile-Agent-RAG significantly outperforms SoTA baselines, improving task completion rate by 11.0% and step efficiency by 10.2%, establishing a robust paradigm for context-aware, reliable multi-agent mobile automation."}

Complex driving scenarios contain rich semantic information, yet ambiguous or noisy semantics can compromise decision reliability, while interference between multiple driving tasks may hinder optimal planning. Furthermore, prolonged inference latency slows decision-making, increasing the risk of unsafe driving behaviors. To address these challenges, we propose ExpertAD, a novel framework that enhances the performance of ADS with Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture. We introduce a Perception Adapter (PA) to amplify task-critical features, ensuring contextually relevant scene understanding, and a Mixture of Sparse Experts (MoSE) to minimize task interference during prediction, allowing for effective and efficient planning. Our experiments show that ExpertAD reduces average collision rates by up to 20% and inference latency by 25% compared to prior methods.

We introduce Moral-Reason-QA, a novel dataset extending 680 human-annotated, high-ambiguity moral scenarios with framework-specific reasoning traces across utilitarian, deontological, and virtue ethics, enabling systematic evaluation of moral generalization in realistic decision contexts. Our learning approach employs Group Relative Policy Optimization with composite rewards that simultaneously optimize decision alignment and framework-specific reasoning processes to facilitate learning of the underlying moral frameworks. Experimental results demonstrate successful generalization to unseen moral scenarios, with softmax-normalized alignment scores improving by +0.757 for utilitarian and +0.450 for deontological frameworks when tested on out-of-distribution evaluation sets. The experiments also reveal training challenges and promising directions that inform future research. These findings establish that LLM agents can be systematically trained to internalize and apply specific moral frameworks to novel situations, providing a critical foundation for AI safety as language models become more integrated into human decision-making processes."}

The authors argue students across fields must be taught to responsibly and expertly harness the potential of AI tools to ensure job market readiness and positive outcomes. Computer Science trajectories are particularly impacted, and while consistently top ranked U.S. Computer Science departments teach the mechanisms and frameworks underlying AI, few appear to offer courses on applications for existing generative AI tools. A course was developed at a private research university to teach undergraduate and graduate Computer Science students applications for generative AI tools in software development. Two mixed method surveys indicated students overwhelmingly found the course valuable and effective.

However, a standardized framework for implementing DataOps is lacking. This perspective proposes a qualitative design for a DataOps-aligned validation framework. It introduces a DataOps Controls Scorecard, derived from a multivocal literature review, which distills key concepts into twelve testable controls.

The framework consists of five stages: Lint, Optimize, Parse, Validate, and Observe, each containing specific, automated checks. A Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM) demonstrates how each high-level control is enforced by concrete pipeline checks, ensuring qualitative completeness.

We introduce UpBench, a dynamically evolving benchmark grounded in real jobs drawn from the global Upwork labor marketplace. Each task corresponds to a verified client transaction, anchoring evaluation in genuine work activity and financial outcomes. UpBench employs a rubric-based evaluation framework, in which expert freelancers decompose each job into detailed, verifiable acceptance criteria and assess AI submissions with per-criterion feedback.

Human expertise is integrated throughout the data pipeline (from job curation and rubric construction to evaluation) ensuring fidelity to real professional standards and supporting research on human-AI collaboration.

In large or low-resource courses, instructors often lack the time, staffing, and bandwidth required to review and respond to every student reflection, creating gaps in support precisely where learners would benefit most. This paper presents a theory-grounded system that uses five coordinated role-based LLM agents (Evaluator, Equity Monitor, Metacognitive Coach, Aggregator, and Reflexion Reviewer) to score learner reflections with a shared rubric and to generate short, bias-aware, learner-facing comments. The agents first produce structured rubric scores, then check for potentially biased or exclusionary language, add metacognitive prompts that invite students to think about their own thinking, and finally compose a concise feedback message of at most 120 words. The system includes simple fairness checks that compare scoring error across lower and higher scoring learners, enabling instructors to monitor and bound disparities in accuracy. We evaluate the pipeline in a 12-session AI literacy program with adult learners. In this setting, the system produces rubric scores that approach expert-level agreement, and trained graders rate the AI-generated comments as helpful, empathetic, and well aligned with instructional goals. Taken together, these results show that multi-agent LLM systems can deliver equitable, high-quality formative feedback at a scale and speed that would be impossible for human graders alone. More broadly, the work points toward a future where feedback-rich learning becomes feasible for any course size or context, advancing long-standing goals of equity, access, and instructional capacity in education."}

This is further enriched with accompanying pedagogical changes, such as strengthened asynchronous learning, and the use of AI (from ChatGPT and all other similar tools that followed) and other technologies to aid learning. While these educational transformations have enabled flexibility in learning and resource access, they have also exposed new challenges on how students can construct successful learning in hybrid learning environments. In this paper, we investigate the interaction between different dimensions of student learning experiences (ranging from perceived acceptance of teaching methods and staff support/feedback to learning pressure and student motivation) and academic achievement within the context of postgraduate blended learning in UK universities. To achieve this, we employed a combination of several data analytics techniques including visualization, statistical tests, regression analysis, and latent profile analysis. Our empirical results (based on a survey of 255 postgraduate students and holistically interpreted via the Community of Inquiry (CoI) framework) demonstrated that learning activities combining teaching and social presences, and tailored academic support through effective feedback are critical elements for successful postgraduate experience in blended learning contexts. Regarding contributions, this research advances the understanding of student success by identifying the various ways demographic, experiential, and psychological factors impact academic outcomes. And in theoretical terms, it contributes to the extension of the CoI framework by integrating the concept of learner heterogeneity and identifying four distinct student profiles based on how they engage in the different CoI presences."}

I perform a synthetic experiment on a wide range of models from most major model providers using Jonathan Haidt's influential moral foundations theory (MFT) to elicit diverse value judgments from LLMs. Using multiple descriptive statistical approaches, I document the bias and variance of large language model responses relative to a human baseline in the original survey. My results suggest that models rely on different moral foundations from one another and from a nationally representative human baseline, and these differences increase as model capabilities increase. This work seeks to spur further analysis of LLMs using MFT, including finetuning of open-source models, and greater deliberation by policymakers on the importance of moral foundations for LLM alignment."}

The intruders' objective is to breach the target perimeter without being captured by the defender, while the defender's goal is to capture as many intruders as possible. After one intruder breaches or is captured, the next appears randomly on a fixed circle surrounding the target. Therefore, the defender's final position in one game becomes its starting position for the next. We divide an intruder-defender engagement into two phases, partial information and full information, depending on the information available to the players. We address the capturability of an intruder by the defender using the notions of Dubins path and guarding arc. We quantify the percentage of capture for both finite and infinite sequences of incoming intruders. Finally, the theoretical results are verified through numerical examples using Monte-Carlo-type random trials of experiments."}

Despite these successes, existing methods mainly focus on single-domain RL (e.g., mathematics) with verifiable rewards (RLVR), and their reliance on purely online RL frameworks restricts the exploration space, thereby limiting reasoning performance. In this paper, we address these limitations by leveraging rubrics to provide both fine-grained reward signals and offline guidance. We propose $\\textbf{RGR-GRPO}$ (Reward and Guidance through Rubrics), a rubric-driven RL framework for multi-domain reasoning. RGR-GRPO enables LLMs to receive dense and informative rewards while exploring a larger solution space during GRPO training.

Among its implementations in robotic manipulation, Diffusion Policy (DP), with its two variants DP-CNN (DP-C) and DP-Transformer (DP-T), is one of the most effective and widely adopted models, demonstrating the advantages of predicting continuous action sequences. However, both DP and other BC methods remain constrained by the scarcity of paired training data, and the internal mechanisms underlying DP's effectiveness remain insufficiently understood, leading to limited generalization and a lack of principled design in model development. In this work, we propose a decoupled training recipe that leverages nearly cost-free kinematics-generated trajectories as observation-free data to pretrain a general action head (action generator). The pretrained action head is then frozen and adapted to novel tasks through feature modulation. Our experiments demonstrate the feasibility of this approach in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios. As an additional benefit, decoupling improves training efficiency; for instance, DP-C achieves up to a 41% speedup. Furthermore, the confinement of task-specific knowledge to the conditioning components under decoupling, combined with the near-identical performance of DP-C in both normal and decoupled training, indicates that the action generation backbone plays a limited role in robotic manipulation. Motivated by this observation, we introduce DP-MLP, which replaces the 244M-parameter U-Net backbone of DP-C with only 4M parameters of simple MLP blocks, achieving a 83.9% faster training speed under normal training and 89.1% under decoupling."}

Accepted at the 40th Annual AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2026)", "summary": "Despite the explosive growth of AI and the technologies built upon it, predicting and inferring the sub-optimal behavior of users or human collaborators remains a critical challenge. In many cases, such behaviors are not a result of irrationality, but rather a rational decision made given inherent cognitive bounds and biased beliefs about the world. In this paper, we formally introduce a class of computational-rational (CR) user models for cognitively-bounded agents acting optimally under biased beliefs. The key novelty lies in explicitly modeling how a bounded memory process leads to a dynamically inconsistent and biased belief state and, consequently, sub-optimal sequential decision-making. We address the challenge of identifying the latent user-specific bound and inferring biased belief states from passive observations on the fly. We argue that for our formalized CR model family with an explicit and parameterized cognitive process, this challenge is tractable. To support our claim, we propose an efficient online inference method based on nested particle filtering that simultaneously tracks the user's latent belief state and estimates the unknown cognitive bound from a stream of observed actions. We validate our approach in a representative navigation task using memory decay as an example of a cognitive bound. With simulations, we show that (1) our CR model generates intuitively plausible behaviors corresponding to different levels of memory capacity, and (2) our inference method accurately and efficiently recovers the ground-truth cognitive bounds from limited observations ($\\le 100$ steps). We further demonstrate how this approach provides a principled foundation for developing adaptive AI assistants, enabling adaptive assistance that accounts for the user's memory limitations."}

Model-based control approaches typically do not account for such uncertainty in the hybrid dynamics, while standard model-free RL methods fail to account for abrupt mode switches, leading to poor generalization.\n  To overcome this, we propose SAC-MoE which models the actor of the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) framework as a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with a learned router that adaptively selects among learned experts. To further improve robustness, we develop a curriculum-based training algorithm to prioritize data collection in challenging settings, allowing better generalization to unseen modes and switching locations. Simulation studies in hybrid autonomous racing and legged locomotion tasks show that SAC-MoE outperforms baselines (up to 6x) in zero-shot generalization to unseen environments.

This study investigates whether advanced LLMs behave as rational agents or whether they reproduce human behavioural tendencies when faced with classic decision problems. Using two canonical experiments in behavioural economics, the ultimatum game and a gambling game, we elicit decisions from two state of the art models, Google Gemma7B and Qwen, under neutral and gender conditioned prompts. We estimate parameters of inequity aversion and loss-aversion and compare them with human benchmarks. The models display attenuated but persistent deviations from rationality, including moderate fairness concerns, mild loss aversion, and subtle gender conditioned differences."}

Existing methods for incorporating such advice typically assume static and known suggester quality parameters, limiting practical deployment. We introduce a framework that dynamically learns and adapts to varying suggester reliability in partially observable environments. First, we integrate suggester quality directly into the agent's belief representation, enabling agents to infer and adjust their reliance on suggestions through Bayesian inference over suggester types. Second, we introduce an explicit ``ask'' action allowing agents to strategically request suggestions at critical moments, balancing informational gains against acquisition costs. Experimental evaluation demonstrates robust performance across varying suggester qualities, adaptation to changing reliability, and strategic management of suggestion requests. This work provides a foundation for adaptive human-agent collaboration by addressing suggestion uncertainty in uncertain environments."}

However, existing models struggle to accurately translate low-level actions (e.g., joint positions) into precise robotic movements in predicted frames, leading to inconsistencies with real-world physical interactions. To address these limitations, we propose MTV-World, an embodied world model that introduces Multi-view Trajectory-Video control for precise visuomotor prediction. Specifically, instead of directly using low-level actions for control, we employ trajectory videos obtained through camera intrinsic and extrinsic parameters and Cartesian-space transformation as control signals. However, projecting 3D raw actions onto 2D images inevitably causes a loss of spatial information, making a single view insufficient for accurate interaction modeling. To overcome this, we introduce a multi-view framework that compensates for spatial information loss and ensures high-consistency with physical world. MTV-World forecasts future frames based on multi-view trajectory videos as input and conditioning on an initial frame per view. Furthermore, to systematically evaluate both robotic motion precision and object interaction accuracy, we develop an auto-evaluation pipeline leveraging multimodal large models and referring video object segmentation models. To measure spatial consistency, we formulate it as an object location matching problem and adopt the Jaccard Index as the evaluation metric. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MTV-World achieves precise control execution and accurate physical interaction modeling in complex dual-arm scenarios."}

We implement and analyze MAML-TRPO's ability to learn a universal initialization that facilitates few-shot adaptation across semantically different manipulation behaviors including pushing, picking, and drawer manipulation. Our experiments demonstrate that MAML achieves effective one-shot adaptation with clear performance improvements after a single gradient update, reaching final success rates of 21.0% on training tasks and 13.2% on held-out test tasks.

However, traditional teleoperation systems rely on inverse kinematics (IK) solvers and hand-tuned PD controllers, which struggle to handle external forces, adapt to different users, and produce natural motions under dynamic conditions. In this work, we propose a learning-based neural teleoperation framework that replaces the conventional IK+PD pipeline with learned policies trained via reinforcement learning. Our approach learns to directly map VR controller inputs to robot joint commands while implicitly handling force disturbances, producing smooth trajectories, and adapting to user preferences. We train our policies in simulation using demonstrations collected from IK-based teleoperation as initialization, then fine-tune them with force randomization and trajectory smoothness rewards. Experiments on the Unitree G1 humanoid robot demonstrate that our learned policies achieve 34% lower tracking error, 45% smoother motions, and superior force adaptation compared to the IK baseline, while maintaining real-time performance (50Hz control frequency). We validate our approach on manipulation tasks including object pick-and-place, door opening, and bimanual coordination. These results suggest that learning-based approaches can significantly improve the naturalness and robustness of humanoid teleoperation systems."}

However, such datasets remain scarce, limiting progress in both research and applications. To address this, this paper presents a protocol for multimodal dataset collection designed to reflect social anxiety in a human-robot interaction context. The dataset will consist of synchronised audio, video, and physiological recordings acquired from at least 70 participants, grouped according to their level of social anxiety, as they engage in approximately 10-minute interactive Wizard-of-Oz role-play scenarios with the Furhat social robot under controlled experimental conditions. In addition to multimodal data, the dataset will be enriched with contextual data providing deeper insight into individual variability in social anxiety responses.

Both model-free and model-based control strategies demonstrate up to 76% reduction in misinformation propagation across diverse network configurations, validated through simulations using the LIAR2 dataset with sentiment features extracted via large language models.

Our analysis shows that under sufficient coverage condition of the offline data, the policy is recursively feasible and admits provable, bounded optimality gap. These conditions establish an explicit trade-off between the amount of data collected and the tightness of the bounds.

We investigate temporal, demographic, and geographical patterns in the advertising strategies of major Australian political actors to establish an empirical evidence base, and interpret these findings through the lens of Social Identity Theory (SIT). Our findings not only reveal significant disparities in spending and reach among parties, but also in persuasion strategies being deployed in targeted online campaigns. We observe a marked increase in advertising activity as the election approached, peaking just before the mandated media blackout period. Demographic analysis shows distinct targeting strategies, with parties focusing more on younger demographics and exhibiting gender-based differences in ad impressions. Regional distribution of ads largely mirrored population densities, with some parties employing more targeted approaches in specific states. Moreover, we found that parties emphasized different themes aligned with their ideologies-major parties focused on party names and opponents, while smaller parties emphasized issue-specific messages. Drawing on SIT, we interpret these findings within Australia's compulsory voting context, suggesting that parties employed distinct persuasion strategies. With turnout guaranteed, major parties focused on reinforcing partisan identities to prevent voter defection, while smaller parties cultivated issue-based identities to capture the support of disaffected voters who are obligated to participate."}

In this setting, perfect tracking or rejection is achieved by constructing a zero-regulation-error manifold π(w) and a feedforward input c(w) that render such manifold invariant. The pair (π(w), c(w)) is characterized by the regulator equations, i.e., a system of PDEs with an algebraic constraint. We focus on accurately solving the regulator equations introducing a physics-informed neural network (PINN) approach that directly approximates π(w) and c(w) by minimizing the residuals under boundary and feasibility conditions, without requiring precomputed trajectories or labeled data. The learned operator maps exosystem states to steady state plant states and inputs, enables real-time inference and, critically, generalizes across families of the exosystem with varying initial conditions and parameters. The framework is validated on a regulation task that synchronizes a helicopter's vertical dynamics with a harmonically oscillating platform. The resulting PINN-based solver reconstructs the zero-error manifold with high fidelity and sustains regulation performance under exosystem variations, highlighting the potential of learning-enabled solvers for nonlinear output regulation.

The proposed framework integrates natural-language inputs from users and Bayesian estimators of the environment into adaptive safety certificates that explicitly account for user preferences, system dynamics, and quantified uncertainties.

Precision grasping enables tool use and is believed to have influenced human evolution. Today's multi-fingered robotic hands are effective in power grasps, but for tasks requiring precision, parallel grippers are still more widely adopted. This contrast highlights a key limitation in current robotic hand design: the difficulty of achieving both stable power grasps and precise, fine-grained manipulation within a single, versatile system. In this work, we bridge this gap by jointly optimizing the control and hardware design of a multi-fingered dexterous hand, enabling both power and precision manipulation. Rather than redesigning the entire hand, we introduce a lightweight fingertip geometry modification, represent it as a contact plane, and jointly optimize its parameters along with the corresponding control. Our control strategy dynamically switches between power and precision manipulation and simplifies precision control into parallel thumb-index motions, which proves robust for sim-to-real transfer. On the design side, we leverage large-scale simulation to optimize the fingertip geometry using a differentiable neural-physics surrogate model. We validate our approach through extensive experiments in both sim-to-real and real-to-real settings. Our method achieves an 82.5% zero-shot success rate on unseen objects in sim-to-real precision grasping, and a 93.3% success rate in challenging real-world tasks involving bread pinching.

Achieving these capabilities requires a cohesive understanding of the environment, including object recognition to localize target objects, object affordances to identify potential interaction areas and spatial affordances to discern optimal areas for both object placement and robot movement. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at high-level task planning and scene understanding, they often struggle to infer actionable positions for physical interaction, such as functional grasping points and permissible placement regions. This limitation stems from the lack of fine-grained annotations for object and spatial affordances in their training datasets. To tackle this challenge, we introduce RoboAfford++, a generative AI-enhanced dataset for multimodal affordance learning for both robotic manipulation and navigation. Our dataset comprises 869,987 images paired with 2.0 million question answering (QA) annotations, covering three critical tasks: object affordance recognition to identify target objects based on attributes and spatial relationships, object affordance prediction to pinpoint functional parts for manipulation, and spatial affordance localization to identify free space for object placement and robot navigation. Complementing this dataset, we propose RoboAfford-Eval, a comprehensive benchmark for assessing affordance-aware prediction in real-world scenarios, featuring 338 meticulously annotated samples across the same three tasks. Extensive experimental results reveal the deficiencies of existing VLMs in affordance learning, while fine-tuning on the RoboAfford++ dataset significantly enhances their ability to reason about object and spatial affordances, validating the dataset's effectiveness."}

It requires foresight to minimize overall changes to the clutter configuration while accessing target objects, avoiding stack destabilization and reducing the number of object removals required. Rule-based planners when applied to this problem, rely on rigid heuristics, leading to high computational overhead. End-to-end reinforcement learning approaches struggle with interpretability and generalizability over different conditions. To address these issues, we present ClutterNav, a novel decision-making framework that can identify the next best object to be removed so as to access a target object in a given clutter, while minimising stack disturbances. ClutterNav formulates the problem as a continuous reinforcement learning task, where each object removal dynamically updates the understanding of the scene. A removability critic, trained from demonstrations, estimates the cost of removing any given object based on geometric and spatial features. This learned cost is complemented by integrated gradients that assess how the presence or removal of surrounding objects influences the accessibility of the target. By dynamically prioritizing actions that balance immediate removability against long-term target exposure, ClutterNav achieves near human-like strategic sequencing, without predefined heuristics. The proposed approach is validated extensively in simulation and over real-world experiments. The results demonstrate real-time, occlusion-aware decision-making in partially observable environments."}

To address this challenge, this paper proposes the ADN-Agent architecture, which leverages a general large language model (LLM) to coordinate multiple DSMs, enabling adaptive intent recognition, task decomposition, and DSM invocation. Within the ADN-Agent, we design a novel communication mechanism that provides a unified and flexible interface for diverse heterogeneous DSMs. Finally, for some language-intensive subtasks, we propose an automated training pipeline for fine-tuning small language models, thereby effectively enhancing the overall problem-solving capability of the system. Comprehensive comparisons and ablation experiments validate the efficacy of the proposed method and demonstrate that the ADN-Agent architecture outperforms existing LLM application paradigms."}

While they can produce reasoning-like content via methods such as chain-of-thought prompting, these outputs are typically unstructured and informal, obscuring whether models truly understand the fundamental reasoning paradigms that underpin scientific inference. To address this, we introduce a novel task named Latent Reasoning Chain Extraction (ARCHE), in which models must decompose complex reasoning arguments into combinations of standard reasoning paradigms in the form of a Reasoning Logic Tree (RLT). In RLT, all reasoning steps are explicitly categorized as one of three variants of Peirce's fundamental inference modes: deduction, induction, or abduction. To facilitate this task, we release ARCHE Bench, a new benchmark derived from 70 Nature Communications articles, including more than 1,900 references and 38,000 viewpoints. We propose two logic-aware evaluation metrics: Entity Coverage (EC) for content completeness and Reasoning Edge Accuracy (REA) for step-by-step logical validity. Evaluations on 10 leading LLMs on ARCHE Bench reveal that models exhibit a trade-off between REA and EC, and none are yet able to extract a complete and standard reasoning chain. These findings highlight a substantial gap between the abilities of current reasoning models and the rigor required for scientific argumentation."}

Traditional methods such as manual inspection and blanket pesticide spraying often lead to excessive chemical use, resource waste, and environmental impact. While unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) offer a promising platform for precision agriculture through targeted spraying and improved operational efficiency, existing UAV-based approaches remain limited by battery life, payload capacity, and scalability, especially in large fields where single-UAV or uniformly distributed spraying is insufficient. Although multi-UAV coordination has been explored, many current frameworks still assume uniform spraying and do not account for infestation severity, UAV dynamics, non-uniform resource allocation, or energy-efficient coordination.\n  To address these limitations, this paper proposes a Density-Driven Optimal Control (D2OC) framework that integrates Optimal Transport (OT) theory with multi-UAV coverage control for large-scale agricultural spraying. The method supports non-uniform, priority-aware resource allocation based on infestation intensity, reducing unnecessary chemical application. UAVs are modeled as a linear time-varying (LTV) system to capture variations in mass and inertia during spraying missions. The D2OC control law, derived using Lagrangian mechanics, enables efficient coordination, balanced workload distribution, and improved mission duration. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms uniform spraying and Spectral Multiscale Coverage (SMC) in coverage efficiency, chemical reduction, and operational sustainability, providing a scalable solution for smart agriculture."}

Scree habitats, hosting unique and often endangered species, face severe threats from climate change due to their high-altitude nature. Traditionally, their monitoring has required highly skilled scientists to conduct extensive fieldwork in remote, potentially hazardous locations, making the process resource-intensive and time-consuming. This paper presents a novel approach for scree habitat monitoring using a legged robot to assist botanists in data collection and species identification. Specifically, we deployed the ANYmal C robot in the Italian Alpine bio-region in two field campaigns spanning two years and leveraged deep learning to detect and classify key plant species of interest. Our results demonstrate that agile legged robots can navigate challenging terrains and increase the frequency and efficiency of scree monitoring. When paired with traditional phytosociological surveys performed by botanists, this robotics-assisted protocol not only streamlines field operations but also enhances data acquisition, storage, and usage. The outcomes of this research contribute to the evolving landscape of robotics in environmental science, paving the way for a more comprehensive and sustainable approach to habitat monitoring and preservation."}

To this end, we propose PCRS-TKA, a prompt-based framework employing retrieval-augmented generation to integrate PLMs with KGs. PCRS-TKA constructs dialogue-specific knowledge trees from KGs and serializes them into texts, enabling structure-aware reasoning while capturing rich entity semantics. Our approach selectively filters context-relevant knowledge and explicitly models collaborative preferences using specialized supervision signals.

We show how to use them to solve Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) explicitly discretized on a computational stencil. From this point of view, the QPU serves as a sampling accelerator. Each micro-kernel consumes only stencil inputs (neighbor values and coefficients), runs a shallow parameterized circuit, and reports the sample mean of a readout rule. The resource footprint in qubits and depth is fixed and independent of the global grid. This makes micro-kernels easy to orchestrate from a classical host and to parallelize across grid points. We present two realizations. The Bernoulli micro-kernel targets convex-sum stencils by encoding values as single-qubit probabilities with shot allocation proportional to stencil weights. The branching micro-kernel prepares a selector over stencil branches and applies addressed rotations to a single readout qubit. In contrast to monolithic quantum PDE solvers that encode the full space-time problem in one deep circuit, our approach keeps the classical time loop and offloads only local updates. Batching and in-circuit fusion amortize submission and readout overheads. We test and validate the QPU micro-kernel method on two PDEs commonly arising in scientific computing: the Heat and viscous Burgers' equations. On noiseless quantum circuit simulators, accuracy improves as the number of samples increases. On the IBM Brisbane quantum computer, single-step diffusion tests show lower errors for the Bernoulli realization than for branching at equal shot budgets, with QPU micro-kernel execution dominating the wall time."}

The algorithm models energy consumption based on the drone propulsion system and flight dynamics. We conduct extensive evaluations, comparing EcoFlight with direct-flight and shortest-distance schemes.

In view of this, we propose Segmented Exponent Alignment (SEA) and Dynamic Wordline Activation (DWA) strategies. SEA exploits the observation that input exponents are often clustered around zero or within a narrow range. By segmenting the exponent space and aligning mantissas accordingly, SEA eliminates the need for maximum exponent detection and reduces input mantissa shifting, and thus reduces the processing latency. DWA further reduces latency and maintains accuracy by activating wordlines based on the exponent segments defined by SEA. Simulation results demonstrate that, when compared with conventional comparison tree based maximum exponent alignment method, our approach saves 63.8\\% power consumption, and achieves a 40.87\\% delay reduction on the VGG16-CIFAR10 benchmark."}

A 2R manipulator tracking a circular end-effector path is first examined because this case has a known analytical optimum: equal link lengths and the second joint orthogonal to the first. This serves as a validation step to test whether RL can rediscover the optimum using reward feedback alone, without access to the manipulability expression or the Jacobian. Three RL algorithms (SAC, DDPG, and PPO) are compared with grid search and black-box optimizers, with morphology represented by a single action parameter phi that maps to the link lengths. All methods converge to the analytical solution, showing that numerical recovery of the optimum is possible without supplying analytical structure.\n  Most morphology design tasks have no closed-form solutions, and grid or heuristic search becomes expensive as dimensionality increases. RL is therefore explored as a scalable alternative. The formulation used for the circular path is extended to elliptical and rectangular paths by expanding the action space to the full morphology vector (L1, L2, theta2). In these non-analytical settings, RL continues to converge reliably, whereas grid and black-box methods require far larger evaluation budgets. These results indicate that RL is effective for both recovering known optima and solving morphology optimization problems without analytical solutions."}

Satellites moving along distinct orbital planes yield phase shifted ground tracks and heterogeneous, time varying coverage patterns that significantly complicate the optimization.To bridge the gap, we propose a dynamic visibility aware multi orbit satellite selection framework which can determine the optimal serving satellites across orbital layers. The framework is built upon Markov approximation and matching game theory. Specifically, we formulate a combinatorial optimization problem that maximizes the sum rate under per satellite power budgets. The problem is NP hard , combining discrete user association (UA) decisions with continuous power allocation, and an inherently non convex sum rate maximization objective. We address it through a problem specific Markov approximation. Moreover, we alternately solve UA or bandwidth allocation via a matching game and power allocation via a Lagrangian dual program, which together form a block coordinate descent method tailored to this problem. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm converges to a suboptimal solution across all scenarios. Extensive experiments against four state of the art baselines further demonstrate that our algorithm achieves, on average, approximately 7.85% higher sum rate than the best performing baseline."}

In human-agent teams, artificial agents need to adapt to their human partners in real time, as individuals often have unique preferences and policies that may change dynamically throughout interactions.

In this work, we introduce a strategy-conditioned cooperator framework that learns to represent, categorize, and adapt to a broad range of potential partner strategies in real-time. Our approach encodes strategies with a variational autoencoder to learn a latent strategy space from agent trajectory data, identifies distinct strategy types through clustering, and trains a cooperator agent conditioned on these clusters by generating partners of each strategy type. For online adaptation to novel partners, we leverage a fixed-share regret minimization algorithm that dynamically infers and adjusts the partner's strategy estimation during interaction. We evaluate our method in a modified version of the Overcooked domain, a complex collaborative cooking environment that requires effective coordination among two players with a diverse potential strategy space. Through these experiments and an online user study, we demonstrate that our proposed agent achieves state of the art performance compared to existing baselines when paired with novel human, and agent teammates."}

Typical DA strategies in the literature include collecting additional data in the target domain or re-training the model, or both. Both these strategies quickly become impractical as we increase scale and complexity of driving. These limitations have encouraged investigation into few-shot and zero-shot prompt-driven DA at inference time involving LLMs and VLMs. These methods work by adding a few state-action trajectories during inference to the prompt (similar to in-context learning). However, there are two limitations of such an approach: $(i)$ prompt-driven DA methods are currently restricted to perception tasks such as detection and segmentation and $(ii)$ they require expert few-shot data. In this work, we present a new approach to inference-time few-shot prompt-driven DA for closed-loop autonomous driving in adverse weather condition using in-context reinforcement learning (ICRL). Similar to other prompt-driven DA methods, our approach does not require any updates to the model parameters nor does it require additional data collection in adversarial weather regime. Furthermore, our approach advances the state-of-the-art in prompt-driven DA by extending to closed driving using general trajectories observed during inference. Our experiments using the CARLA simulator show that ICRL results in safer, more efficient, and more comfortable driving policies in the target domain compared to state-of-the-art prompt-driven DA baselines."}

Existing uniform coverage strategies are insufficient for realistic applications, and many non-uniform approaches either lack optimality guarantees or fail to incorporate crucial real-world constraints such as agent dynamics, limited operation time, the number of agents, and decentralized execution.\n  To resolve these limitations, we propose a novel framework called Density-Driven Optimal Control (D2OC). The central idea of D2OC is the integration of optimal transport theory with multi-agent coverage control, enabling each agent to continuously adjust its trajectory to match a mission-specific reference density map. The proposed formulation establishes optimality by solving a constrained optimization problem that explicitly incorporates physical and operational constraints. The resulting control input is analytically derived from the Lagrangian of the objective function, yielding closed-form optimal solutions for linear systems and a generalizable structure for nonlinear systems. Furthermore, a decentralized data-sharing mechanism is developed to coordinate agents without reliance on global information.\n  Comprehensive simulation studies demonstrate that D2OC achieves significantly improved non-uniform area coverage performance compared to existing methods, while maintaining scalability and decentralized implementability."}

Optimal foraging means following the Marginal Value Theorem (MVT), in which individuals exploit a patch of semantically related concepts until it becomes less rewarding and then switch to a new cluster. While human behavioral data suggests foraging-like patterns in semantic fluency tasks, it remains unclear whether modern high-dimensional embedding spaces provide representations that allow algorithms to match observed human behavior. Using state-of-the-art embeddings and prior semantic fluency data, I find that random walks on these embedding spaces produce results consistent with optimal foraging and the MVT. Surprisingly, introducing Metropolis-Hastings sampling, an adaptive algorithm expected to model strategic acceptance and rejection of new clusters, does not produce results consistent with human behavior. These findings challenge the assumption that more complex sampling mechanisms inherently lead to better cognitive models of memory retrieval. Instead, they show that appropriately structured embeddings, even with simple sampling, can produce near-optimal foraging dynamics. This supports the perspective of Hills (2012) rather than Abbott (2015), demonstrating that modern embeddings can approximate human memory foraging without relying on complex acceptance criteria."}

Nav (Dead-End Recovery-aware Navigation), a novel approach to autonomous navigation in scenarios where dead-end detection and recovery are critical, particularly in unstructured environments where robots must handle corners, vegetation occlusions, and blocked junctions. DR. Nav introduces a proactive strategy for navigation in unmapped environments without prior assumptions. Our method unifies dead-end prediction and recovery by generating a single, continuous, real-time semantic cost map. Specifically, DR. Nav leverages cross-modal RGB-LiDAR fusion with attention-based filtering to estimate per-cell dead-end likelihoods and recovery points, which are continuously updated through Bayesian inference to enhance robustness. Unlike prior mapping methods that only encode traversability, DR. Nav explicitly incorporates recovery-aware risk into the navigation cost map, enabling robots to anticipate unsafe regions and plan safer alternative trajectories. We evaluate DR. Nav across multiple dense indoor and outdoor scenarios and demonstrate an increase of 83.33% in accuracy in detection, a 52.4% reduction in time-to-goal (path efficiency), compared to state-of-the-art planners such as DWA, MPPI, and Nav2 DWB.

In the proposed setting, two optical satellites and one Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite operate cooperatively in low Earth orbit to capture ground targets and manage their limited onboard resources efficiently. Traditional optimization methods struggle to handle the real-time, uncertain, and decentralized nature of EO operations, motivating the use of RL and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) for adaptive decision-making. This study systematically formulates the optimization problem from single-satellite to multi-satellite scenarios, addressing key challenges including energy and memory constraints, partial observability, and agent heterogeneity arising from diverse payload capabilities. Using a near-realistic simulation environment built on the Basilisk and BSK-RL frameworks, we evaluate the performance and stability of state-of-the-art MARL algorithms such as MAPPO, HAPPO, and HATRPO. Results show that MARL enables effective coordination across heterogeneous satellites, balancing imaging performance and resource utilization while mitigating non-stationarity and inter-agent reward coupling. The findings provide practical insights into scalable, autonomous satellite operations and contribute a foundation for future research on intelligent EO mission planning under heterogeneous and dynamic conditions."}

Previous methods tried to solve this problem by actively gathering multiple views before grasp pose generation. However, they either overlooked the importance of the grasp distribution for information gain estimation or relied on the projection of the grasp distribution, which ignores the structure of grasp poses on the SE(3) manifold. To tackle these challenges, we propose a calibrated energy-based model for grasp pose generation and an active view selection method that estimates information gain from grasp distribution. Our energy-based model captures the multi-modality nature of grasp distribution on the SE(3) manifold. The energy level is calibrated to the success rate of grasps so that the predicted distribution aligns with the real distribution. The next best view is selected by estimating the information gain for grasp from the calibrated distribution conditioned on the reconstructed environment, which could efficiently drive the robot to explore affordable parts of the target object. Experiments on simulated environments and real robot setups demonstrate that our model could successfully grasp objects in a cluttered environment with limited view budgets compared to previous state-of-the-art models. Our simulated environment can serve as a reproducible platform for future research on active grasping. The source code of our paper will be made public when the paper is released to the public."}

Through theoretical synthesis and framework design, P2P Teaching demonstrates how deliberate disconnection and ethical fading can restore the learner's agency, ensuring that technological tools enhance rather than replace developmental effort.

Any interference with this fundamental right requires a legal basis, which has existed for many years for traditional communication services in the form of telecommunications surveillance (TKÜ, § 100a StPO) and appears to be widely accepted by society. The basis for the implementation of TKÜ is the obligation of telecommunications providers to provide interception interfaces. However, the technical implementation of telecommunications has changed significantly as a result of the Internet. Messenger services and Voice over IP telephony are increasingly competing with traditional telephone services. The use of strong end-to-end encryption made possible by this technology is increasingly posing problems for law enforcement agencies, as only cryptographically encrypted content is accessible via the interception interfaces provided to date. Against the backdrop of current discussions on socalled ``chat control'' and its limited social acceptance, this article addresses the question of whether and, if so, how the cooperation obligations of the technical actors involved can be sensibly regulated in the case of encrypted communication."}

We train classifiers to predict levels of agent performance (optimal, sub-optimal, or worst-case) from windows of preprocessed fNIRS feature vectors, achieving an average F1 score of 67% for binary classification and 46% for multi-class models averaged across conditions and domains. We also train regressors to predict the degree of deviation between an agent's chosen action and a set of near-optimal policies, providing a continuous measure of performance.

However, imitation learning of interactive policies that coordinate with humans in shared spaces without explicit communication remains challenging, due to the significantly higher behavioral complexity in multi-agent interactions compared to non-interactive tasks. In this work, we introduce a structured imitation learning framework for interactive policies by combining generative single-agent policy learning with a flexible yet expressive game-theoretic structure. Our method explicitly separates learning into two steps: first, we learn individual behavioral patterns from multi-agent demonstrations using standard imitation learning; then, we structurally learn inter-agent dependencies by solving an inverse game problem. Preliminary results in a synthetic 5-agent social navigation task show that our method significantly improves non-interactive policies and performs comparably to the ground truth interactive policy using only 50 demonstrations. These results highlight the potential of structured imitation learning in interactive settings."}

The RM is constrained within a confidence set derived from preference data to ensure reliable exploitation. Our iterative online algorithm actively collects preference data through guided exploration of the evolving policy, enabling continual self-improvement of both the policy and the RM.

LAMP follows a Think-Speak-Decide pipeline: (1) Think interprets numerical observations to extract short-term shocks and long-term trends, caching high-value reasoning trajectories; (2) Speak crafts and exchanges strategic messages based on reasoning, updating beliefs by parsing peer communications; and (3) Decide fuses numerical data, reasoning, and reflections into a MARL policy to optimize language-augmented decision-making.

However, existing models struggle to accurately translate low-level actions (e.g., joint positions) into precise robotic movements in predicted frames, leading to inconsistencies with real-world physical interactions. To address these limitations, we propose MTV-World, an embodied world model that introduces Multi-view Trajectory-Video control for precise visuomotor prediction. Specifically, instead of directly using low-level actions for control, we employ trajectory videos obtained through camera intrinsic and extrinsic parameters and Cartesian-space transformation as control signals. However, projecting 3D raw actions onto 2D images inevitably causes a loss of spatial information, making a single view insufficient for accurate interaction modeling. To overcome this, we introduce a multi-view framework that compensates for spatial information loss and ensures high-consistency with physical world. MTV-World forecasts future frames based on multi-view trajectory videos as input and conditioning on an initial frame per view. Furthermore, to systematically evaluate both robotic motion precision and object interaction accuracy, we develop an auto-evaluation pipeline leveraging multimodal large models and referring video object segmentation models. To measure spatial consistency, we formulate it as an object location matching problem and adopt the Jaccard Index as the evaluation metric. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MTV-World achieves precise control execution and accurate physical interaction modeling in complex dual-arm scenarios."}

To enhance coverage, UAVs employ movable antennas (MAs), while reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) on surviving high-rises redirect signals. The key challenge is communication-limited partial observability, leaving each UAV with a narrow, fast-changing neighborhood view that destabilizes value estimation. Existing multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approaches are inadequate--non-communication methods rely on unavailable global critics, heuristic sharing is brittle and redundant, and learnable protocols (e.g., CommNet, DIAL) lose per-neighbor structure and aggravate non-stationarity under tight bandwidth. To address partial observability, we propose a spatiotemporal A2C where each UAV transmits prior-decision messages with local state, a compact policy fingerprint, and a recurrent belief, encoded per neighbor and concatenated. A spatial discount shapes value targets to emphasize local interactions, while analysis under one-hop-per-slot latency explains stable training with delayed views. Experimental results show our policy outperforms IA2C, ConseNet, FPrint, DIAL, and CommNet--achieving faster convergence, higher asymptotic reward, reduced Temporal-Difference(TD)/advantage errors, and a better communication throughput-energy trade-off."}

Capturing the complete degree-of-freedom of force is imperative for accurate force measurement with six-axis force/torque sensors.

In this paper, a soft air-chamber type six-axis force/torque sensor with 16-channel barometers is introduced, which housed in hyper-elastic air chambers made of silicone rubber. Additionally, an effective decoupling method is proposed, based on a rigid-soft hierarchical structure, which reduces the six-axis decoupling problem to two three-axis decoupling problems. Finite element model simulation and experiments demonstrate the compatibility of the proposed approach with reality. The prototype's sensing performance is quantitatively measured in terms of static load response, dynamic load response and dynamic response characteristic.

Most high-performance control approaches for DWR explicitly utilize the linear and angular velocities of the trajectory as control references. However, existing research on time-optimal path parameterization (TOPP) for mobile robots usually neglects the angular velocity and joint vel- ocity constraints, which can result in degraded control perfor- mance in practical applications. In this article, a systematic and practical TOPP algorithm named TOPP-DWR is proposed for DWR and other mobile robots. First, the non-uniform B-spline is adopted to represent the initial trajectory in the task space. Second, the piecewise-constant angular velocity, as well as joint velocity, linear velocity, and linear acceleration constraints, are incorporated into the TOPP problem. During the construction of the optimization problem, the aforementioned constraints are uniformly represented as linear velocity constraints. To boost the numerical computational efficiency, we introduce a slack variable to reformulate the problem into second-order-cone programming (SOCP). Subsequently, comparative experiments are conducted to validate the superiority of the proposed method. Quantitative performance indexes show that TOPP-DWR achieves TOPP while adhering to all constraints. Finally, field autonomous navigation experiments are carried out to validate the practicability of TOPP-DWR in real-world applications."}

Concurrently, data acquisition and realtime system state monitoring are becoming more available for control centers. This motivates shifting from \\textit{model- and Lyapunov-based} feedback controller designs toward \\textit{model-free} ones. Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a key tool for designing model-free controllers. Various studies have been carried out to study voltage/frequency control strategies via RL. However, usually a simplified system model is used neglecting detailed dynamics of solar, wind, and composite loads -- and damping system-wide oscillations and modeling power flows are all usually ignored. To that end, we pose an optimal feedback control problem for a detailed renewables-heavy power system, defined by a set of nonlinear differential algebraic equations (NDAE). The control problem is solved using a completely model-free design via RL as well as using a model-based approach built upon the Lyapunov stability theory with guarantees. The paper in its essence seeks to explore whether data-driven feedback control should be used in power grids over its model-driven counterpart. Theoretical developments and thorough case studies are presented with an eye on this exploration. Finally, a detailed analysis is provided to delineate the strengths and weaknesses of both approaches for renewables-heavy grids."}

Furthermore, leveraging foundation models to reduce the sim2real gap via intermediate representations fails to mitigate the domain shift fully and adds computational overhead during deployment. This work confronts dual challenges of data inefficiency and deployment complexity. We propose DiffuDepGrasp, a deploy-efficient sim2real framework enabling zero-shot transfer through simulation-exclusive policy training. Its core innovation, the Diffusion Depth Generator, synthesizes geometrically pristine simulation depth with learned sensor-realistic noise via two synergistic modules. The first Diffusion Depth Module leverages temporal geometric priors to enable sample-efficient training of a conditional diffusion model that captures complex sensor noise distributions, while the second Noise Grafting Module preserves metric accuracy during perceptual artifact injection.

While vision-language models (VLMs) have shown considerable promise in multimodal reasoning, their application to complex human-computer interaction scenarios--such as strategy gaming--remains largely unexplored. Here, we introduce Yanyun-3, a general-purpose agent framework that, for the first time, enables autonomous cross-platform operation across three heterogeneous strategy game environments. By integrating the vision-language reasoning of Qwen2.5-VL with the precise execution capabilities of UI-TARS, Yanyun-3 successfully performs core tasks including target localization, combat resource allocation, and area control. Through systematic ablation studies, we evaluate the effects of various multimodal data combinations--static images, multi-image sequences, and videos--and propose the concept of combination granularity to differentiate between intra-sample fusion and inter-sample mixing strategies. We find that a hybrid strategy, which fuses multi-image and video data while mixing in static images (MV+S), substantially outperforms full fusion: it reduces inference time by 63% and boosts the BLEU-4 score by a factor of 12 (from 4.81% to 62.41%, approximately 12.98x). Operating via a closed-loop pipeline of screen capture, model inference, and action execution, the agent demonstrates strong real-time performance and cross-platform generalization. Beyond providing an efficient solution for strategy game automation, our work establishes a general paradigm for enhancing VLM performance through structured multimodal data organization, offering new insights into the interplay between static perception and dynamic reasoning in embodied intelligence."}

This problem can be especially challenging when: 1) the reference image is captured from an arbitrary viewpoint, and 2) the robot must operate with sparse-view scene reconstructions. In this paper, we address the IIN problem, by introducing SplatSearch, a novel architecture that leverages sparse-view 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) reconstructions. SplatSearch renders multiple viewpoints around candidate objects using a sparse online 3DGS map, and uses a multi-view diffusion model to complete missing regions of the rendered images, enabling robust feature matching against the goal image. A novel frontier exploration policy is introduced which uses visual context from the synthesized viewpoints with semantic context from the goal image to evaluate frontier locations, allowing the robot to prioritize frontiers that are semantically and visually relevant to the goal image.

However, current agents struggle with repetitive errors and lack the ability to learn from past experiences across sessions, limiting their long-term robustness and sample efficiency. We introduce WebCoach, a model-agnostic self-evolving framework that equips web browsing agents with persistent cross-session memory, enabling improved long-term planning, reflection, and continual learning without retraining. WebCoach consists of three key components: (1) a WebCondenser, which standardizes raw navigation logs into concise summaries; (2) an External Memory Store, which organizes complete trajectories as episodic experiences; and (3) a Coach, which retrieves relevant experiences based on similarity and recency, and decides whether to inject task-specific advice into the agent via runtime hooks. This design empowers web agents to access long-term memory beyond their native context window, improving robustness in complex browsing tasks. Moreover, WebCoach achieves self-evolution by continuously curating episodic memory from new navigation trajectories, enabling agents to improve over time without retraining. Evaluations on the WebVoyager benchmark demonstrate that WebCoach consistently improves the performance of browser-use agents across three different LLM backbones. With a 38B model, it increases task success rates from 47% to 61% while reducing or maintaining the average number of steps. Notably, smaller base models with WebCoach achieve performance comparable to the same web agent using GPT-4o."}

In our model, ground base stations (BSs) cooperatively serve multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and employ a time-division strategy in which beam scanning for sensing comes before data communication in each time slot. To maximize the sum communication rate while satisfying the total sensing mutual information (MI) requirement, we jointly optimize the UAV trajectories, communication and sensing power allocation, and the dynamic time-division ratio. The resulting non-convex optimization problem is efficiently solved using an alternating optimization (AO) framework. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed joint design significantly outperforms benchmark schemes with static or partially optimized resources. The findings also reveal the critical importance of dynamic trajectory and resource management for effectively navigating the sensing-communication trade-off, especially under stringent power or sensing constraints."}

However, in fields that rely on professional knowledge, such as medicine and law, such large-scale preference labels are often unachievable. In this paper, we propose a generative entropy-guided preference modeling approach named GEM for LLMs aligment at low-resource and domain-specific scenarios. Instead of training a discriminative reward model on preference data, we directly train the LLM to internalize a closed-loop optimization architecture that can extract and exploit the multi-dimensional, fine-grained cognitive signals implicit in human preferences. Specifically, our Cognitive Filtering module, based on entropy theory in decision making, first leverages Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to generate diverse candidate reasoning chains (CoTs) from preference data. Subsequently, it introduces a token scoring mechanism to rank and weight the sampled CoTs, boosting the importance of high-confidence answers and strategically high-entropy tokens. Building on these filtered preferences, we fine-tune the LLM using a novel self-evaluated group advantage algorithm, SEGA, which effectively aggregates group-level cognitive signals and transforms the entropy-based scores into implicit rewards for policy optimization. In these ways, GEM empowers the LLM to rely on its own judgments and establishes an entropy-guided closed-loop cognitive optimization framework, enabling highly efficient few-shot alignment of LLMs. Experiments on general benchmarks and domain-specific tasks (such as mathematical reasoning and medical dialogues) demonstrate that our GEM achieves significant improvements with few-shot preference data."}

Understanding such nuances is a requirement for successful natural communication, and often requires building a local world model which encodes such elements and captures the dynamics of their evolving states. However, it is not well-understood whether language models (LMs) construct or maintain a robust implicit representation of conversations. In this work, we evaluate the ability of LMs to encode and update their internal world model in dyadic conversations and test their malleability under linguistic alterations. To facilitate this, we apply seven minimal linguistic alterations to conversations sourced from popular datasets and construct two benchmarks comprising yes-no questions. We evaluate a wide range of open and closed source LMs and observe that they struggle to maintain robust accuracy. Our analysis unveils that LMs struggle to memorize crucial details, such as tracking entities under linguistic alterations to conversations. We then propose a dual-perspective interpretability framework which identifies transformer layers that are useful or harmful and highlights linguistic alterations most influenced by harmful layers, typically due to encoding spurious signals or relying on shortcuts. Inspired by these insights, we propose two layer-regularization based fine-tuning strategies that suppress the effect of the harmful layers."}

However, the reasoning underlying these solutions is often flawed. Advancing to rigorous proof-based mathematics requires reliable proof verification capabilities. We begin by analyzing multiple evaluation setups and show that focusing on a single benchmark can lead to brittle or misleading conclusions. To address this, we evaluate both proof-based and final-answer reasoning to obtain a more reliable measure of model performance. We then scale two major generative verification methods (GenSelect and LLM-as-a-Judge) to millions of tokens and identify their combination as the most effective framework for solution verification and selection. We further show that the choice of prompt for LLM-as-a-Judge significantly affects the model's performance, but reinforcement learning can reduce this sensitivity. However, despite improving proof-level metrics, reinforcement learning does not enhance final-answer precision, indicating that current models often reward stylistic or procedural correctness rather than mathematical validity. Our results establish practical guidelines for designing and evaluating scalable proof-verification and selection systems."}

The objective is to ensure that the time-averaged reward vector converges asymptotically to a predefined target set. Since standard RL algorithms operate on scalar rewards, we introduce a dynamic scalarization mechanism guided by Blackwell's Approachability Theorem. This theorem enables adaptive updates of the scalarization vector to guarantee convergence toward the target set. Assuming ergodicity, the Markov chain induced by the learned policies admits a stationary distribution, ensuring all states recur with finite return times. Our algorithm exploits this property by defining an inner loop that applies a policy gradient method (with baseline) between successive visits to a designated recurrent state, enforcing Blackwell's condition at each iteration. An outer loop then updates the scalarization vector after each recurrence. We establish theoretical convergence of the long-run average reward vector to the target set and validate the approach through a numerical example."}

This article puts forward a general and systematic post-processing algorithm for A* and other graph-search-based planners. The A* post-processing algorithm, called APP, is developed based on the costmap, which is widely used in commercial service robots. First, a bidirectional vertices reduction algorithm is proposed to tackle the asymm- etry of the path and the environments.

This article proposes a general and systematic approach to improve global path planning performance in semi-structured environments. A unidirectional road network is built to represent the traffic constraints in semi-structured environments and a hybrid strategy is proposed to achieve a guaranteed planning result.Cutting across the road at the starting and the goal points are allowed to achieve a shorter path.

While many adaptive observer designs exist for continuous-time systems, their discrete-time counterparts remain relatively unexplored. This paper proposes an initial excitation (IE)-based adaptive observer for discrete-time linear time-invariant systems. In contrast to conventional designs that rely on the persistence of excitation condition, which requires continuous excitation and infinite control effort, the proposed method does not require excitation for infinite time, thus making it more practical for stabilization tasks. We employ a two-layer filtering structure and a normalized gradient descent-based update law for learning the unknown parameters. We also propose modifying the regressors to enhance information extraction, leading to faster convergence. Rigorous theoretical analysis guarantees bounded and exponentially converging estimates of both states and parameters under the IE condition, and simulation results validate the efficacy of the proposed design."}

At the micro level, a carbon emission model for RIES components is established, and sensitivity analysis is conducted on 28 carbon-related parameters to identify highly sensitive determinants of emission reduction. Case studies based on typical operation data from a rural region in northern China demonstrate that coordinated electric-thermal DR and carbon trading can achieve maximum carbon-reduction potential. Furthermore, the identified high-sensitivity parameters provide essential theoretical guidance for enhancing the decarbonization potential of RIES."}

The MU integrates pneumatic actuation, a compliant lattice envelope, and candidate sites for optical waveguide sensing into a single printed body. In order to study reproducibility and scalability, a parametric design framework establishes deterministic rules linking actuator chamber dimensions to lattice unit cell size. Experimental homogenization of lattice specimens provides effective material properties for finite element simulation. Within this simulation environment, sensor placement is treated as a discrete optimization problem, where a finite set of candidate waveguide paths derived from lattice nodes is evaluated by introducing local stiffening, and the configuration minimizing deviation from baseline mechanical response is selected. Optimized models are fabricated and experimentally characterized, validating the preservation of mechanical performance while enabling embedded sensing. The workflow is further extended to scaled units and a two-finger gripper, demonstrating generality of the MU concept.

At the same time, existing diagnostic methods either depend on expensive multi-point instrumentation or stringent modeling assumptions that are untenable under single-point measurement constraints. This paper proposes a Fractional-Order Memory-Enhanced Attack-Diagnosis Scheme (FO-MADS) that achieves timely fault localization and cyber-resilient fault diagnosis using only one VPQ (voltage, active power, reactive power) measurement point. FO-MADS first constructs a dual fractional-order feature library by jointly applying Caputo and Grünwald-Letnikov derivatives, thereby amplifying micro-perturbations and slow drifts in the VPQ signal. A two-stage hierarchical classifier then pinpoints the affected inverter and isolates the faulty IGBT switch, effectively alleviating class imbalance. Robustness is further strengthened through Progressive Memory-Replay Adversarial Training (PMR-AT), whose attack-aware loss is dynamically re-weighted via Online Hard Example Mining (OHEM) to prioritize the most challenging samples. Experiments on a four-inverter IBR-dominated microgrid testbed comprising 1 normal and 24 fault classes under four attack scenarios demonstrate diagnostic accuracies of 96.6% (bias), 94.0% (noise), 92.8% (data replacement), and 95.7% (replay), while sustaining 96.7% under attack-free conditions.

We challenge the notion that more communication is always beneficial, hypothesizing instead that the core issue is the absence of resource rationality. We argue that \"free\" communication, by ignoring the principle of scarcity, inherently breeds inefficiency and unnecessary expenses. To address this, we introduce the Dynamic Auction-based Language Agent (DALA), a novel framework that treats communication bandwidth as a scarce and tradable resource. Specifically, our DALA regards inter-agent communication as a centralized auction, where agents learn to bid for the opportunity to speak based on the predicted value density of their messages. Thus, our DALA intrinsically encourages agents to produce concise, informative messages while filtering out low-value communication. Extensive and comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our economically-driven DALA achieves new state-of-the-art performance across seven challenging reasoning benchmarks, including 84.32% on MMLU and a 91.21% pass@1 rate on HumanEval. Note that this is accomplished with remarkable efficiency, i.e., our DALA uses only 6.25 million tokens, a fraction of the resources consumed by current state-of-the-art methods on GSM8K. Further analysis reveals that our DALA cultivates the emergent skill of strategic silence, effectively adapting its communication strategies from verbosity to silence in a dynamical manner via resource constraints."}

This paper develops an event-triggered control (ETC) framework for mitigating congestion in such systems, which are modeled using an extended Aw-Rascle-Zhang (ARZ) formulation consisting of coupled 4 x 4 hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs). Ramp metering is employed as the boundary actuation mechanism. To reduce computational and communication burdens while avoiding excessive ramp signal changes, we design the ETC strategy based on the backstepping method, together with an observer-based ETC formulation for practical implementation under limited sensing. Rigorous Lyapunov analysis ensures exponential convergence and avoidance of Zeno behavior. Extensive simulations validate the proposed approach under diverse traffic scenarios, including varying AV penetration rates, different spacing policies, multiple demand levels, and non-recurrent congestion patterns. Results show that ETC not only stabilizes mixed traffic flows but also significantly reduces control updates, improving driver comfort, and roadway safety. Higher AV penetration rates lead to longer release time and fewer triggering events, indicating the positive impact of AVs in mitigating traffic congestion while reducing computational resource usage. Compared to continuous backstepping controllers, the proposed ETC achieves near-equivalent stabilization performance with far fewer controller updates, resulting in longer signal release time that reduces driver distraction, which demonstrates great potential for ETC applications in traffic management."}

We use a large Visual-Language Model (VLM), named PIGEON-VL, to select Points of Interest (PoI) formed during exploration and then employ a lower-level planner for action output, increasing the decision frequency. Additionally, this PoI-based decision-making enables the generation of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) data suitable for simulators.

In such scenarios, accurate odometry estimation is a preliminary requirement for stable locomotion, localization, and mapping. Traditional proprioceptive approaches, which rely on leg kinematics sensor modalities and inertial sensing, suffer from irrepressible vertical drift caused by frequent contact impacts, foot slippage, and vibrations, particularly affected by inaccurate roll and pitch estimation. Existing methods incorporate exteroceptive sensors such as LiDAR or cameras. Further enhancement has been introduced by leveraging gravity vector estimation to add additional observations on roll and pitch, thereby increasing the accuracy of vertical pose estimation. However, these approaches tend to degrade in feature-sparse or repetitive scenes and are prone to errors from double-integrated IMU acceleration. To address these challenges, we propose GaRLILEO, a novel gravity-aligned continuous-time radar-leg-inertial odometry framework. GaRLILEO decouples velocity from the IMU by building a continuous-time ego-velocity spline from SoC radar Doppler and leg kinematics information, enabling seamless sensor fusion which mitigates odometry distortion. In addition, GaRLILEO can reliably capture accurate gravity vectors leveraging a novel soft S2-constrained gravity factor, improving vertical pose accuracy without relying on LiDAR or cameras. Evaluated on a self-collected real-world dataset with diverse indoor-outdoor trajectories, GaRLILEO demonstrates state-of-the-art accuracy, particularly in vertical odometry estimation on stairs and slopes.

In this paper we propose a verbalization strategy to communicate robot plans informatively, by measuring the information gain that verbalizations have against a second-order theory of mind of the user capturing his prior knowledge on the robot. As shown in our experiments, this strategy allows to understand the robot's goal much quicker than by using strategies such as increasing or decreasing plan order.

However, the lack of training in specialized areas hinders their accuracy. Current training methods train a unified large language model (LLM) for all agents in the system. This may limit the performances due to different distributions underlying for different agents. Therefore, training multi-agent systems with distinct LLMs should be the next step to solve. However, this approach introduces optimization challenges. For example, agents operate at different frequencies, rollouts involve varying sub-agent invocations, and agents are often deployed across separate servers, disrupting end-to-end gradient flow. To address these issues, we propose M-GRPO, a hierarchical extension of Group Relative Policy Optimization designed for vertical Multi-agent systems with a main agent (planner) and multiple sub-agents (multi-turn tool executors). M-GRPO computes group-relative advantages for both main and sub-agents, maintaining hierarchical credit assignment. It also introduces a trajectory-alignment scheme that generates fixed-size batches despite variable sub-agent invocations. We deploy a decoupled training pipeline in which agents run on separate servers and exchange minimal statistics via a shared store. This enables scalable training without cross-server backpropagation. In experiments on real-world benchmarks (e.g., GAIA, XBench-DeepSearch, and WebWalkerQA), M-GRPO consistently outperforms both single-agent GRPO and multi-agent GRPO with frozen sub-agents, demonstrating improved stability and sample efficiency. These results show that aligning heterogeneous trajectories and decoupling optimization across specialized agents enhances tool-augmented reasoning tasks."}

This allows TSA to be recast as a pole-placement detection problem for the indicator function. By leveraging high-order derivatives at the initial state, a rational function approximation is derived, yielding a mathematically direct and computationally efficient prediction. Numerical validations on benchmark systems demonstrate that the method not only provides a direct mathematical shortcut for TSA in power systems but also establishes a promising new methodology for evaluating the transient stability of a broad class of nonlinear dynamical systems."}

Recent studies have confirmed the overly confident tendencies of machine-generated responses, particularly in large language models (LLMs). As these systems are increasingly embedded in ethical decision-making scenarios, it is important to understand their moral reasoning and the inherent uncertainties in building reliable AI systems. This work examines how uncertainty influences moral decisions in the classical trolley problem, analyzing responses from 32 open-source models and 9 distinct moral dimensions. We first find that variance in model confidence is greater across models than within moral dimensions, suggesting that moral uncertainty is predominantly shaped by model architecture and training method. To quantify uncertainty, we measure binary entropy as a linear combination of total entropy, conditional entropy, and mutual information. To examine its effects, we introduce stochasticity into models via \"dropout\" at inference time. Our findings show that our mechanism increases total entropy, mainly through a rise in mutual information, while conditional entropy remains largely unchanged. Moreover, this mechanism significantly improves human-LLM moral alignment, with correlations in mutual information and alignment score shifts. Our results highlight the potential to better align model-generated decisions and human preferences by deliberately modulating uncertainty and reducing LLMs' confidence in morally complex scenarios."}

Bolstered by growing reasoning capabilities, large language models (LLMs) offer a promising path to enhance healthcare predictions by drawing on their rich parametric knowledge. However, LLMs are prone to factual inaccuracies due to limitations in the reliability and coverage of their embedded knowledge. While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) frameworks, such as GraphRAG and its variants, have been proposed to mitigate these issues by incorporating external knowledge, they face two key challenges in the healthcare scenario: (1) identifying the clinical necessity to activate the retrieval mechanism, and (2) achieving synergy between the retriever and the generator to craft contextually appropriate retrievals. To address these challenges, we propose GHAR, a \\underline{g}enerative \\underline{h}ierarchical \\underline{a}gentic \\underline{R}AG framework that simultaneously resolves when to retrieve and how to optimize the collaboration between submodules in healthcare. Specifically, for the first challenge, we design a dual-agent architecture comprising Agent-Top and Agent-Low. Agent-Top acts as the primary physician, iteratively deciding whether to rely on parametric knowledge or to initiate retrieval, while Agent-Low acts as the consulting service, summarising all task-relevant knowledge once retrieval was triggered. To tackle the second challenge, we innovatively unify the optimization of both agents within a formal Markov Decision Process, designing diverse rewards to align their shared goal of accurate prediction while preserving their distinct roles. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets across three popular tasks demonstrate our superiority over state-of-the-art baselines, highlighting the potential of hierarchical agentic RAG in advancing healthcare systems."}

This paper presents the Cultural Norm-based Cultural Alignment (CNCA) framework, which enables models to leverage their powerful reasoning ability to align with cultural norms. Specifically, we propose three methods to automatically mine cultural norms from limited survey data and explore ways to effectively utilize these norms for improving cultural alignment. Two alignment paradigms are examined: an in-context alignment method, where cultural norms are explicitly integrated into the user context, and a fine-tuning-based method, which internalizes norms through enhanced Chain-of-Thought training data. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods, highlighting that models with stronger reasoning capabilities benefit more from cultural norm mining and utilization. Our findings emphasize the potential for reasoning models to better reflect diverse human values through culturally informed alignment strategies."}

We establish comprehensive convergence guarantees for this approach.

We investigate this by training GPT-2 models on three spatial learning paradigms in grid environments: passive exploration (Foraging Model- predicting steps in random walks), goal-directed planning (generating optimal shortest paths) on structured Hamiltonian paths (SP-Hamiltonian), and a hybrid model fine-tuned with exploratory data (SP-Random Walk). Using behavioural, representational and mechanistic analyses, we uncover two fundamentally different learned algorithms. The Foraging model develops a robust, map-like representation of space, akin to a 'cognitive map'. Causal interventions reveal that it learns to consolidate spatial information into a self-sufficient coordinate system, evidenced by a sharp phase transition where its reliance on historical direction tokens vanishes by the middle layers of the network. The model also adopts an adaptive, hierarchical reasoning system, switching between a low-level heuristic for short contexts and map-based inference for longer ones. In contrast, the goal-directed models learn a path-dependent algorithm, remaining reliant on explicit directional inputs throughout all layers. The hybrid model, despite demonstrating improved generalisation over its parent, retains the same path-dependent strategy. These findings suggest that the nature of spatial intelligence in transformers may lie on a spectrum, ranging from generalisable world models shaped by exploratory data to heuristics optimised for goal-directed tasks. We provide a mechanistic account of this generalisation-optimisation trade-off and highlight how the choice of training regime influences the strategies that emerge."}

Rigorously validated against field-test data from calibrated equipment, the model demonstrates high accuracy in predicting minute-wised dynamic electrical characteristics (R2 > 0.90). A key finding is the critical shortcoming of conventional, coarser-resolution models under realistic shading; these are shown to overestimate the actual string operating power by up to 163% and the monthly energy yield by up to 54%. The proposed framework avoids these errors by precisely capturing mismatch losses and the time-varying phenomena of system components, such as bypass diode activations. Furthermore, the model accurately quantifies the effectiveness of mitigation technologies, showing that Module-Level Power Electronics (MLPEs) can increase the monthly energy yield of a heavily shaded string by over 20%. This research provides a crucial tool for reliable system design, accurate power forecasting, and the optimization of PV systems in complex urban settings."}

Long-range flights often trigger frequent inter-cell handovers, which may introduce delays and synchronization overhead. We jointly optimize the continuous trajectory and BS association to minimize handovers, path length, and flying time, subject to communication reliability and kinematic constraints. To address this problem, we reformulate it as an optimization based on the graph of convex sets (GCS). First, the URLLC requirement is translated into spatially feasible regions in the flight plane for each BS. And an intersection graph is constructed including the start and goal points. Each graph node is associated with a smooth and dynamically feasible trajectory segment. The trajectory is parameterized in space by Bézier curves and in time by a monotonic Bézier scaling, together with convex constraints that ensure continuity and enforce speed bounds. Next, we impose unit-flow constraints to enforce a single path, and by coupling the resulting binary edge-selection variables with the convex constraints, we obtain a mixed-integer convex program (MICP). Applying a convex relaxation and rounding to the mixed-integer convex program produces nearly globally optimal routes, and a final refinement yields smooth, dynamically feasible trajectories. Simulations verify that the method preserves URLLC connectivity while achieving a clear trade-off between fewer handovers and flight efficiency."}

Moreover, traditional step-wise and episodic RL methods often neglect the contact-rich information inherent in task-space manipulation, especially considering the contact-safety and robustness. In this work, contact-rich manipulation tasks are tackled using a task-space, energy-safe framework, where reliable and safe task-space trajectories are generated through the combination of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and movement primitives. Furthermore, an energy-aware Cartesian Impedance Controller objective is incorporated within the proposed framework to ensure safe interactions between the robot and the environment.

In Europe, multi-year storage reduces system costs by 4.1%, fossil imports by 86%, and curtailment by 60%. The benefit of multi-year storage is that a renewable surplus in one year is not curtailed but converted to synthetic oil, with hydrogen as an intermediate product, and stored to balance a future deficit. We find that the required energy capacity for liquid hydrocarbons is 525 TWh, a quarter of the European Union's current oil and gas reserves, complemented by 116 TWh for hydrogen storage. Security of supply remains high and unserved energy only amounts to 0.0035 per thousand, well below the common target of 0.02 per thousand."}

However, such datasets remain scarce, limiting progress in both research and applications. To address this, this paper presents a protocol for multimodal dataset collection designed to reflect social anxiety in a human-robot interaction context. The dataset will consist of synchronised audio, video, and physiological recordings acquired from at least 70 participants, grouped according to their level of social anxiety, as they engage in approximately 10-minute interactive Wizard-of-Oz role-play scenarios with the Furhat social robot under controlled experimental conditions. In addition to multimodal data, the dataset will be enriched with contextual data providing deeper insight into individual variability in social anxiety responses.

The controversial directive obliged telecom and Internet access providers in Europe to retain metadata of all their customers for intelligence and law enforcement purposes, for a period of up to two years. In the ruling, the Court declared the directive in violation of the human rights to privacy and data protection. The Court also confirmed that the mere collection of metadata interferes with the human right to privacy. In addition, the Court developed three new criteria for assessing the level of data security required from a human rights perspective: security measures should take into account the risk of unlawful access to data, and the data's quantity and sensitivity. While organizations that campaigned against the directive have welcomed the ruling, we warn for the risk of proceduralization of mass surveillance law. The Court did not fully condemn mass surveillance that relies on metadata, but left open the possibility of mass surveillance if policymakers lay down sufficient procedural safeguards. Such proceduralization brings systematic risks for human rights.

Traditional devices often encounter limitations due to their dependence on empirical material design and basic signal processing techniques. To overcome these issues, we introduce the concept of Human-Symbiotic Health Intelligence (HSHI), which is a framework that integrates multi-modal sensor networks with edge-cloud collaborative computing and a hybrid approach to data and knowledge modeling. HSHI is designed to adapt dynamically to both inter-individual and intra-individual variability, transitioning health management from passive monitoring to an active collaborative evolution. The framework incorporates AI-driven optimization of materials and micro-structures, provides robust interpretation of multi-modal signals, and utilizes a dual mechanism that merges population-level insights with personalized adaptations. Moreover, the integration of closed-loop optimization through reinforcement learning and digital twins facilitates customized interventions and feedback. In general, HSHI represents a significant shift in healthcare, moving towards a model that emphasizes prevention, adaptability, and a harmonious relationship between technology and health management."}

We present a data-driven framework to accelerate MPC by replacing online optimization with a nonparametric policy constructed from offline MPC solutions. Our policy is greedy with respect to a constructed upper bound on the optimal cost-to-go, and can be implemented as a nonparametric lookup rule that is orders of magnitude faster than solving MPC online. Our analysis shows that under sufficient coverage condition of the offline data, the policy is recursively feasible and admits provable, bounded optimality gap. These conditions establish an explicit trade-off between the amount of data collected and the tightness of the bounds. Our experiments show that this policy is between 100 and 1000 times faster than standard MPC, with only a modest hit to optimality, showing potential for real-time control tasks."}

In this setting, perfect tracking or rejection is achieved by constructing a zero-regulation-error manifold π(w) and a feedforward input c(w) that render such manifold invariant. The pair (π(w), c(w)) is characterized by the regulator equations, i.e., a system of PDEs with an algebraic constraint. We focus on accurately solving the regulator equations introducing a physics-informed neural network (PINN) approach that directly approximates π(w) and c(w) by minimizing the residuals under boundary and feasibility conditions, without requiring precomputed trajectories or labeled data. The learned operator maps exosystem states to steady state plant states and inputs, enables real-time inference and, critically, generalizes across families of the exosystem with varying initial conditions and parameters. The framework is validated on a regulation task that synchronizes a helicopter's vertical dynamics with a harmonically oscillating platform. The resulting PINN-based solver reconstructs the zero-error manifold with high fidelity and sustains regulation performance under exosystem variations, highlighting the potential of learning-enabled solvers for nonlinear output regulation. The proposed approach is broadly applicable to nonlinear systems that admit a solution to the output regulation problem."}

The absence of an existing benchmark further exacerbates this dilemma. To this end, we propose CreBench, which consists of two key components: 1) an evaluation benchmark covering the multiple dimensions from creative idea to process to products; 2) CreMIT (Creativity Multimodal Instruction Tuning dataset), a multimodal creativity evaluation dataset, consisting of 2.2K diverse-sourced multimodal data, 79.2K human feedbacks and 4.7M multi-typed instructions. Specifically, to ensure MLLMs can handle diverse creativity-related queries, we prompt GPT to refine these human feedbacks to activate stronger creativity assessment capabilities. CreBench serves as a foundation for building MLLMs that understand human-aligned creativity. Based on the CreBench, we fine-tune open-source general MLLMs, resulting in CreExpert, a multimodal creativity evaluation expert model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed CreExpert models achieve significantly better alignment with human creativity evaluation compared to state-of-the-art MLLMs, including the most advanced GPT-4V and Gemini-Pro-Vision."}

However, only 5 combinations (10.4%) demonstrate meaningful preference coherence through adaptive or threshold-based behavior, while 26 (54.2%) show no detectable trade-off behavior. The observed patterns can be explained by three distinct decision-making architectures: comprehensive trade-off systems, selective trigger mechanisms, and no stable decision-making paradigm. Testing an instrumental hypothesis through temporal horizon manipulation reveals paradoxical patterns inconsistent with pure strategic optimization. The prevalence of unstable transitions (45.8%) and stimulus-specific sensitivities suggests current AI systems lack unified preference structures, raising concerns about deployment in contexts requiring complex value trade-offs."}

Motivated by sub-transmission operations at RTE, this paper considers the Optimal Transmission Switching with De-energization (OTSD), which captures potential loss of connectivity (and therefore localized blackout) following loss of transmission elements. While directly relevant to real-life operations, this problem has received very little attention in the literature. The paper proposes a new mixed-integer linear programming formulation for OTSD that represents post-contingency loss of connectivity without requiring additional binary variables. This new formulation provides the foundation for a fast, iterative heuristic algorithm. Computational experiments confirms that state-of-the-art optimization solvers struggle to solve the extensive formulation of OTSD, often failing to find even trivial solutions within reasonable time. In contrast, numerical results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed heuristic, which finds high-quality feasible solutions 100-1000x faster than using Gurobi."}

This study introduces a grid-level defense strategy aimed at enhancing attack resiliency based on distribution network planning. Our proposed framework imposes a security requirement into existing planning methodologies, ensuring that voltage deviation from its rated value remains within a tolerable range against dynamically and maliciously injected power at end-user nodes. Unfortunately, the formulated problem in its original form is intractable because it is an infinite-dimensional bi-level optimization problem over a function space. To address this complexity, we develop an equivalent transformation into a tractable form as mixed-integer linear program leveraging linear dynamical system theory and graph theory. Notably, our investigation reveals that the severity of potential attacks hinges solely on the cumulative reactances over the path from the substation to the targeted node, thereby reducing the problem to a finite-dimensional problem. Further, the bi-level optimization problem is reduced to a single-level optimization problem by using a technique utilized in solving the shortest path problem. Through extensive numerical simulations conducted on a 54-node distribution network benchmark, our proposed methodology exhibits a noteworthy 29.3% enhancement in the resiliency, with a mere 2.1% uptick in the economic cost."}

To address this gap, we collect data from 21 occupational therapists performing 15 ADL tasks on two manikins.

We further analyze expert caregiving principles and strategies, offering insights to improve robot efficiency and task feasibility.

Precision grasping enables tool use and is believed to have influenced human evolution. Today's multi-fingered robotic hands are effective in power grasps, but for tasks requiring precision, parallel grippers are still more widely adopted. This contrast highlights a key limitation in current robotic hand design: the difficulty of achieving both stable power grasps and precise, fine-grained manipulation within a single, versatile system. In this work, we bridge this gap by jointly optimizing the control and hardware design of a multi-fingered dexterous hand, enabling both power and precision manipulation. Rather than redesigning the entire hand, we introduce a lightweight fingertip geometry modification, represent it as a contact plane, and jointly optimize its parameters along with the corresponding control. Our control strategy dynamically switches between power and precision manipulation and simplifies precision control into parallel thumb-index motions, which proves robust for sim-to-real transfer. On the design side, we leverage large-scale simulation to optimize the fingertip geometry using a differentiable neural-physics surrogate model. We validate our approach through extensive experiments in both sim-to-real and real-to-real settings. Our method achieves an 82.5% zero-shot success rate on unseen objects in sim-to-real precision grasping, and a 93.3% success rate in challenging real-world tasks involving bread pinching. These results demonstrate that our co-design framework can significantly enhance the fine-grained manipulation ability of multi-fingered hands without reducing their ability for power grasps.

This study investigates whether advanced LLMs behave as rational agents or whether they reproduce human behavioural tendencies when faced with classic decision problems. Using two canonical experiments in behavioural economics, the ultimatum game and a gambling game, we elicit decisions from two state of the art models, Google Gemma7B and Qwen, under neutral and gender conditioned prompts. We estimate parameters of inequity aversion and loss-aversion and compare them with human benchmarks. The models display attenuated but persistent deviations from rationality, including moderate fairness concerns, mild loss aversion, and subtle gender conditioned differences."}

This is the extended version, including the technical appendix", "summary": "Precise estimation and uncertainty quantification for average crop yields are critical for agricultural monitoring and decision making. Existing data collection methods, such as crop cuts in randomly sampled fields at harvest time, are relatively time-consuming. Thus, we propose an approach based on prediction-powered inference (PPI) to supplement these crop cuts with less time-consuming field photos. After training a computer vision model to predict the ground truth crop cut yields from the photos, we learn a ``control function\" that recalibrates these predictions with the spatial coordinates of each field. This enables fields with photos but not crop cuts to be leveraged to improve the precision of zone-wide average yield estimates. Our control function is learned by training on a dataset of nearly 20,000 real crop cuts and photos of rice and maize fields in sub-Saharan Africa. To improve precision, we pool training observations across different zones within the same first-level subdivision of each country. Our final PPI-based point estimates of the average yield are provably asymptotically unbiased and cannot increase the asymptotic variance beyond that of the natural baseline estimator -- the sample average of the crop cuts -- as the number of fields grows. We also propose a novel bias-corrected and accelerated (BCa) bootstrap to construct accompanying confidence intervals. Even in zones with as few as 20 fields, the point estimates show significant empirical improvement over the baseline, increasing the effective sample size by as much as 73% for rice and by 12-23% for maize. The confidence intervals are accordingly shorter at minimal cost to empirical finite-sample coverage. This demonstrates the potential for relatively low-cost images to make area-based crop insurance more affordable and thus spur investment into sustainable agricultural practices."}
