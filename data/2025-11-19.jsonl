Existing approaches often focus either on technical aspects, such as datasets and models, or on high-level socio-ethical considerations - rarely capturing how these elements interact in practice. In this paper, we apply an information flow-based modeling framework to a real-world recruitment process that integrates automated candidate matching with human decision-making. Through semi-structured stakeholder interviews and iterative modeling, we construct a multi-level representation of the recruitment pipeline, capturing how information is transformed, filtered, and interpreted across both algorithmic and human components. We identify where biases may emerge, how they can propagate through the system, and what downstream impacts they may have on candidates. This case study illustrates how information flow modeling can support structured analysis of fairness risks, providing transparency across complex socio-technical systems."}

We leverage a unique natural experiment on Change.org, a leading social advocacy platform, to causally investigate the effects of an in-platform ''write with AI'' tool. To understand the impact of the AI integration, we collected 1.5 million petitions and employed a difference-in-differences analysis. Our findings reveal that in-platform AI access significantly altered the lexical features of petitions and increased petition homogeneity, but did not improve petition outcomes. We confirmed the results in a separate analysis of repeat petition writers who wrote petitions before and after introduction of the AI tool. The results suggest that while AI writing tools can profoundly reshape online content, their practical utility for improving desired outcomes may be less beneficial than anticipated, and introduce unintended consequences like content homogenization."}

Researchers' Perspectives on AI in Manufacturing and Materials Science", "comment": null, "summary": "Artificial intelligence (AI) raises expectations of substantial increases in rates of technological and scientific progress, but such anticipations are often not connected to detailed ground-level studies of AI use in innovation processes. Accordingly, it remains unclear how and to what extent AI can accelerate innovation. To help to fill this gap, we report results from 32 interviews with U.S.-based academic manufacturing and materials sciences researchers experienced with AI and machine learning (ML) techniques. Interviewees primarily used AI for modeling of materials and manufacturing processes, facilitating cheaper and more rapid search of design spaces for materials and manufacturing processes alike. They report benefits including cost, time, and computation savings in technology development. However, interviewees also report that AI/ML tools are unreliable outside design spaces for which dense data are already available; that they require skilled and judicious application in tandem with older research techniques; and that AI/ML tools may detrimentally circumvent opportunities for disruptive theoretical advancement. Based on these results, we suggest there is reason for optimism about acceleration in sustaining innovations through the use of to AI/ML; but that support for conventional empirical, computational, and theoretical research is required to maintain the likelihood of further major advances in manufacturing and materials science."}

This problem is interesting because LLMs often hallucinate when direct evidence to answer a question is lacking, and these effects become more pronounced in a network of interacting LLMs. The hallucination spreads, causing previously accurate LLMs to hallucinate. We study interacting LLMs and their hallucination by combining novel ideas of mean-field dynamics (MFD) from network science and the randomized utility model from economics to construct a useful generative model. We model the LLM with a latent state that indicates if it is truthful or not with respect to the ground truth, and extend a tractable analytical model considering an MFD to model the diffusion of information in a directed network of LLMs. To specify the probabilities that govern the dynamics of the MFD, we propose a randomized utility model. For a network of LLMs, where each LLM has two possible latent states, we posit sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of a fixed point and analyze the behavior of the fixed point in terms of the incentive (e.g., test-time compute) given to individual LLMs. We experimentally study and analyze the behavior of a network of $100$ open-source LLMs with respect to data heterogeneity, node capability, network structure, and sensitivity to framing on multiple semi-synthetic datasets."}

By the 1950s, it obviously needed to close all its branches in Mao's People's Republic of China, yet could somehow hold its Shanghai branch, which continued likely in the shadows, as non-state banking was illegalised and even simple land owners were executed merely for being labelled \"capitalist\". This Asia-focused bank --in spite of it all-- grew from these conditions into the behemoth it is today. Part of the growth was based on the economic boom in its core market Hong Kong, to which HSBC likely also contributed. To expand and diversify, HSBC continued the growth strategy that already started since its early days in the 1860s, this time just also inorganically: It acquired other banks, in most cases fully and in other regions. The most important acquisition was the takeover of the roughly equally-sized UK-based Midland Bank; for the following reasons: 1) It came just a year after the 1991 change of HSBC's headquarters and place of incorporation to London, so HSBC could smoothly integrate with Midland. This step also came with an additional listing of securities in London, providing HSBC funds. 2) These funds were used efficiently without much idling for the humongous acquisition. 3) The preceding decade of Margaret Thatcher's banking and finance deregulation in the UK created a beneficial environment for HSBC. 4) HSBC was proven right by the developments in Hong Kong, where the Communist Party of China illegally eroded democracy, the rule of law and civil liberties since 2020, despite promising to maintain these at least until 1 July 2047. A list of likely reasons for HSBC's prosperity and stability in face of the at times hostile environments is also provided, from which business lessons can be drawn."}

For each hire, we collected data about their background and experiences, the previous success as a head coach or coordinator and their success since hiring. Over 50 variables on these factors were recorded though we used 29 of these in building our predictive model. Our measure of success is based upon Bill Connelly's SP+ team ratings relative to the performance on the same metric of the school in the 15 year prior to their selection as head coach. Using a cross-validated regularized linear regression, we obtain a predictive model for coaching success. Among the important factors for predicting a successful hire are having been a previous college head coach, having won a prior conference championship as a head coach, leaving a job as an Offensive Coordinator, age and quality of the hiring school's team in the previous 15 years. While we do find these factors are important for the prediction of a successful coaching hire, the trends here are weak. With 66% accuracy, the model does identify coaching hires that will outperform team performance in the 15 years before the hire. However, no combination of these factors leads to high predictability of identifying a successful coaching hire. All of the data and code for this paper are available in a Github repository."}

This paper presents a system-level framework for MAPF that integrates planning and execution, generalizes across variants, and explicitly models uncertainties. At its core is the MAPF system, a formal model that casts MAPF as a control design problem encompassing classical and uncertainty-aware formulations. To solve it, we introduce Finite-Horizon Closed-Loop Factorization (FICO), a factorization-based algorithm inspired by receding-horizon control that exploits compositional structure for efficient closed-loop operation. FICO enables real-time responses -- commencing execution within milliseconds -- while scaling to thousands of agents and adapting seamlessly to execution-time uncertainties. Extensive case studies demonstrate that it reduces computation time by up to two orders of magnitude compared with open-loop baselines, while delivering significantly higher throughput under stochastic delays and agent arrivals. These results establish a principled foundation for analyzing and advancing MAPF through system-level modeling, factorization, and closed-loop design."}

We give an ancilla-free, depth-optimal encoder that prepares a W_n state using n-1 two-qubit rotations per block, and a two-local XY mixer restricted to the same block of n qubits with a constant spectral gap. Algorithmically, we wrap constant-depth sampling with a deterministic classical checker to obtain a polynomial-time hybrid quantum-classical solver (PHQC) that returns the best observed feasible solution in O(S n^2) time, where S is the number of shots. We obtain two advantages. First, when CE-QAOA fixes r >= 1 locations different from the start city, we achieve a Theta(n^r) reduction in shot complexity even against a classical sampler that draws uniformly from the feasible set. Second, against a classical baseline restricted to raw bitstring sampling, we show an exp(Theta(n^2)) separation in the minimax sense. In noiseless circuit simulations of TSP instances ranging from 4 to 10 locations from the QOPTLib benchmark library, we recover the global optimum at depth p = 1 using polynomial shot budgets and coarse parameter grids defined by the problem sizes."}

However, spatial reasoning:a fundamental component of human cognition that includes mental rotation, navigation, and spatial relationship comprehension remains a significant challenge for current advanced VLMs. We hypothesize that imagination, the internal simulation of spatial states, is the dominant reasoning mechanism within a spatial world model. To test this hypothesis and systematically probe current VLM spatial reasoning mechanisms, we introduce SpatiaLite, a fully synthetic benchmark that jointly measures spatial reasoning accuracy and reasoning efficiency. Comprehensive experiments reveal three key findings. First, advanced VLMs predominantly rely on linguistic representations for reasoning and imagination, resulting in significant deficiencies on visual centric tasks that demand perceptual spatial relations and 3D geometry transformations such as mental rotation or projection prediction. Second, advanced VLMs exhibit severe inefficiency in their current spatial reasoning mechanisms, with token usage growing rapidly as transformation complexity increases. Third, we propose an Imagery Driven Framework (IDF) for data synthesis and training, which can implicitly construct an internal world model that is critical for spatial reasoning in VLMs. Building on SpatiaLite, this work delineates the spatial reasoning limits and patterns of advanced VLMs, identifies key shortcomings, and informs future advances"}

Using annual data for 48 countries from 1991-2017, we estimate function-on-function regressions linking poverty headcount ratios to market concentration and other macroeconomic indicators. The results show that, based on the entire sample, stronger competition initially increased poverty during structural adjustment phases, but its adverse impact weakened after 2010 as economies adapted and efficiency gains emerged. The estimated bivariate surfaces reveal that the effect of competition on poverty often persists over multiple years (around 5 years), highlighting the importance of intertemporal transmission. Then, functional clustering based on market capitalization (MCAP) uncovers strong heterogeneity: pro-poor 5-years lagged effect of competition in low- and medium-MCAP economies, while it remains insignificant to weakly negative in high-MCAP countries. Overall, the findings underscore the value of functional data methods in uncovering evolving and lag-dependent poverty-competition linkages that static panel models fail to capture."}

In this paper, I motivate the necessity of incorporating insights from Physics, and also show that trade as a phenomenon described by the comparative advantage theory cannot exist without the law of conservation of Energy, and incorporating this law leads to axiomatic completeness of the theory. Further, I also argue that while the economy is not a zero-sum game in terms of wealth, it does require at least one associated zero-sum parameter for trade and economy as phenomena to exist."}

These opposing interface models create workload-dependent tradeoffs that are not captured by small-scale studies. This work presents a side-by-side, large-scale comparison of PIM and CXL-PIM using measurements from real PIM hardware and trace-driven CXL modeling.

A key factor influencing MFC performance is the anode structure, where design and material properties play a crucial role. Existing predictive models struggle to capture the complex geometric dependencies necessary to optimize these structures. To solve this problem, we propose KANGURA: Kolmogorov-Arnold Network-Based Geometry-Aware Learning with Unified Representation Attention. KANGURA introduces a new approach to three-dimensional (3D) machine learning modeling. It formulates prediction as a function decomposition problem, where Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN)- based representation learning reconstructs geometric relationships without a conventional multi- layer perceptron (MLP). To refine spatial understanding, geometry-disentangled representation learning separates structural variations into interpretable components, while unified attention mechanisms dynamically enhance critical geometric regions. Experimental results demonstrate that KANGURA outperforms over 15 state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on the ModelNet40 benchmark dataset, achieving 92.7% accuracy, and excels in a real-world MFC anode structure problem with 97% accuracy. This establishes KANGURA as a robust framework for 3D geometric modeling, unlocking new possibilities for optimizing complex structures in advanced manufacturing and quality-driven engineering applications."}

These problems are well known for slow convergence rates and non-standard limiting behavior, even under point identified parametric frameworks. In nonparametric settings, they may further suffer from failures of identification. To address these challenges, we introduce a strictly convex surrogate loss that point-identifies a representative nonparametric policy function. We then estimate this surrogate policy to conduct inference on both the optimal classification policy and the optimal policy value. This approach enables Gaussian inference, substantially simplifying empirical implementation relative to working directly with the original classification problem. In particular, we establish root-$n$ asymptotic normality for the optimal policy value and derive a Gaussian approximation for the optimal classification policy at the standard nonparametric rate. Extensive simulation studies corroborate the theoretical findings. We apply our method to the National JTPA Study to conduct inference on the optimal treatment assignment policy and its associated welfare."}

Using data from 1,343 students across 15 cohorts (2004-2019) in a public engineering faculty in Argentina, we construct a leak-aware, multilevel feature set that incorporates national inflation indicators, lagged exposure to teacher strikes, and interaction terms between macro shocks and curriculum friction. Random Forest models with cohort-based validation demonstrate that macro features provide stable, non-trivial gains in early-semester dropout prediction (improvement in Macro F1 from 0.73 to 0.78), with inflation volatility at entry and a strike-weighted basic-cycle friction index amongst the most influential variables. Lag analysis reveals that strike exposure exerts its strongest association with dropout two to three semesters after the disruption (OR = 2.34), and that effects are concentrated in early, high-friction semesters. We then embed these empirical patterns into an agent-based model, defining scenarios for inflation-only, strikes-only, and combined crisis. Simulations reproduce three stylised facts: delayed strike effects, basic-cycle vulnerability, and non-linear amplification when inflation and strikes co-occur, with combined shocks generating dropout levels 18-23% higher than the sum of individual effects. We argue that teacher strikes and inflation operate as structurally mediated educational disruptors, acting through curriculum design and financial resilience rather than as isolated events. The framework contributes to multilevel dropout theory by demonstrating how macro-level shocks propagate through institutional structures to shape individual trajectories and provides empirically grounded tools for scenario planning in macroeconomically unstable contexts."}

I allow the space of all signals the data broker can sell to be arbitrarily correlated with the signal the decision maker owns. This plays a key role in designing the optimal menu. In the binary action setting, the data broker extracts the efficient surplus by offering a distinct binary signal for each type. Moreover, this result holds even when the broker does not know the prior distribution over states.

As a non-invasive and cost-effective technique, electroencephalography (EEG) is gaining increasing attention for its potential to identify reliable biomarkers for early detection and differential diagnosis of AD and FTD. Considering the behavioral similarities of signals from adjacent EEG channels, we propose a new spectral dependence measure, the nonlinear vector coherence (NVC), to capture beyond-linear interactions between oscillations of two multivariate time series observed from distinct brain regions. This addresses the limitations of conventional channel-to-channel approaches and defines a more natural region-to-region connectivity framework in the frequency domain. As a result, the NVC measure offers a new approach to investigate dependence between brain regions, which then enables to identify altered functional connectivity dynamics associated with AD and FTD. We further introduce a rank-based inference procedure that enables fast and distribution-free estimation of the proposed measure, as well as a fully nonparametric test for spectral independence. The empirical performance of our proposed inference methodology is demonstrated through extensive numerical experiments. An application to resting-state EEG data reveals that our novel NVC measure uncovers distinct and diagnostically meaningful connectivity patterns which effectively discriminate healthy individuals from those with AD and FTD."}

Hypothesis 2: baseline expression of OGT and CDO1 predicts the strength of repressed and induced radiation-response modules in breast cancer cells (GSE59732). Hypothesis 3: a 12-gene expression signature predicts biochemical recurrence-free survival after prostate radiotherapy plus androgen deprivation therapy (GSE116918).

OGT showed only a weak association (r = 0.23, p = 0.34), whereas CDO1 was a clear outlier (r = 0.70, empirical p = 0.0039).

This paper demonstrates how Large Language Models (LLMs) can dismantle these protective barriers by democratizing access to strategic expertise. Through empirical analysis of rent division scenarios on Spliddit algorithms, we show that users can obtain actionable manipulation strategies via simple conversational queries to AI assistants. We present four distinct manipulation scenarios: exclusionary collusion where majorities exploit minorities, defensive counterstrategies that backfire, benevolent subsidization of specific participants, and cost minimization coalitions. Our experiments reveal that LLMs can explain algorithmic mechanics, identify profitable deviations, and generate specific numerical inputs for coordinated preference misreporting--capabilities previously requiring deep technical knowledge. These findings extend algorithmic collective action theory from classification contexts to resource allocation scenarios, where coordinated preference manipulation replaces feature manipulation. The implications reach beyond rent division to any domain using algorithmic fairness mechanisms for resource division. While AI-enabled manipulation poses risks to system integrity, it also creates opportunities for preferential treatment of equity deserving groups. We argue that effective responses must combine algorithmic robustness, participatory design, and equitable access to AI capabilities, acknowledging that strategic sophistication is no longer a scarce resource."}

This contradiction arises from the central role of the observer in phenomena such as the collapse of the wave function and their influence on the construction of reality, which challenges the classical notion of an objective, non-perceptual nature. Moreover, the encounter between social realism and social interpretivism lies in the fact that, in the social sciences, it is also recognized that human interpretations and actions shape social reality, creating a scenario in which absolute objectivity becomes difficult to sustain. These tensions, therefore enrich the epistemological and ontological debate, showing that the contradictions of quantum realism transcend physics and connect deeply with the difficulties and dynamics of the social construction of reality."}

The five models are: the null model, which is based only on the live scores, a logistic regression model, a basic simulation model, a time-adjusted simulation model, and a new variation of the Massey model which updates based on the current score. We evaluate these models using two approaches. First, we compare their Brier scores. Second, we conduct head-to-head comparisons in a betting game in which one model sets the betting odds while the other places bets. In both cases, model performance is assessed not only at the start of the game but also at the start of each round. Across both evaluation methods, the score-dependent Massey model performs the best. We conclude by illustrating how this score-dependent Massey model framework can be adapted to other competitive settings beyond darts."}

This paper proposes a tri-level, two-stage stochastic-robust optimization (SRO) co-planning framework that jointly determines RCS siting and DN expansion while accounting for transportation flows and population density. The model distinguishes two uncertainty classes: (i) decision-dependent uncertainty (DDU), under which EV charging loads vary with RCS siting; and (ii) decision-independent uncertainty (DIU), under which load fluctuations and renewable-generation variability do not depend on the RCS locations or the DN topology. At the upper level, the framework selects RCS sites and DN expansions. At the middle level, EV routing and charging are dispatched given the RCS siting to produce charging loads DDU. At the lower level, DN operation minimizes annualized loss costs under the worst-case DIU, reformulated via Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. To solve the resulting problem efficiently, we develop an adaptive inexact column-and-constraint generation (A-iC&CG) algorithm and prove finite-iteration convergence. Case studies on a 47-node DN coupled with a 68-hub transportation network in Shenzhen, China, show that A-iC&CG outperforms benchmark algorithms and that PV-EV hybrid stations are cost-optimal, with RCS siting concentrated near substations and high-flow hubs."}

These applications usually involve navigating at high speeds through constrained spaces such as small gaps. Navigating such constrained spaces becomes particularly challenging when the space is crowded with multiple heterogeneous agents all of which have urgent priorities. What makes the problem even harder is that during an active response situation, roles and priorities can quickly change on a dime without informing the other agents. In order to complete missions in such environments, robots must not only be safe, but also agile, able to dodge and change course at a moment's notice. In this paper, we propose FACA, a fair and agile collision avoidance approach where robots coordinate their tasks by talking to each other via natural language (just as people do). In FACA, robots balance safety with agility via a novel artificial potential field algorithm that creates an automatic ``roundabout'' effect whenever a conflict arises. Our experiments show that FACA achieves a improvement in efficiency, completing missions more than 3.5X faster than baselines with a time reduction of over 70% while maintaining robust safety margins."}

This paper proposes a tri-level, two-stage stochastic-robust optimization (SRO) co-planning framework that jointly determines RCS siting and DN expansion while accounting for transportation flows and population density. The model distinguishes two uncertainty classes: (i) decision-dependent uncertainty (DDU), under which EV charging loads vary with RCS siting; and (ii) decision-independent uncertainty (DIU), under which load fluctuations and renewable-generation variability do not depend on the RCS locations or the DN topology. At the upper level, the framework selects RCS sites and DN expansions. At the middle level, EV routing and charging are dispatched given the RCS siting to produce charging loads DDU. At the lower level, DN operation minimizes annualized loss costs under the worst-case DIU, reformulated via Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. To solve the resulting problem efficiently, we develop an adaptive inexact column-and-constraint generation (A-iC&CG) algorithm and prove finite-iteration convergence. Case studies on a 47-node DN coupled with a 68-hub transportation network in Shenzhen, China, show that A-iC&CG outperforms benchmark algorithms and that PV-EV hybrid stations are cost-optimal, with RCS siting concentrated near substations and high-flow hubs."}

They assumed that the SCMs were learned from purely observational data, leading to an imprecise characterization of the marginal distributions of exogenous variables. Their method leveraged the canonical representation of structural equations to decompose a general SCM with high-cardinality exogenous variables into a set of sub-models with low-cardinality exogenous variables. These sub-models had precise marginals over the exogenous variables and therefore admitted efficient exact inference. The aggregated results were used to bound counterfactual probabilities in the original model. The approach was developed for Markovian models, where each exogenous variable affects only a single endogenous variable. In this paper, we investigate extending the methodology to \\textit{semi-Markovian} SCMs, where exogenous variables may influence multiple endogenous variables. Such models are capable of representing confounding relationships that Markovian models cannot. We illustrate the challenges of this extension using a minimal example, which motivates a set of alternative solution strategies. These strategies are evaluated both theoretically and through a computational study."}

Focusing on Hurricane Beryl in Houston (2024), this study integrates approximately 173000 15-minute outage records with over 1.25 million visits to 3187 food facilities to quantify how infrastructure performance and human access co-evolve. We construct daily indices for outage characteristics (intensity, duration) and food access metrics (redundancy, frequency, proximity), estimate cross-system lags through lagged correlations over zero to seven days, and identify recovery patterns using DTW k-means clustering. Overlaying these clusters yields compound power-access typologies and enables facility-level criticality screening. The analysis reveals a consistent two-day lag: food access reaches its nadir on July 8 at landfall while outage severity peaks around July 10, with negative correlations strongest at a two-day lag and losing significance by day four. We identify four compound typologies from high/low outage crossed with high/low access disruption levels. Road network sparsity, more than income, determines the depth and persistence of access loss. Through this analysis, we enumerate 294 critical food facilities in the study area requiring targeted continuity measures including backup power, microgrids, and feeder prioritization. The novelty lies in measuring interdependency at daily operational resolution while bridging scales from communities to individual facilities, converting dynamic coupling patterns into actionable interventions for phase-sensitive restoration and equity-aware preparedness. The framework is transferable to other lifelines and hazards, offering a generalizable template for diagnosing and mitigating cascading effects on community access during disaster recovery."}

Traditional navigation approaches rely on static Building Information Modeling (BIM) priors or limited onboard perception. In contrast, our framework continuously fuses real-time LiDAR data from aerial and ground robots with BIM priors to maintain an evolving 2D occupancy map. We quantify navigation safety through a unified corridor-risk metric integrating occupancy uncertainty, BIM-map discrepancy, and clearance. When risk exceeds safety thresholds, the UAV autonomously re-scans affected regions to reduce uncertainty and enable safe replanning. Validation in PX4-Gazebo simulation with Robotec GPU LiDAR demonstrates that risk-triggered re-scanning reduces mean corridor risk by 58% and map entropy by 43% compared to static BIM navigation, while maintaining clearance margins above 0.4 m. Compared to frontier-based exploration, our approach achieves similar uncertainty reduction in half the mission time. These results demonstrate that integrating BIM priors with risk-adaptive aerial sensing enables scalable, uncertainty-aware autonomy for construction robotics."}

Pattern-matching systems can encounter issues where exponential time and space are required to find matches for rules with many underconstrained variables, or which produce combinatorial intermediate partial matches (but are otherwise well-constrained). When online AI systems automatically generate rules from example-driven induction or code synthesis, they can easily produce worst-case matching patterns that slow or halt program execution by exceeding available memory. In our own work with cognitive systems that learn from example, we've found that aggressive forms of anti-unification-based generalization can easily produce these circumstances. To make these systems practical without hand-engineering constraints or succumbing to unpredictable failure modes, we introduce a new matching algorithm called CORGI (Collection-Oriented Relational Graph Iteration). Unlike RETE-based approaches, CORGI offers quadratic time and space guarantees for finding single satisficing matches, and the ability to iteratively stream subsequent matches without committing entire conflict sets to memory. CORGI differs from RETE in that it does not have a traditional $β$-memory for collecting partial matches. Instead, CORGI takes a two-step approach: a graph of grounded relations is built/maintained in a forward pass, and an iterator generates matches as needed by working backward through the graph. This approach eliminates the high-latency delays and memory overflows that can result from populating full conflict sets. In a performance evaluation, we demonstrate that CORGI significantly outperforms RETE implementations from SOAR and OPS5 on a simple combinatorial matching task."}

However, traditional VLA models that generate actions through flow matching (FM) typically rely on rigid and uniform time schedules, i.e., synchronous FM (SFM). Without action context awareness and asynchronous self-correction, SFM becomes unstable in long-horizon tasks, where a single action error can cascade into failure. In this work, we propose asynchronous flow matching VLA (AsyncVLA), a novel framework that introduces temporal flexibility in asynchronous FM (AFM) and enables self-correction in action generation. AsyncVLA breaks from the vanilla SFM in VLA models by generating the action tokens in a non-uniform time schedule with action context awareness. Besides, our method introduces the confidence rater to extract confidence of the initially generated actions, enabling the model to selectively refine inaccurate action tokens before execution. Moreover, we propose a unified training procedure for SFM and AFM that endows a single model with both modes, improving KV-cache utilization. Extensive experiments on robotic manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that AsyncVLA is data-efficient and exhibits self-correction ability. AsyncVLA achieves state-of-the-art results across general embodied evaluations due to its asynchronous generation in AFM. Our code is available at https://github.com/YuhuaJiang2002/AsyncVLA."}

Using annual data for 48 countries from 1991-2017, we estimate function-on-function regressions linking poverty headcount ratios to market concentration and other macroeconomic indicators. The results show that, based on the entire sample, stronger competition initially increased poverty during structural adjustment phases, but its adverse impact weakened after 2010 as economies adapted and efficiency gains emerged. The estimated bivariate surfaces reveal that the effect of competition on poverty often persists over multiple years (around 5 years), highlighting the importance of intertemporal transmission. Then, functional clustering based on market capitalization (MCAP) uncovers strong heterogeneity: pro-poor 5-years lagged effect of competition in low- and medium-MCAP economies, while it remains insignificant to weakly negative in high-MCAP countries. Overall, the findings underscore the value of functional data methods in uncovering evolving and lag-dependent poverty-competition linkages that static panel models fail to capture."}

However, existing methods struggle with challenges of scalability and retrieval efficiency, particularly when handling complex, multi-hop questions that require multi-step reasoning. To address these challenges, this paper introduces ALEX (A Light Editing-knowledge Extractor), a lightweight knowledge editing framework. The core innovation of ALEX is its hierarchical memory architecture, which organizes knowledge updates (edits) into semantic clusters. This design fundamentally reduces retrieval complexity from a linear O(N) to a highly scalable O(K+N/C). Furthermore, the framework integrates an Inferential Query Synthesis (IQS) module to bridge the semantic gap between queries and facts , and a Dynamic Evidence Adjudication (DEA) engine that executes an efficient two-stage retrieval process. Experiments on the MQUAKE benchmark demonstrate that ALEX significantly improves both the accuracy of multi-hop answers (MultiHop-ACC) and the reliability of reasoning paths (HopWise-ACC). It also reduces the required search space by over 80% , presenting a promising path toward building scalable, efficient, and accurate knowledge editing systems."}

However, this interaction is complex in two key aspects: (1) the motion involved, and (2) the non-linear behaviour of soft tissues. Multiple approaches have been undertaken to better understand this interaction and to improve the quantitative metrics of physical interfaces or cuffs. As these two topics are closely interrelated, finite modelling and soft tissue characterisation offer valuable insights into pressure distribution and shear stress induced by the cuff. Nevertheless, current characterisation methods typically rely on a single fitting variable along one degree of freedom, which limits their applicability, given that interactions with wearable robots often involve multiple degrees of freedom. To address this limitation, this work introduces a dual-variable characterisation method, involving normal and tangential forces, aimed at identifying reliable material parameters and evaluating the impact of single-variable fitting on force and torque responses. This method demonstrates the importance of incorporating two variables into the characterisation process by analysing the normalized mean square error (NMSE) across different scenarios and material models, providing a foundation for simulation at the closest possible level, with a focus on the cuff and the human limb involved in the physical interaction between the user and the wearable robot."}

While the role of AI in such situations is gaining attention for making optimal decisions within limited resources and time, its development and performance evaluation require benchmark datasets of sufficient quantity and quality. However, MCIs occur infrequently, and sufficient records are difficult to accumulate at the scene, making it challenging to collect large-scale realworld data for research use. Therefore, we developed Syn-STARTS, a framework that uses LLMs to generate triage cases, and verified its effectiveness. The results showed that the triage cases generated by Syn-STARTS were qualitatively indistinguishable from the TRIAGE open dataset generated by manual curation from training materials. Furthermore, when evaluating the LLM accuracy using hundreds of cases each from the green, yellow, red, and black categories defined by the standard triage method START, the results were found to be highly stable. This strongly indicates the possibility of synthetic data in developing high-performance AI models for severe and critical medical situations."}

In pursuit of this objective, we put forward a novel structured map representation. By discretizing the spatial data and integrating the boundary points and the historical trajectory, the structured map succinctly and effectively encapsulates the visited regions, thereby serving as input for the deep reinforcement learning based decision module.

The result is a tractable and auditable controller that closes the diagnostic-pedagogical loop and delivers equitable, load-aware personalization at classroom scale."}

This problem is interesting because LLMs often hallucinate when direct evidence to answer a question is lacking, and these effects become more pronounced in a network of interacting LLMs. The hallucination spreads, causing previously accurate LLMs to hallucinate. We study interacting LLMs and their hallucination by combining novel ideas of mean-field dynamics (MFD) from network science and the randomized utility model from economics to construct a useful generative model. We model the LLM with a latent state that indicates if it is truthful or not with respect to the ground truth, and extend a tractable analytical model considering an MFD to model the diffusion of information in a directed network of LLMs. To specify the probabilities that govern the dynamics of the MFD, we propose a randomized utility model. For a network of LLMs, where each LLM has two possible latent states, we posit sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of a fixed point and analyze the behavior of the fixed point in terms of the incentive (e.g., test-time compute) given to individual LLMs. We experimentally study and analyze the behavior of a network of $100$ open-source LLMs with respect to data heterogeneity, node capability, network structure, and sensitivity to framing on multiple semi-synthetic datasets."}

However, crafting satisfactory designs is time-intensive for designers: they need to consider which controls and content to present on the page, and then repeatedly adjust their size, position, and style for better aesthetics and structure. Although many design software can now help to perform these repetitive tasks, extensive training is needed to use them effectively. Moreover, collaborative design across app pages demands extra time to align standards and ensure consistent styling. In this work, we propose APD-agents, a large language model (LLM) driven multi-agent framework for automated page design in mobile applications. Our framework contains OrchestratorAgent, SemanticParserAgent, PrimaryLayoutAgent, TemplateRetrievalAgent, and RecursiveComponentAgent. Upon receiving the user's description of the page, the OrchestratorAgent can dynamically can direct other agents to accomplish users' design task. To be specific, the SemanticParserAgent is responsible for converting users' descriptions of page content into structured data. The PrimaryLayoutAgent can generate an initial coarse-grained layout of this page. The TemplateRetrievalAgent can fetch semantically relevant few-shot examples and enhance the quality of layout generation. Besides, a RecursiveComponentAgent can be used to decide how to recursively generate all the fine-grained sub-elements it contains for each element in the layout. Our work fully leverages the automatic collaboration capabilities of large-model-driven multi-agent systems. Experimental results on the RICO dataset show that our APD-agents achieve state-of-the-art performance."}

Overcoming compounding errors in sequential action decisions remains a central challenge to improving BC performance. Existing approaches mitigate compounding errors through data augmentation, expressive representation, or temporal abstraction. However, they suffer from physical discontinuities and semantic-physical misalignment, leading to inaccurate action cloning and intermittent execution. In this paper, we present Continuous vision-language-action Co-Learning with Semantic-Physical Alignment (CCoL), a novel BC framework that ensures temporally consistent execution and fine-grained semantic grounding. It generates robust and smooth action execution trajectories through continuous co-learning across vision, language, and proprioceptive inputs (e.g., robot internal states). Meanwhile, we anchor language semantics to visuomotor representations by a bidirectional cross-attention to learn contextual information for action generation, successfully overcoming the problem of semantic-physical misalignment. Extensive experiments show that CCoL achieves an average 8.0% relative improvement across three simulation suites, with up to 19.2% relative gain in human-demonstrated bimanual insertion tasks. Real-world tests on a 7-DoF robot further confirm CCoL's generalization under unseen and noisy object states."}

MSDP is based on masked autoencoding and trains a transformer-based encoder by reconstructing multisensory observations from only a subset of sensor embeddings, leading to cross-modal prediction and sensor fusion. For downstream policy learning, we introduce a novel asymmetric architecture, where a cross-attention mechanism allows the critic to extract dynamic, task-specific features from the frozen embeddings, while the actor receives a stable pooled representation to guide its actions. Our method demonstrates accelerated learning and robust performance under diverse perturbations, including sensor noise, and changes in object dynamics. Evaluations in multiple challenging, contact-rich robot manipulation tasks in simulation and the real world showcase the effectiveness of MSDP. Our approach exhibits strong robustness to perturbations and achieves high success rates on the real robot with as few as 6,000 online interactions, offering a simple yet powerful solution for complex multisensory robotic control."}

Recent research underscores the potential of harnessing large language models (LLMs) for VLN, given their commonsense knowledge and general reasoning capabilities. Despite their strengths, a substantial gap in task completion performance persists between LLM-based approaches and domain experts, as LLMs inherently struggle to comprehend real-world spatial correlations precisely. Additionally, introducing LLMs is accompanied with substantial computational cost and inference latency. To address these issues, we propose a novel dual-process thinking framework dubbed R3, integrating LLMs' generalization capabilities with VLN-specific expertise in a zero-shot manner. The framework comprises three core modules: Runner, Ruminator, and Regulator. The Runner is a lightweight transformer-based expert model that ensures efficient and accurate navigation under regular circumstances. The Ruminator employs a powerful multimodal LLM as the backbone and adopts chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to elicit structured reasoning. The Regulator monitors the navigation progress and controls the appropriate thinking mode according to three criteria, integrating Runner and Ruminator harmoniously. Experimental results illustrate that R3 significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, exceeding 3.28% and 3.30% in SPL and RGSPL respectively on the REVERIE benchmark. This pronounced enhancement highlights the effectiveness of our method in handling challenging VLN tasks."}

However, traditional mutation operators are poorly suited to robotic programs, which involve message-based commands and interactions with the physical world. This paper explores the adaptation of mutation testing to IRS by defining domain-specific mutation operators that capture the semantics of robot actions and sensor readings.

Electric grid operators, however, have limited knowledge of the reliability risks of data center interconnection due to their unique operational characteristics. An emerging concern is the sub-synchronous resonance (SSR) which refer to unexpected voltage/current oscillations at typical frequencies below 60/50 Hz. It remains unknown whether and how the interactions between data centers and the grid may trigger resonances, equipment damages, and even cascading failures. In this paper, we focus on grid-connected data centers that draw electricity from the grid through power factor correction (PFC) converters. We conduct two-tone frequency sweep to investigate the data centers' impedance characteristics, i.e. magnitude and phase angle variations over frequencies, and showcase their deep dependence on compute workloads. The impedance modeling provides a direct approach to evaluating SSR risks and enable a cooperative mechanism to alarm and avoid resonance-prone situations. Building upon the impedance, a data-driven preventive controller is then established to raise early warnings of risky operation and suggest flexible workload management according to the given grid conditions. Through case study, we demonstrate how to use impedance to understand the unexpected interactions. Data-driven impedance is validated to show decent performance in capturing the unique impedance dips and tracking the impedance variations across a range of workload scenarios. The early warning and preventive control approaches are further effective to improve the safety margins with minimal workload rescheduling. The key findings of this work will provide valuable insights for grid operators and data center managers, and support preparation for future scenarios involving large-scale data center integration."}

Electric grid operators, however, have limited knowledge of the reliability risks of data center interconnection due to their unique operational characteristics. An emerging concern is the sub-synchronous resonance (SSR) which refer to unexpected voltage/current oscillations at typical frequencies below 60/50 Hz. It remains unknown whether and how the interactions between data centers and the grid may trigger resonances, equipment damages, and even cascading failures. In this paper, we focus on grid-connected data centers that draw electricity from the grid through power factor correction (PFC) converters. We conduct two-tone frequency sweep to investigate the data centers' impedance characteristics, i.e. magnitude and phase angle variations over frequencies, and showcase their deep dependence on compute workloads. The impedance modeling provides a direct approach to evaluating SSR risks and enable a cooperative mechanism to alarm and avoid resonance-prone situations. Building upon the impedance, a data-driven preventive controller is then established to raise early warnings of risky operation and suggest flexible workload management according to the given grid conditions. Through case study, we demonstrate how to use impedance to understand the unexpected interactions. Data-driven impedance is validated to show decent performance in capturing the unique impedance dips and tracking the impedance variations across a range of workload scenarios. The early warning and preventive control approaches are further effective to improve the safety margins with minimal workload rescheduling. The key findings of this work will provide valuable insights for grid operators and data center managers, and support preparation for future scenarios involving large-scale data center integration."}

Traditional centralized machine learning struggles with the distributed data and privacy concerns in these heterogeneous environments, while existing federated learning approaches suffer from high costs and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we propose HFL-FlowLLM, which to our knowledge is the first framework to apply large language models to network traffic flow classification in heterogeneous federated learning. Compared to state-of-the-art heterogeneous federated learning methods for network traffic flow classification, the proposed approach improves the average F1 score by approximately 13%, demonstrating compelling performance and strong robustness. When compared to existing large language models federated learning frameworks, as the number of clients participating in each training round increases, the proposed method achieves up to a 5% improvement in average F1 score while reducing the training costs by about 87%. These findings prove the potential and practical value of HFL-FlowLLM in modern communication networks security."}

We test this fundamental question with a series of chronological ordering tasks with increasing complexities over facts the model already knows from pre-training. Our tasks cover (1) chronological ordering, (2) conditional sorting (filter, then order), and (3) anachronism detection. We evaluate GPT-4.1, Claude-3.7 Sonnet, with and without Extended Thinking (ET), and GPT-5 across multiple reasoning-effort settings. Across models, Exact match rate drops sharply as sequences lengthen even while rank correlations stay high as LLMs largely preserve local order but struggle to maintain a single globally consistent timeline. In conditional sorting, most failures stem from the filtering step rather than the ordering step, but GPT-5 and Claude-3.7 Sonnet with Extended Thinking outshine normal models significantly. Lastly, anachronism detection is found to be the easiest task for the LLMs but performance still declines with increasingly overlapping timelines or entities. Overall, our main contribution is showing that allocating explicit reasoning budget helps with chronological ordering with GPT-5 at medium/high reasoning effort achieving flawless ordering at all lengths and perfect conditional sorting (both self-filtered and given-subset), whereas low/minimal effort degrades with longer lists, mirroring earlier models. Our findings delineate limits of current LLMs on chronological tasks, providing insights into task complexity, and demonstrate scenarios in which reasoning helps. These patterns are important for the real-time application of LLMs in finance. We release all code and evaluation templates to support full reproducibility."}

The UAV flies autonomously within an obstacle-free flight funnel derived from geodata, detecting and localizing heat sources. An operator supervises the operation on a handheld controller and selects a fire target in reach. After the selection, the UAV automatically plans and traverses between two triangulation poses for continued fire localization. Simultaneously, our system steers the fire monitor to ensure the water jet reaches the detected heat source. In preliminary tests, our assistance system successfully localized multiple heat sources and directed a water jet towards the fires."}

However, it frequently suffers from hallucination errors, especially under noisy acoustic conditions. Previous works to reduce hallucinations in Whisper-style ASR systems have primarily focused on audio preprocessing or post-processing of transcriptions to filter out erroneous content. However, modifications to the Whisper model itself remain largely unexplored to mitigate hallucinations directly. To address this challenge, we present a two-stage architecture that first enhances encoder robustness through Adaptive Layer Attention (ALA) and further suppresses hallucinations using a multi-objective knowledge distillation (KD) framework. In the first stage, ALA groups encoder layers into semantically coherent blocks via inter-layer correlation analysis. A learnable multi-head attention module then fuses these block representations, enabling the model to jointly exploit low- and high-level features for more robust encoding. In the second stage, our KD framework trains the student model on noisy audio to align its semantic and attention distributions with a teacher model processing clean inputs. Our experiments on noisy speech benchmarks show notable reductions in hallucinations and word error rates, while preserving performance on clean speech. Together, ALA and KD offer a principled strategy to improve Whisper's reliability under real-world noisy conditions."}

This happens because demonstrations show robots how to do a task but not what matters for that task, causing the model to focus on irrelevant state details. Natural language can more directly specify what the robot should focus on, and, in principle, disambiguate between many reward functions consistent with the demonstrations. However, existing language-conditioned reward learning methods typically treat instructions as simple conditioning signals, without fully exploiting their potential to resolve ambiguity. Moreover, real instructions are often ambiguous themselves, so naive conditioning is unreliable. Our key insight is that these two input types carry complementary information: demonstrations show how to act, while language specifies what is important. We propose Masked Inverse Reinforcement Learning (Masked IRL), a framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to combine the strengths of both input types. Masked IRL infers state-relevance masks from language instructions and enforces invariance to irrelevant state components. When instructions are ambiguous, it uses LLM reasoning to clarify them in the context of the demonstrations. In simulation and on a real robot, Masked IRL outperforms prior language-conditioned IRL methods by up to 15% while using up to 4.7 times less data, demonstrating improved sample-efficiency, generalization, and robustness to ambiguous language.

DSBench encompasses two major categories: external environmental risks and in-cabin driving behavior safety, divided into 10 key categories and a total of 28 sub-categories. This comprehensive evaluation covers a wide range of scenarios, ensuring a thorough assessment of VLMs' performance in safety-critical contexts. Extensive evaluations across various mainstream open-source and closed-source VLMs reveal significant performance degradation under complex safety-critical situations, highlighting urgent safety concerns. To address this, we constructed a large dataset of 98K instances focused on in-cabin and external safety scenarios, showing that fine-tuning on this dataset significantly enhances the safety performance of existing VLMs and paves the way for advancing autonomous driving technology.

Accurately forecasting regional Airbnb market trends can thus offer critical insights for policymakers and urban planners aiming to mitigate these impacts. This study proposes a novel time-series forecasting framework to predict three key Airbnb indicators -- Revenue, Reservation Days, and Number of Reservations -- at the regional level. Using a sliding-window approach, the model forecasts trends 1 to 3 months ahead. Unlike prior studies that focus on individual listings at fixed time points, our approach constructs regional representations by integrating listing features with external contextual factors such as urban accessibility and human mobility. We convert structured tabular data into prompt-based inputs for a Large Language Model (LLM), producing comprehensive regional embeddings. These embeddings are then fed into advanced time-series models (RNN, LSTM, Transformer) to better capture complex spatio-temporal dynamics. Experiments on Seoul's Airbnb dataset show that our method reduces both average RMSE and MAE by approximately 48% compared to conventional baselines, including traditional statistical and machine learning models. Our framework not only improves forecasting accuracy but also offers practical insights for detecting oversupplied regions and supporting data-driven urban policy decisions."}

Despite promising success, current LLM-based KGR methods still face two critical limitations. First, existing methods often extract reasoning paths indiscriminately, without assessing their different importance, which may introduce irrelevant noise that misleads LLMs. Second, while many methods leverage LLMs to dynamically explore potential reasoning paths, they require high retrieval demands and frequent LLM calls. To address these limitations, we propose PathMind, a novel framework designed to enhance faithful and interpretable reasoning by selectively guiding LLMs with important reasoning paths. Specifically, PathMind follows a \"Retrieve-Prioritize-Reason\" paradigm. First, it retrieves a query subgraph from KG through the retrieval module. Next, it introduces a path prioritization mechanism that identifies important reasoning paths using a semantic-aware path priority function, which simultaneously considers the accumulative cost and the estimated future cost for reaching the target. Finally, PathMind generates accurate and logically consistent responses via a dual-phase training strategy, including task-specific instruction tuning and path-wise preference alignment. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that PathMind consistently outperforms competitive baselines, particularly on complex reasoning tasks with fewer input tokens, by identifying essential reasoning paths."}

In this work, we introduce NORA-1.5, a VLA model built from the pre-trained NORA backbone by adding to it a flow-matching-based action expert. This architectural enhancement alone yields substantial performance gains, enabling NORA-1.5 to outperform NORA and several state-of-the-art VLA models across both simulated and real-world benchmarks. To further improve robustness and task success, we develop a set of reward models for post-training VLA policies. Our rewards combine (i) an action-conditioned world model (WM) that evaluates whether generated actions lead toward the desired goal, and (ii) a deviation-from-ground-truth heuristic that distinguishes good actions from poor ones. Using these reward signals, we construct preference datasets and adapt NORA-1.5 to target embodiments through direct preference optimization (DPO). Extensive evaluations show that reward-driven post-training consistently improves performance in both simulation and real-robot settings, demonstrating significant VLA model-reliability gains through simple yet effective reward models. Our findings highlight NORA-1.5 and reward-guided post-training as a viable path toward more dependable embodied agents suitable for real-world deployment."}

Unfortunately, the verification of such systems remains challenging, largely due to the complexity of the controllers, which are often nonlinear, nonconvex, learning-based, and/or black-box. Prior works propose verification algorithms that are based on approximate reachability methods, but they often restrict the class of controllers and systems that can be handled or result in overly conservative analyses. Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis is a popular formal verification tool for general nonlinear systems that can compute optimal reachable sets under worst-case system uncertainties; however, its application to perception-based systems is currently underexplored. In this work, we propose RoVer-CoRe, a framework for the Robust Verification of Controllers via HJ Reachability. To the best of our knowledge, RoVer-CoRe is the first HJ reachability-based framework for the verification of perception-based systems under perceptual uncertainty. Our key insight is to concatenate the system controller, observation function, and the state estimation modules to obtain an equivalent closed-loop system that is readily compatible with existing reachability frameworks. Within RoVer-CoRe, we propose novel methods for formal safety verification and robust controller design. We demonstrate the efficacy of the framework in case studies involving aircraft taxiing and NN-based rover navigation. Code is available at the link in the footnote."}

Large language models appear to bring this vision closer, showing impressive results in automatically generating models for classical benchmarks. However, much of this apparent success may derive from data contamination rather than genuine reasoning: many standard CP problems are likely included in the training data of these models. To examine this hypothesis, we systematically rephrased and perturbed a set of well-known CSPLib problems to preserve their structure while modifying their context and introducing misleading elements. We then compared the models produced by three representative LLMs across original and modified descriptions. Our qualitative analysis shows that while LLMs can produce syntactically valid and semantically plausible models, their performance drops sharply under contextual and linguistic variation, revealing shallow understanding and sensitivity to wording."}

We first introduce an interface, HMC-Controller, for blending actions from different control profiles continuously in the torque space. HMC-Controller facilitates both teleoperation and policy deployment. Then, to learn a robust force-aware policy, we propose HMC-Policy to unify different controllers into a heterogeneous architecture. We adopt a mixture-of-experts style routing to learn from large-scale position-only data and fine-grained force-aware demonstrations.

This study examines how incorporating pluralistic values affects LLM behavior by systematically evaluating demographic variation and design parameters in the alignment pipeline. We collected alignment data from US and German participants (N = 1,095, 27,375 ratings) who rated LLM responses across five dimensions: Toxicity, Emotional Awareness (EA), Sensitivity, Stereotypical Bias, and Helpfulness. We fine-tuned multiple Large Language Models and Large Reasoning Models using preferences from different social groups while varying rating scales, disagreement handling methods, and optimization techniques. The results revealed systematic demographic effects: male participants rated responses 18% less toxic than female participants; conservative and Black participants rated responses 27.9% and 44% more emotionally aware than liberal and White participants, respectively. Models fine-tuned on group-specific preferences exhibited distinct behaviors. Technical design choices showed strong effects: the preservation of rater disagreement achieved roughly 53% greater toxicity reduction than majority voting, and 5-point scales yielded about 22% more reduction than binary formats; and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) consistently outperformed Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) in multi-value optimization. These findings represent a preliminary step in answering a critical question: How should alignment balance expert-driven and user-driven signals to ensure both safety and fair representation?"}

In this work, we propose AutoTool, a novel graph-based framework that bypasses repeated LLM inference by exploiting a key empirical observation: tool usage inertia - the tendency of tool invocations to follow predictable sequential patterns. AutoTool constructs a directed graph from historical agent trajectories, where nodes represent tools and edges capture transition probabilities, effectively modeling the inertia in tool selection. It further integrates parameter-level information to refine tool input generation. By traversing this structured representation, AutoTool efficiently selects tools and their parameters with minimal reliance on LLM inference. Extensive experiments across diverse agent tasks demonstrate that AutoTool reduces inference costs by up to 30% while maintaining competitive task completion rates, offering a practical and scalable enhancement for inference-heavy frameworks. Our work highlights the promise of integrating statistical structure into LLM agent design for greater efficiency without sacrificing performance."}

Effective prompts should meet three principles: focus on decision-critical information, provide step-level granularity, and minimize reliance on expert annotations through label efficiency. However, existing ICL methods often fail to satisfy all three criteria simultaneously. Motivated by these challenges, we introduce SkillGen, a skill-based ICL framework for structured sequential reasoning. It constructs an action-centric, domain-level graph from sampled trajectories, identifies high-utility actions via temporal-difference credit assignment, and retrieves step-wise skills to generate fine-grained, context-aware prompts. We further present a theoretical analysis showing that focusing on high-utility segments supports task identifiability and informs more effective ICL prompt design. Experiments on ALFWorld, BabyAI, and ScienceWorld, using both open-source and proprietary LLMs, show that SkillGen achieves consistent gains, improving progress rate by 5.9%-16.5% on average across models."}

These challenges make conventional optimization and value-based RL approaches computationally inefficient and difficult to scale. This paper applies a Heterogeneous-Agent Reinforcement Learning (HARL) framework, instantiated through Heterogeneous-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (HAPPO), to enable coordinated restoration across interconnected microgrids. Each agent controls a distinct microgrid with different loads, DER capacities, and switch counts, introducing practical structural heterogeneity. Decentralized actor policies are trained with a centralized critic to compute advantage values for stable on-policy updates. A physics-informed OpenDSS environment provides full power flow feedback and enforces operational limits via differentiable penalty signals rather than invalid action masking. The total DER generation is capped at 2400 kW, and each microgrid must satisfy local supply-demand feasibility. Experiments on the IEEE 123-bus and IEEE 8500-node systems show that HAPPO achieves faster convergence, higher restored power, and smoother multi-seed training than DQN, PPO, MAES, MAGDPG, MADQN, Mean-Field RL, and QMIX. Results demonstrate that incorporating microgrid-level heterogeneity within the HARL framework yields a scalable, stable, and constraint-aware solution for complex PDS restoration."}

This paper introduces a principled approach to quantify distribution shift by representing traffic scenarios as demand histograms and comparing them with a GEH-based distance function. The method is policy-independent, interpretable, and leverages a widely used traffic engineering statistic. We validate the approach on 20 simulated scenarios using both a NEMA actuated controller and a reinforcement learning controller (FRAP++). Results show that larger scenario distances consistently correspond to increased travel time and reduced throughput, with particularly strong explanatory power for learning-based control. Overall, this method can predict performance degradation under distribution shift better than previously published techniques. These findings highlight the utility of the proposed framework for benchmarking, training regime design, and monitoring in adaptive traffic signal control."}

Accordingly, it remains unclear how and to what extent AI can accelerate innovation. To help to fill this gap, we report results from 32 interviews with U.S.-based academic manufacturing and materials sciences researchers experienced with AI and machine learning (ML) techniques. Interviewees primarily used AI for modeling of materials and manufacturing processes, facilitating cheaper and more rapid search of design spaces for materials and manufacturing processes alike. They report benefits including cost, time, and computation savings in technology development. However, interviewees also report that AI/ML tools are unreliable outside design spaces for which dense data are already available; that they require skilled and judicious application in tandem with older research techniques; and that AI/ML tools may detrimentally circumvent opportunities for disruptive theoretical advancement.

However, traditional VLA models that generate actions through flow matching (FM) typically rely on rigid and uniform time schedules, i.e., synchronous FM (SFM). Without action context awareness and asynchronous self-correction, SFM becomes unstable in long-horizon tasks, where a single action error can cascade into failure. In this work, we propose asynchronous flow matching VLA (AsyncVLA), a novel framework that introduces temporal flexibility in asynchronous FM (AFM) and enables self-correction in action generation. AsyncVLA breaks from the vanilla SFM in VLA models by generating the action tokens in a non-uniform time schedule with action context awareness. Besides, our method introduces the confidence rater to extract confidence of the initially generated actions, enabling the model to selectively refine inaccurate action tokens before execution. Moreover, we propose a unified training procedure for SFM and AFM that endows a single model with both modes, improving KV-cache utilization. Extensive experiments on robotic manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that AsyncVLA is data-efficient and exhibits self-correction ability. AsyncVLA achieves state-of-the-art results across general embodied evaluations due to its asynchronous generation in AFM. Our code is available at https://github.com/YuhuaJiang2002/AsyncVLA."}

Overcoming compounding errors in sequential action decisions remains a central challenge to improving BC performance. Existing approaches mitigate compounding errors through data augmentation, expressive representation, or temporal abstraction. However, they suffer from physical discontinuities and semantic-physical misalignment, leading to inaccurate action cloning and intermittent execution. In this paper, we present Continuous vision-language-action Co-Learning with Semantic-Physical Alignment (CCoL), a novel BC framework that ensures temporally consistent execution and fine-grained semantic grounding. It generates robust and smooth action execution trajectories through continuous co-learning across vision, language, and proprioceptive inputs (e.g., robot internal states). Meanwhile, we anchor language semantics to visuomotor representations by a bidirectional cross-attention to learn contextual information for action generation, successfully overcoming the problem of semantic-physical misalignment. Extensive experiments show that CCoL achieves an average 8.0% relative improvement across three simulation suites, with up to 19.2% relative gain in human-demonstrated bimanual insertion tasks. Real-world tests on a 7-DoF robot further confirm CCoL's generalization under unseen and noisy object states."}

This happens because demonstrations show robots how to do a task but not what matters for that task, causing the model to focus on irrelevant state details. Natural language can more directly specify what the robot should focus on, and, in principle, disambiguate between many reward functions consistent with the demonstrations. However, existing language-conditioned reward learning methods typically treat instructions as simple conditioning signals, without fully exploiting their potential to resolve ambiguity. Moreover, real instructions are often ambiguous themselves, so naive conditioning is unreliable. Our key insight is that these two input types carry complementary information: demonstrations show how to act, while language specifies what is important. We propose Masked Inverse Reinforcement Learning (Masked IRL), a framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to combine the strengths of both input types. Masked IRL infers state-relevance masks from language instructions and enforces invariance to irrelevant state components. When instructions are ambiguous, it uses LLM reasoning to clarify them in the context of the demonstrations. In simulation and on a real robot, Masked IRL outperforms prior language-conditioned IRL methods by up to 15% while using up to 4.7 times less data, demonstrating improved sample-efficiency, generalization, and robustness to ambiguous language.

DSBench encompasses two major categories: external environmental risks and in-cabin driving behavior safety, divided into 10 key categories and a total of 28 sub-categories. This comprehensive evaluation covers a wide range of scenarios, ensuring a thorough assessment of VLMs' performance in safety-critical contexts. Extensive evaluations across various mainstream open-source and closed-source VLMs reveal significant performance degradation under complex safety-critical situations, highlighting urgent safety concerns.

In practice, such assumptions frequently break down since airspace sectors operate independently and prioritize local objectives. We address the problem of sector overload in decentralized air traffic management by proposing a mechanism that models self-interested behaviors based on best response dynamics. Each sector adjusts the departure times of flights under its control to reduce its own congestion, without any shared decision making. A tunable cooperativeness factor models the degree to which each sector is willing to reduce overload in other sectors. We prove that the proposed mechanism satisfies a potential game structure, ensuring that best response dynamics converge to a pure Nash equilibrium, under a mild restriction. In addition, we identify a sufficient condition under which an overload-free solution corresponds to a global minimizer of the potential function. Numerical experiments using 24 hours of European flight data demonstrate that the proposed algorithm substantially reduces overload even with only minimal cooperation between sectors, while maintaining scalability and matching the solution quality of centralized solvers."}

This paper proposes a tri-level, two-stage stochastic-robust optimization (SRO) co-planning framework that jointly determines RCS siting and DN expansion while accounting for transportation flows and population density. The model distinguishes two uncertainty classes: (i) decision-dependent uncertainty (DDU), under which EV charging loads vary with RCS siting; and (ii) decision-independent uncertainty (DIU), under which load fluctuations and renewable-generation variability do not depend on the RCS locations or the DN topology. At the upper level, the framework selects RCS sites and DN expansions. At the middle level, EV routing and charging are dispatched given the RCS siting to produce charging loads DDU. At the lower level, DN operation minimizes annualized loss costs under the worst-case DIU, reformulated via Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. To solve the resulting problem efficiently, we develop an adaptive inexact column-and-constraint generation (A-iC&CG) algorithm and prove finite-iteration convergence.

To test this hypothesis and systematically probe current VLM spatial reasoning mechanisms, we introduce SpatiaLite, a fully synthetic benchmark that jointly measures spatial reasoning accuracy and reasoning efficiency. Comprehensive experiments reveal three key findings. First, advanced VLMs predominantly rely on linguistic representations for reasoning and imagination, resulting in significant deficiencies on visual centric tasks that demand perceptual spatial relations and 3D geometry transformations such as mental rotation or projection prediction. Second, advanced VLMs exhibit severe inefficiency in their current spatial reasoning mechanisms, with token usage growing rapidly as transformation complexity increases. Third, we propose an Imagery Driven Framework (IDF) for data synthesis and training, which can implicitly construct an internal world model that is critical for spatial reasoning in VLMs. Building on SpatiaLite, this work delineates the spatial reasoning limits and patterns of advanced VLMs, identifies key shortcomings, and informs future advances"}

We validate the approach on 20 simulated scenarios using both a NEMA actuated controller and a reinforcement learning controller (FRAP++). Results show that larger scenario distances consistently correspond to increased travel time and reduced throughput, with particularly strong explanatory power for learning-based control.

In this paper, we apply an information flow-based modeling framework to a real-world recruitment process that integrates automated candidate matching with human decision-making. Through semi-structured stakeholder interviews and iterative modeling, we construct a multi-level representation of the recruitment pipeline, capturing how information is transformed, filtered, and interpreted across both algorithmic and human components. We identify where biases may emerge, how they can propagate through the system, and what downstream impacts they may have on candidates. This case study illustrates how information flow modeling can support structured analysis of fairness risks, providing transparency across complex socio-technical systems."}

A key factor influencing MFC performance is the anode structure, where design and material properties play a crucial role. Existing predictive models struggle to capture the complex geometric dependencies necessary to optimize these structures. To solve this problem, we propose KANGURA: Kolmogorov-Arnold Network-Based Geometry-Aware Learning with Unified Representation Attention. KANGURA introduces a new approach to three-dimensional (3D) machine learning modeling. It formulates prediction as a function decomposition problem, where Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN)- based representation learning reconstructs geometric relationships without a conventional multi- layer perceptron (MLP). To refine spatial understanding, geometry-disentangled representation learning separates structural variations into interpretable components, while unified attention mechanisms dynamically enhance critical geometric regions. Experimental results demonstrate that KANGURA outperforms over 15 state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on the ModelNet40 benchmark dataset, achieving 92.7% accuracy, and excels in a real-world MFC anode structure problem with 97% accuracy. This establishes KANGURA as a robust framework for 3D geometric modeling, unlocking new possibilities for optimizing complex structures in advanced manufacturing and quality-driven engineering applications."}

Strategic scheduling of transformer upgrades to antici- pate increasing loads can avoid operational failures and reduce the risk of supply shortages. This work proposes a framework to prioritize transformer upgrades based on predicted loads at each meter, including heat pumps and electric vehicle chargers. The framework follows a Monte Carlo approach to forecasting, generating many possible loading instances and collecting a distribution of failure probabilities for each transformer. In each loading instance, heat pumps and EVs are added stochastically to each meter over time, based on an overall estimated growth rate and factors specific to each customer. We set heat pump load profiles by temperature and EV load profiles based on a stochastic driving model and charging pattern. The load profiles feed into network topology and transformer failure models to calculate failure probabilities.We formulate a cost optimization based on these failure probabilities to schedule transformer upgrades. We demonstrate this approach on a real-world distribution feeder in rural Vermont under low, medium, and high-electrification scenarios. We find generally less than 20% of transformers having substantial risk of failure over a 20-year simulation. Lastly, we develop an optimization routine to schedule upgrades and discuss the expected number of failures."}

They assumed that the SCMs were learned from purely observational data, leading to an imprecise characterization of the marginal distributions of exogenous variables. Their method leveraged the canonical representation of structural equations to decompose a general SCM with high-cardinality exogenous variables into a set of sub-models with low-cardinality exogenous variables. These sub-models had precise marginals over the exogenous variables and therefore admitted efficient exact inference. The aggregated results were used to bound counterfactual probabilities in the original model. The approach was developed for Markovian models, where each exogenous variable affects only a single endogenous variable. In this paper, we investigate extending the methodology to \\textit{semi-Markovian} SCMs, where exogenous variables may influence multiple endogenous variables. Such models are capable of representing confounding relationships that Markovian models cannot. We illustrate the challenges of this extension using a minimal example, which motivates a set of alternative solution strategies. These strategies are evaluated both theoretically and through a computational study."}

Due to the random sparsification that selects only a subset of the state components at each step, we analyze the stability of the closed-loop system in terms of Asymptotic Mean-Square Stability (AMSS), which ensures that the system state converges to zero in the mean-square sense. We consider the problem of designing both a feedback gain matrix and a measurement sparsification strategy that minimizes the number of state components required for feedback, while ensuring AMSS of the closed-loop system. Interestingly, (1) we provide conditions on the dynamics of the system under which it is possible to find a sparsification strategy, and (2) we propose a Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) based algorithm that jointly computes a stabilizing gain matrix, and a randomized sparsification strategy that minimizes the expected number of measured state coordinates while preserving the AMSS. Our approach is then extended to the case where the sparsification probabilities vary across the state components. Based on these theoretical findings, we propose an algorithmic procedure to compute the vector of sparsification parameters, along with the corresponding feedback gain matrix. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the stability properties of control systems that rely solely on randomly selected state measurements. Numerical simulations demonstrate that, in some settings, the system achieves comparable performance to full-state feedback while requiring measurements from only $0.3\\%$ of the state coordinates."}

An actor can support balancing actively by bidding into reserve markets, or passively by adjusting its portfolio in line with system needs. In some countries, BRPs are incentivized to engage in passive balancing when their deviations support overall system stability. However, BRPs focus on profit maximization rather than minimizing portfolio discrepancies, which can cause simultaneous responses to price signals and create issues at the transmission-distribution interface. This research provides a two-stage stochastic model that captures BRP dynamic behavior and their impact on the grid under day-ahead and balancing market price uncertainty across three imbalance pricing mechanisms: the single, dual, and two-price. Then, a congestion-dependent imbalance pricing mechanism is proposed that maintains incentives for passive balancing while satisfying the grid constraint. A proof of concept is provided via the simulation with a part of the Dutch distribution grid. Results show that the proposed method mitigates the unexpected peak flow issue in congested areas while preserving passive balancing contributions from other BRPs in non-congested areas."}

One algorithm enhances information security by requiring agents to share only a dissipativity characterization, not a dynamical model, for stability analysis. A second algorithm further restricts this information sharing to their clique, thereby enhancing security, and can also reduce the computational burden of stability analysis if the network allows chordal decomposition. The convergence of the proposed algorithms is demonstrated, and criteria are identified for decomposable networks facilitating chordal decomposition.

Pattern-matching systems can encounter issues where exponential time and space are required to find matches for rules with many underconstrained variables, or which produce combinatorial intermediate partial matches (but are otherwise well-constrained). When online AI systems automatically generate rules from example-driven induction or code synthesis, they can easily produce worst-case matching patterns that slow or halt program execution by exceeding available memory. In our own work with cognitive systems that learn from example, we've found that aggressive forms of anti-unification-based generalization can easily produce these circumstances. To make these systems practical without hand-engineering constraints or succumbing to unpredictable failure modes, we introduce a new matching algorithm called CORGI (Collection-Oriented Relational Graph Iteration). Unlike RETE-based approaches, CORGI offers quadratic time and space guarantees for finding single satisficing matches, and the ability to iteratively stream subsequent matches without committing entire conflict sets to memory. CORGI differs from RETE in that it does not have a traditional $β$-memory for collecting partial matches. Instead, CORGI takes a two-step approach: a graph of grounded relations is built/maintained in a forward pass, and an iterator generates matches as needed by working backward through the graph. This approach eliminates the high-latency delays and memory overflows that can result from populating full conflict sets. In a performance evaluation, we demonstrate that CORGI significantly outperforms RETE implementations from SOAR and OPS5 on a simple combinatorial matching task."}

These devices create phase-to-phase imbalances that manifest as voltage unbalance, a power quality issue that accelerates insulation aging in machines and increases network losses, thereby raising costs for operators and consumers. Traditional grid codes address unbalance via disparate hard limits on various indices thresholds that differ across standards, offer no dynamic economic incentive and undermine optimality. This paper proposes instead to treat voltage unbalance as a `soft limit' by adding penalty terms to grid operation costs within a three-phase optimal power flow to reflect the cost of the decrease in lifetime of assets due to being subject to voltage unbalance. This unified approach yields dynamic economic signals unbalance-aware Distribution Locational Marginal Prices (DLMP) that reflect the cost of power quality deviations. A novel mathematical decomposition of DLMP is developed, isolating the energy, loss, congestion, and unbalance components. Case studies conducted on two benchmark networks demonstrate the effectiveness and practical value of the proposed method. The results indicate that unbalance penalties reshape nodal prices, produce unexpected phase-level effects, and even allow scenarios where added load reduces unbalance and lowers costs, while providing planners and market designers with actionable insights to balance investment, operation, and power quality in modern distribution systems."}

We present STAR (SpatioTemporal Active Retrieval), a framework that unifies memory queries and embodied actions within a single decision loop. STAR leverages non-parametric long-term memory and a working memory to support efficient recall, and uses a vision-language model to select either temporal or spatial actions at each step. We introduce STARBench, a benchmark of spatiotemporal object search tasks across simulated and real environments. Experiments in STARBench and on a Tiago robot show that STAR consistently outperforms scene-graph and memory-only baselines, demonstrating the benefits of treating search in time and search in space as a unified problem."}

Researchers' Perspectives on AI in Manufacturing and Materials Science", "comment": null, "summary": "Artificial intelligence (AI) raises expectations of substantial increases in rates of technological and scientific progress, but such anticipations are often not connected to detailed ground-level studies of AI use in innovation processes. Accordingly, it remains unclear how and to what extent AI can accelerate innovation. To help to fill this gap, we report results from 32 interviews with U.S.-based academic manufacturing and materials sciences researchers experienced with AI and machine learning (ML) techniques. Interviewees primarily used AI for modeling of materials and manufacturing processes, facilitating cheaper and more rapid search of design spaces for materials and manufacturing processes alike. They report benefits including cost, time, and computation savings in technology development. However, interviewees also report that AI/ML tools are unreliable outside design spaces for which dense data are already available; that they require skilled and judicious application in tandem with older research techniques; and that AI/ML tools may detrimentally circumvent opportunities for disruptive theoretical advancement. Based on these results, we suggest there is reason for optimism about acceleration in sustaining innovations through the use of to AI/ML; but that support for conventional empirical, computational, and theoretical research is required to maintain the likelihood of further major advances in manufacturing and materials science."}

The core innovation of ALEX is its hierarchical memory architecture, which organizes knowledge updates (edits) into semantic clusters. This design fundamentally reduces retrieval complexity from a linear O(N) to a highly scalable O(K+N/C).

While the role of AI in such situations is gaining attention for making optimal decisions within limited resources and time, its development and performance evaluation require benchmark datasets of sufficient quantity and quality. However, MCIs occur infrequently, and sufficient records are difficult to accumulate at the scene, making it challenging to collect large-scale realworld data for research use. Therefore, we developed Syn-STARTS, a framework that uses LLMs to generate triage cases, and verified its effectiveness. The results showed that the triage cases generated by Syn-STARTS were qualitatively indistinguishable from the TRIAGE open dataset generated by manual curation from training materials. Furthermore, when evaluating the LLM accuracy using hundreds of cases each from the green, yellow, red, and black categories defined by the standard triage method START, the results were found to be highly stable. This strongly indicates the possibility of synthetic data in developing high-performance AI models for severe and critical medical situations."}

These applications usually involve navigating at high speeds through constrained spaces such as small gaps. Navigating such constrained spaces becomes particularly challenging when the space is crowded with multiple heterogeneous agents all of which have urgent priorities. What makes the problem even harder is that during an active response situation, roles and priorities can quickly change on a dime without informing the other agents. In order to complete missions in such environments, robots must not only be safe, but also agile, able to dodge and change course at a moment's notice. In this paper, we propose FACA, a fair and agile collision avoidance approach where robots coordinate their tasks by talking to each other via natural language (just as people do). In FACA, robots balance safety with agility via a novel artificial potential field algorithm that creates an automatic ``roundabout'' effect whenever a conflict arises. Our experiments show that FACA achieves a improvement in efficiency, completing missions more than 3.5X faster than baselines with a time reduction of over 70% while maintaining robust safety margins."}

Traditional navigation approaches rely on static Building Information Modeling (BIM) priors or limited onboard perception. In contrast, our framework continuously fuses real-time LiDAR data from aerial and ground robots with BIM priors to maintain an evolving 2D occupancy map. We quantify navigation safety through a unified corridor-risk metric integrating occupancy uncertainty, BIM-map discrepancy, and clearance. When risk exceeds safety thresholds, the UAV autonomously re-scans affected regions to reduce uncertainty and enable safe replanning. Validation in PX4-Gazebo simulation with Robotec GPU LiDAR demonstrates that risk-triggered re-scanning reduces mean corridor risk by 58% and map entropy by 43% compared to static BIM navigation, while maintaining clearance margins above 0.4 m. Compared to frontier-based exploration, our approach achieves similar uncertainty reduction in half the mission time. These results demonstrate that integrating BIM priors with risk-adaptive aerial sensing enables scalable, uncertainty-aware autonomy for construction robotics."}

This study presents evidence supporting an instructor-governed feedback loop that converts concept-level assessment evidence into vetted micro-interventions. The adaptive learning algorithm contains three safeguards: adequacy as a hard guarantee of gap closure, attention as a budgeted constraint for time and redundancy, and diversity as protection against overfitting to a single resource. We formalize intervention assignment as a binary integer program with constraints for coverage, time, difficulty windows informed by ability estimates, prerequisites encoded by a concept matrix, and anti-redundancy enforced through diversity. Greedy selection serves low-richness and tight-latency regimes, gradient-based relaxation serves rich repositories, and a hybrid method transitions along a richness-latency frontier. In simulation and in an introductory physics deployment with one thousand two hundred four students, both solvers achieved full skill coverage for essentially all learners within bounded watch time. The gradient-based method reduced redundant coverage by approximately twelve percentage points relative to greedy and harmonized difficulty across slates, while greedy delivered comparable adequacy with lower computational cost in scarce settings. Slack variables localized missing content and supported targeted curation, sustaining sufficiency across subgroups. The result is a tractable and auditable controller that closes the diagnostic-pedagogical loop and delivers equitable, load-aware personalization at classroom scale."}

This problem is interesting because LLMs often hallucinate when direct evidence to answer a question is lacking, and these effects become more pronounced in a network of interacting LLMs. The hallucination spreads, causing previously accurate LLMs to hallucinate. We study interacting LLMs and their hallucination by combining novel ideas of mean-field dynamics (MFD) from network science and the randomized utility model from economics to construct a useful generative model. We model the LLM with a latent state that indicates if it is truthful or not with respect to the ground truth, and extend a tractable analytical model considering an MFD to model the diffusion of information in a directed network of LLMs. To specify the probabilities that govern the dynamics of the MFD, we propose a randomized utility model. For a network of LLMs, where each LLM has two possible latent states, we posit sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of a fixed point and analyze the behavior of the fixed point in terms of the incentive (e.g., test-time compute) given to individual LLMs. We experimentally study and analyze the behavior of a network of $100$ open-source LLMs with respect to data heterogeneity, node capability, network structure, and sensitivity to framing on multiple semi-synthetic datasets."}

However, crafting satisfactory designs is time-intensive for designers: they need to consider which controls and content to present on the page, and then repeatedly adjust their size, position, and style for better aesthetics and structure. Although many design software can now help to perform these repetitive tasks, extensive training is needed to use them effectively. Moreover, collaborative design across app pages demands extra time to align standards and ensure consistent styling. In this work, we propose APD-agents, a large language model (LLM) driven multi-agent framework for automated page design in mobile applications. Our framework contains OrchestratorAgent, SemanticParserAgent, PrimaryLayoutAgent, TemplateRetrievalAgent, and RecursiveComponentAgent. Upon receiving the user's description of the page, the OrchestratorAgent can dynamically can direct other agents to accomplish users' design task. To be specific, the SemanticParserAgent is responsible for converting users' descriptions of page content into structured data. The PrimaryLayoutAgent can generate an initial coarse-grained layout of this page. The TemplateRetrievalAgent can fetch semantically relevant few-shot examples and enhance the quality of layout generation. Besides, a RecursiveComponentAgent can be used to decide how to recursively generate all the fine-grained sub-elements it contains for each element in the layout. Our work fully leverages the automatic collaboration capabilities of large-model-driven multi-agent systems.

Recent research underscores the potential of harnessing large language models (LLMs) for VLN, given their commonsense knowledge and general reasoning capabilities. Despite their strengths, a substantial gap in task completion performance persists between LLM-based approaches and domain experts, as LLMs inherently struggle to comprehend real-world spatial correlations precisely. Additionally, introducing LLMs is accompanied with substantial computational cost and inference latency. To address these issues, we propose a novel dual-process thinking framework dubbed R3, integrating LLMs' generalization capabilities with VLN-specific expertise in a zero-shot manner. The framework comprises three core modules: Runner, Ruminator, and Regulator. The Runner is a lightweight transformer-based expert model that ensures efficient and accurate navigation under regular circumstances. The Ruminator employs a powerful multimodal LLM as the backbone and adopts chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to elicit structured reasoning. The Regulator monitors the navigation progress and controls the appropriate thinking mode according to three criteria, integrating Runner and Ruminator harmoniously. Experimental results illustrate that R3 significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, exceeding 3.28% and 3.30% in SPL and RGSPL respectively on the REVERIE benchmark.

Electric grid operators, however, have limited knowledge of the reliability risks of data center interconnection due to their unique operational characteristics. An emerging concern is the sub-synchronous resonance (SSR) which refer to unexpected voltage/current oscillations at typical frequencies below 60/50 Hz. It remains unknown whether and how the interactions between data centers and the grid may trigger resonances, equipment damages, and even cascading failures. In this paper, we focus on grid-connected data centers that draw electricity from the grid through power factor correction (PFC) converters. We conduct two-tone frequency sweep to investigate the data centers' impedance characteristics, i.e. magnitude and phase angle variations over frequencies, and showcase their deep dependence on compute workloads. The impedance modeling provides a direct approach to evaluating SSR risks and enable a cooperative mechanism to alarm and avoid resonance-prone situations. Building upon the impedance, a data-driven preventive controller is then established to raise early warnings of risky operation and suggest flexible workload management according to the given grid conditions. Through case study, we demonstrate how to use impedance to understand the unexpected interactions. Data-driven impedance is validated to show decent performance in capturing the unique impedance dips and tracking the impedance variations across a range of workload scenarios. The early warning and preventive control approaches are further effective to improve the safety margins with minimal workload rescheduling. The key findings of this work will provide valuable insights for grid operators and data center managers, and support preparation for future scenarios involving large-scale data center integration."}

However, traditional VLA models that generate actions through flow matching (FM) typically rely on rigid and uniform time schedules, i.e., synchronous FM (SFM). Without action context awareness and asynchronous self-correction, SFM becomes unstable in long-horizon tasks, where a single action error can cascade into failure. In this work, we propose asynchronous flow matching VLA (AsyncVLA), a novel framework that introduces temporal flexibility in asynchronous FM (AFM) and enables self-correction in action generation. AsyncVLA breaks from the vanilla SFM in VLA models by generating the action tokens in a non-uniform time schedule with action context awareness. Besides, our method introduces the confidence rater to extract confidence of the initially generated actions, enabling the model to selectively refine inaccurate action tokens before execution. Moreover, we propose a unified training procedure for SFM and AFM that endows a single model with both modes, improving KV-cache utilization. Extensive experiments on robotic manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that AsyncVLA is data-efficient and exhibits self-correction ability.

However, these forecasts lack uncertainty awareness, making arbitrage strategies vulnerable to extreme price volatility. To address this, we propose simple heuristic uncertainty discounting methods, which require no access to the predictive model's architecture or inputs.

We test this fundamental question with a series of chronological ordering tasks with increasing complexities over facts the model already knows from pre-training. Our tasks cover (1) chronological ordering, (2) conditional sorting (filter, then order), and (3) anachronism detection. We evaluate GPT-4.1, Claude-3.7 Sonnet, with and without Extended Thinking (ET), and GPT-5 across multiple reasoning-effort settings. Across models, Exact match rate drops sharply as sequences lengthen even while rank correlations stay high as LLMs largely preserve local order but struggle to maintain a single globally consistent timeline. In conditional sorting, most failures stem from the filtering step rather than the ordering step, but GPT-5 and Claude-3.7 Sonnet with Extended Thinking outshine normal models significantly. Lastly, anachronism detection is found to be the easiest task for the LLMs but performance still declines with increasingly overlapping timelines or entities. Overall, our main contribution is showing that allocating explicit reasoning budget helps with chronological ordering with GPT-5 at medium/high reasoning effort achieving flawless ordering at all lengths and perfect conditional sorting (both self-filtered and given-subset), whereas low/minimal effort degrades with longer lists, mirroring earlier models. Our findings delineate limits of current LLMs on chronological tasks, providing insights into task complexity, and demonstrate scenarios in which reasoning helps. These patterns are important for the real-time application of LLMs in finance. We release all code and evaluation templates to support full reproducibility."}

However, it introduces significant voltage and current distortion when the number of submodules (SMs) per arm is small, as in medium-voltage applications. While indirect modulation offers fully decoupled control of ac-side current, dc-side current and SM capacitor energy, its performance is fundamentally reliant on accurate arm voltage synthesis, making it incompatible with the large quantization error inherent in NLM. To resolve this conflict, this paper proposes a new control strategy based on a disturbance observer (DOB). The key idea is to estimate and actively compensate for the inevitable arm voltage synthesis error induced by NLM, thereby enabling fully decoupled control of indirect-modulated MMC even under NLM operation with a small number of SMs. A key advantage is its ease of implementation, as it requires no modifications to the conventional NLM and decoupled control structure. The validity and effectiveness of the proposed method in improving current quality and decoupled SM energy control are verified through both simulation and experimental results."}

However, it frequently suffers from hallucination errors, especially under noisy acoustic conditions. Previous works to reduce hallucinations in Whisper-style ASR systems have primarily focused on audio preprocessing or post-processing of transcriptions to filter out erroneous content. However, modifications to the Whisper model itself remain largely unexplored to mitigate hallucinations directly. To address this challenge, we present a two-stage architecture that first enhances encoder robustness through Adaptive Layer Attention (ALA) and further suppresses hallucinations using a multi-objective knowledge distillation (KD) framework. In the first stage, ALA groups encoder layers into semantically coherent blocks via inter-layer correlation analysis. A learnable multi-head attention module then fuses these block representations, enabling the model to jointly exploit low- and high-level features for more robust encoding. In the second stage, our KD framework trains the student model on noisy audio to align its semantic and attention distributions with a teacher model processing clean inputs. Our experiments on noisy speech benchmarks show notable reductions in hallucinations and word error rates, while preserving performance on clean speech. Together, ALA and KD offer a principled strategy to improve Whisper's reliability under real-world noisy conditions."}

Accurately forecasting regional Airbnb market trends can thus offer critical insights for policymakers and urban planners aiming to mitigate these impacts. This study proposes a novel time-series forecasting framework to predict three key Airbnb indicators -- Revenue, Reservation Days, and Number of Reservations -- at the regional level. Using a sliding-window approach, the model forecasts trends 1 to 3 months ahead. Unlike prior studies that focus on individual listings at fixed time points, our approach constructs regional representations by integrating listing features with external contextual factors such as urban accessibility and human mobility. We convert structured tabular data into prompt-based inputs for a Large Language Model (LLM), producing comprehensive regional embeddings. These embeddings are then fed into advanced time-series models (RNN, LSTM, Transformer) to better capture complex spatio-temporal dynamics. Experiments on Seoul's Airbnb dataset show that our method reduces both average RMSE and MAE by approximately 48% compared to conventional baselines, including traditional statistical and machine learning models. Our framework not only improves forecasting accuracy but also offers practical insights for detecting oversupplied regions and supporting data-driven urban policy decisions."}

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in complex reasoning tasks. Despite promising success, current LLM-based KGR methods still face two critical limitations. First, existing methods often extract reasoning paths indiscriminately, without assessing their different importance, which may introduce irrelevant noise that misleads LLMs. Second, while many methods leverage LLMs to dynamically explore potential reasoning paths, they require high retrieval demands and frequent LLM calls. To address these limitations, we propose PathMind, a novel framework designed to enhance faithful and interpretable reasoning by selectively guiding LLMs with important reasoning paths. Specifically, PathMind follows a \"Retrieve-Prioritize-Reason\" paradigm. First, it retrieves a query subgraph from KG through the retrieval module. Next, it introduces a path prioritization mechanism that identifies important reasoning paths using a semantic-aware path priority function, which simultaneously considers the accumulative cost and the estimated future cost for reaching the target. Finally, PathMind generates accurate and logically consistent responses via a dual-phase training strategy, including task-specific instruction tuning and path-wise preference alignment. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that PathMind consistently outperforms competitive baselines, particularly on complex reasoning tasks with fewer input tokens, by identifying essential reasoning paths."}

In this work, we introduce spatial regret, a graph-informed metric that measures the worst-case performance gap between a distributed controller and an oracle which is assumed to have access to additional sensor information. The oracle's graph is a user-specified augmentation of the available information graph, resulting in a benchmark policy that highlights disturbances for which additional sensor information would significantly improve performance. Minimizing spatial regret yields distributed controllers-respecting the nominal information graph-that emulate the oracle's response to disturbances that are characteristic of large-scale networks, such as localized perturbations. We show that minimizing spatial regret admits a convex reformulation as an infinite program with a finite-dimensional approximation. To scale to large networks, we derive a computable upper bound on the spatial regret metric whose minimization problem can be solved in a distributed way. Numerical experiments on power-system models demonstrate that the resulting controllers mitigate localized disturbances more effectively than controllers optimized using classical metrics."}

Complementarily, data collected online can contribute to improving the feedback performance relative to the current system's conditions, but are unable to account for the overall -- possibly time-varying -- system operation.\n  With this in mind, we consider the problem of stabilizing a time-varying linear system, whose parameters are only known to lie within a bounded polytopic set. Taking a robust data-driven approach, we synthesize the control law by simultaneously leveraging two sets of historical state and input measures: an offline dataset -- which covers the extreme variations of the system parameters -- and an online dataset consisting of a rolling window of the latest state and input samples.\n  Our approach relies on the data informativity framework: we thus relax persistent excitation requirements (i.e., the collected samples need not be sufficient for system identification), while still allowing for the design of a stabilizing controller. The state feedback law is obtained from standard Lyapunov arguments, implemented via semi-definite optimization: this also yields an upper bound on the cost-to-go for the class of systems that are consistent with the online data, while guaranteeing a decreasing cost for all systems compatible with the offline data.

As these two topics are closely interrelated, finite modelling and soft tissue characterisation offer valuable insights into pressure distribution and shear stress induced by the cuff.

To address these challenges, we propose an edge-aware lightweight monocular SLAM system combining sparse keypoint-based pose estimation with dense edge reconstruction. Our method employs deep learning-based depth prediction and edge detection, followed by optimization to refine keypoints and edges for geometric consistency, without relying on global loop closure or heavy neural computations. We fuse inertial data with vision by using an extended Kalman filter to resolve scale ambiguity and improve accuracy. The system operates in real time on low-power platforms, as demonstrated on a DJI Tello drone with a monocular camera and inertial sensors. In addition, we demonstrate robust autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance in indoor corridors and on the TUM RGBD dataset. Our approach offers an effective, practical solution to real-time mapping and navigation in resource-constrained environments."}

This paper addresses this problem by replacing the conventional outer PI controllers that regulate DC-link and PCC voltages with an offset-free data-driven predictive controller. The developed algorithm leverages either pre-fault or fault-time data to construct input-output predictors, yielding offset-free control without the need for physics-based modelling. Simulation results show that pre-fault offset-free DPC doubles the critical equivalent grid impedance that can be handled and reduces the root mean squared error during faults by a factor of 40, while maintaining computation times comparable to conventional PI control. These findings demonstrate that the developed offset-free data predictive controller offers a simple, robust, and computationally efficient alternative to conventional control, significantly enhancing fault-ride-through capabilities of converters in weak grids."}

Overcoming compounding errors in sequential action decisions remains a central challenge to improving BC performance. Existing approaches mitigate compounding errors through data augmentation, expressive representation, or temporal abstraction. However, they suffer from physical discontinuities and semantic-physical misalignment, leading to inaccurate action cloning and intermittent execution. In this paper, we present Continuous vision-language-action Co-Learning with Semantic-Physical Alignment (CCoL), a novel BC framework that ensures temporally consistent execution and fine-grained semantic grounding. It generates robust and smooth action execution trajectories through continuous co-learning across vision, language, and proprioceptive inputs (e.g., robot internal states). Meanwhile, we anchor language semantics to visuomotor representations by a bidirectional cross-attention to learn contextual information for action generation, successfully overcoming the problem of semantic-physical misalignment. Extensive experiments show that CCoL achieves an average 8.0% relative improvement across three simulation suites, with up to 19.2% relative gain in human-demonstrated bimanual insertion tasks. Real-world tests on a 7-DoF robot further confirm CCoL's generalization under unseen and noisy object states."}

These opposing interface models create workload-dependent tradeoffs that are not captured by small-scale studies. This work presents a side-by-side, large-scale comparison of PIM and CXL-PIM using measurements from real PIM hardware and trace-driven CXL modeling.

However, traditional mutation operators are poorly suited to robotic programs, which involve message-based commands and interactions with the physical world. This paper explores the adaptation of mutation testing to IRS by defining domain-specific mutation operators that capture the semantics of robot actions and sensor readings. We propose a methodology for generating meaningful mutants at the level of high-level read and write operations, including movement, gripper actions, and sensor noise injection. An empirical study on a pick-and-place scenario demonstrates that our approach produces more informative mutants and reduces the number of invalid or equivalent cases compared to conventional operators.

We fine-tuned multiple Large Language Models and Large Reasoning Models using preferences from different social groups while varying rating scales, disagreement handling methods, and optimization techniques. The results revealed systematic demographic effects: male participants rated responses 18% less toxic than female participants; conservative and Black participants rated responses 27.9% and 44% more emotionally aware than liberal and White participants, respectively.

In this system, each HAP node can flexibly switch among energy source, load, and storage roles according to its energy status and mission requirements, enabling energy exchange and spatiotemporal optimization within the stratosphere. Through cooperative scheduling, the stratospheric grid not only enables surplus-to-deficit energy support among HAPs but also extends upward to satellites and downward to the terrestrial grid and communication infrastructure, forming a heterogeneous, WPT-mediated interconnection. As an IGGLS ecosystem, it exploits peer-to-peer energy logistics, spatiotemporal smoothing of intermittency, cross-domain backup via the terrestrial grid, and service-aware dispatch, thereby boosting overall energy utilization and operational resilience.

This happens because demonstrations show robots how to do a task but not what matters for that task, causing the model to focus on irrelevant state details. Natural language can more directly specify what the robot should focus on, and, in principle, disambiguate between many reward functions consistent with the demonstrations. However, existing language-conditioned reward learning methods typically treat instructions as simple conditioning signals, without fully exploiting their potential to resolve ambiguity. Moreover, real instructions are often ambiguous themselves, so naive conditioning is unreliable. Our key insight is that these two input types carry complementary information: demonstrations show how to act, while language specifies what is important. We propose Masked Inverse Reinforcement Learning (Masked IRL), a framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to combine the strengths of both input types. Masked IRL infers state-relevance masks from language instructions and enforces invariance to irrelevant state components. When instructions are ambiguous, it uses LLM reasoning to clarify them in the context of the demonstrations. In simulation and on a real robot, Masked IRL outperforms prior language-conditioned IRL methods by up to 15% while using up to 4.7 times less data, demonstrating improved sample-efficiency, generalization, and robustness to ambiguous language.

Using data from 1,343 students across 15 cohorts (2004-2019) in a public engineering faculty in Argentina, we construct a leak-aware, multilevel feature set that incorporates national inflation indicators, lagged exposure to teacher strikes, and interaction terms between macro shocks and curriculum friction. Random Forest models with cohort-based validation demonstrate that macro features provide stable, non-trivial gains in early-semester dropout prediction (improvement in Macro F1 from 0.73 to 0.78), with inflation volatility at entry and a strike-weighted basic-cycle friction index amongst the most influential variables. Lag analysis reveals that strike exposure exerts its strongest association with dropout two to three semesters after the disruption (OR = 2.34), and that effects are concentrated in early, high-friction semesters. We then embed these empirical patterns into an agent-based model, defining scenarios for inflation-only, strikes-only, and combined crisis. Simulations reproduce three stylised facts: delayed strike effects, basic-cycle vulnerability, and non-linear amplification when inflation and strikes co-occur, with combined shocks generating dropout levels 18-23% higher than the sum of individual effects. We argue that teacher strikes and inflation operate as structurally mediated educational disruptors, acting through curriculum design and financial resilience rather than as isolated events. The framework contributes to multilevel dropout theory by demonstrating how macro-level shocks propagate through institutional structures to shape individual trajectories and provides empirically grounded tools for scenario planning in macroeconomically unstable contexts."}

This issue arises from the lack of comprehensive benchmarks that assess both external environmental risks and in-cabin driving behavior safety simultaneously.

DSBench encompasses two major categories: external environmental risks and in-cabin driving behavior safety, divided into 10 key categories and a total of 28 sub-categories. This comprehensive evaluation covers a wide range of scenarios, ensuring a thorough assessment of VLMs' performance in safety-critical contexts. Extensive evaluations across various mainstream open-source and closed-source VLMs reveal significant performance degradation under complex safety-critical situations, highlighting urgent safety concerns.

However, existing perception modules, mainly based on depth images or elevation maps, offer only partial and locally flattened views of the environment, failing to capture the full 3D structure. This paper presents Gallant, a voxel-grid-based framework for humanoid locomotion and local navigation in 3D constrained terrains. It leverages voxelized LiDAR data as a lightweight and structured perceptual representation, and employs a z-grouped 2D CNN to map this representation to the control policy, enabling fully end-to-end optimization. A high-fidelity LiDAR simulation that dynamically generates realistic observations is developed to support scalable, LiDAR-based training and ensure sim-to-real consistency. Experimental results show that Gallant's broader perceptual coverage facilitates the use of a single policy that goes beyond the limitations of previous methods confined to ground-level obstacles, extending to lateral clutter, overhead constraints, multi-level structures, and narrow passages. Gallant also firstly achieves near 100% success rates in challenging scenarios such as stair climbing and stepping onto elevated platforms through improved end-to-end optimization."}

In this work, we propose AutoTool, a novel graph-based framework that bypasses repeated LLM inference by exploiting a key empirical observation: tool usage inertia - the tendency of tool invocations to follow predictable sequential patterns. AutoTool constructs a directed graph from historical agent trajectories, where nodes represent tools and edges capture transition probabilities, effectively modeling the inertia in tool selection. It further integrates parameter-level information to refine tool input generation. By traversing this structured representation, AutoTool efficiently selects tools and their parameters with minimal reliance on LLM inference. Extensive experiments across diverse agent tasks demonstrate that AutoTool reduces inference costs by up to 30% while maintaining competitive task completion rates, offering a practical and scalable enhancement for inference-heavy frameworks. Our work highlights the promise of integrating statistical structure into LLM agent design for greater efficiency without sacrificing performance."}

Our computationally efficient hybrid approach separates the prediction: (1) kernel ridge regression learns the nonlinear map from past trajectories, and (2) analytical linearization of the kernel map approximates the effect of future inputs. This linearization is key, allowing the controller to be formulated as a standard Quadratic Program (QP) for efficient real-time implementation. Offset-free tracking is inherently achieved by using input increments. We provide theoretical guarantees for recursive feasibility and asymptotic stability. The algorithm is validated on a nonlinear Van der Pol oscillator, where it successfully rejects unmeasured disturbances and eliminates steady-state errors, outperforming a standard model-based controller."}

In this work, we introduce NORA-1.5, a VLA model built from the pre-trained NORA backbone by adding to it a flow-matching-based action expert. This architectural enhancement alone yields substantial performance gains, enabling NORA-1.5 to outperform NORA and several state-of-the-art VLA models across both simulated and real-world benchmarks. To further improve robustness and task success, we develop a set of reward models for post-training VLA policies. Our rewards combine (i) an action-conditioned world model (WM) that evaluates whether generated actions lead toward the desired goal, and (ii) a deviation-from-ground-truth heuristic that distinguishes good actions from poor ones. Using these reward signals, we construct preference datasets and adapt NORA-1.5 to target embodiments through direct preference optimization (DPO). Extensive evaluations show that reward-driven post-training consistently improves performance in both simulation and real-robot settings, demonstrating significant VLA model-reliability gains through simple yet effective reward models. Our findings highlight NORA-1.5 and reward-guided post-training as a viable path toward more dependable embodied agents suitable for real-world deployment."}

Effective prompts should meet three principles: focus on decision-critical information, provide step-level granularity, and minimize reliance on expert annotations through label efficiency. However, existing ICL methods often fail to satisfy all three criteria simultaneously. Motivated by these challenges, we introduce SkillGen, a skill-based ICL framework for structured sequential reasoning. It constructs an action-centric, domain-level graph from sampled trajectories, identifies high-utility actions via temporal-difference credit assignment, and retrieves step-wise skills to generate fine-grained, context-aware prompts. We further present a theoretical analysis showing that focusing on high-utility segments supports task identifiability and informs more effective ICL prompt design. Experiments on ALFWorld, BabyAI, and ScienceWorld, using both open-source and proprietary LLMs, show that SkillGen achieves consistent gains, improving progress rate by 5.9%-16.5% on average across models."}

This survey presents the first comprehensive review dedicated specifically to the use of GNNs within Vehicular Social Networks (VSNs). By leveraging both Euclidean and non-Euclidean transportation-related data, including traffic patterns, road users, and weather conditions, GNNs offer promising solutions for analyzing and enhancing VSN applications. The survey systematically categorizes and analyzes existing studies according to major VSN-related tasks, including traffic flow and trajectory prediction, traffic forecasting, signal control, driving assistance, routing problem, and connectivity management. It further provides quantitative insights and synthesizes key takeaways derived from the literature review. Additionally, the survey examines the available datasets and outlines open research directions needed to advance GNN-based VSN applications. The findings indicate that, although GNNs demonstrate strong potential for improving the accuracy, robustness, and real-time performances of on task-specific or sub-VSN graphs, there remains a notable absence of studies that model a complete, standalone VSN encompassing all functional components. With the increasing availability of data and continued progress in graph learning, GNNs are expected to play a central role in enabling future large-scale and fully integrated VSN applications."}

This paper demonstrates how Large Language Models (LLMs) can dismantle these protective barriers by democratizing access to strategic expertise. Through empirical analysis of rent division scenarios on Spliddit algorithms, we show that users can obtain actionable manipulation strategies via simple conversational queries to AI assistants. We present four distinct manipulation scenarios: exclusionary collusion where majorities exploit minorities, defensive counterstrategies that backfire, benevolent subsidization of specific participants, and cost minimization coalitions. Our experiments reveal that LLMs can explain algorithmic mechanics, identify profitable deviations, and generate specific numerical inputs for coordinated preference misreporting--capabilities previously requiring deep technical knowledge. These findings extend algorithmic collective action theory from classification contexts to resource allocation scenarios, where coordinated preference manipulation replaces feature manipulation. The implications reach beyond rent division to any domain using algorithmic fairness mechanisms for resource division. While AI-enabled manipulation poses risks to system integrity, it also creates opportunities for preferential treatment of equity deserving groups. We argue that effective responses must combine algorithmic robustness, participatory design, and equitable access to AI capabilities, acknowledging that strategic sophistication is no longer a scarce resource."}

However, its lossless, reactive power-agnostic model often yields dispatches that are infeasible under practical operating scenarios such as the nonlinear AC power flow (ACPF) equations. While theoretical analysis demonstrates that DCOPF solutions are inherently AC-infeasible, their widespread industry adoption suggests substantial practical utility. This paper develops a unified DCOPF-ACPF pipeline to recover AC feasible solutions from DCOPF-based dispatches. The pipeline uses four DCOPF variants and applies AC feasibility recovery using both distributed slack allocation and PV/PQ switching. The main objective is to identify the most effective pipeline for restoring AC feasibility. Evaluation across over 10,000 dispatch scenarios on various test cases demonstrates that the structured ACPF model yields solutions that satisfy both the ACPF equations, and all engineering inequality constraints. In a 13,659 bus case, the mean absolute error and cost differences between DCOPF and ACOPF are reduced by 75% and 93%, respectively, compared to conventional single slack bus methods. Under extreme loading conditions, the pipeline reduces inequality constraint violations by a factor of 3 to 5."}

These challenges make conventional optimization and value-based RL approaches computationally inefficient and difficult to scale. This paper applies a Heterogeneous-Agent Reinforcement Learning (HARL) framework, instantiated through Heterogeneous-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (HAPPO), to enable coordinated restoration across interconnected microgrids. Each agent controls a distinct microgrid with different loads, DER capacities, and switch counts, introducing practical structural heterogeneity. Decentralized actor policies are trained with a centralized critic to compute advantage values for stable on-policy updates. A physics-informed OpenDSS environment provides full power flow feedback and enforces operational limits via differentiable penalty signals rather than invalid action masking. The total DER generation is capped at 2400 kW, and each microgrid must satisfy local supply-demand feasibility. Experiments on the IEEE 123-bus and IEEE 8500-node systems show that HAPPO achieves faster convergence, higher restored power, and smoother multi-seed training than DQN, PPO, MAES, MAGDPG, MADQN, Mean-Field RL, and QMIX. Results demonstrate that incorporating microgrid-level heterogeneity within the HARL framework yields a scalable, stable, and constraint-aware solution for complex PDS restoration."}

Unfortunately, the verification of such systems remains challenging, largely due to the complexity of the controllers, which are often nonlinear, nonconvex, learning-based, and/or black-box. Prior works propose verification algorithms that are based on approximate reachability methods, but they often restrict the class of controllers and systems that can be handled or result in overly conservative analyses. Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis is a popular formal verification tool for general nonlinear systems that can compute optimal reachable sets under worst-case system uncertainties; however, its application to perception-based systems is currently underexplored. In this work, we propose RoVer-CoRe, a framework for the Robust Verification of Controllers via HJ Reachability. To the best of our knowledge, RoVer-CoRe is the first HJ reachability-based framework for the verification of perception-based systems under perceptual uncertainty. Our key insight is to concatenate the system controller, observation function, and the state estimation modules to obtain an equivalent closed-loop system that is readily compatible with existing reachability frameworks. Within RoVer-CoRe, we propose novel methods for formal safety verification and robust controller design. We demonstrate the efficacy of the framework in case studies involving aircraft taxiing and NN-based rover navigation. Code is available at the link in the footnote."}

To address this, we propose a Heterogeneous Meta-Control (HMC) framework for Loco-Manipulation that adaptively stitches multiple control modalities: position, impedance, and hybrid force-position. We first introduce an interface, HMC-Controller, for blending actions from different control profiles continuously in the torque space. HMC-Controller facilitates both teleoperation and policy deployment. Then, to learn a robust force-aware policy, we propose HMC-Policy to unify different controllers into a heterogeneous architecture. We adopt a mixture-of-experts style routing to learn from large-scale position-only data and fine-grained force-aware demonstrations. Experiments on a real humanoid robot show over 50% relative improvement vs. baselines on challenging tasks such as compliant table wiping and drawer opening, demonstrating the efficacy of HMC."}
