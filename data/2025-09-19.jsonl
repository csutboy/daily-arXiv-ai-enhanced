In particular, we design nonlinear stabilizers for both linear and\nnonlinear abstract systems. We focus on two classes of systems: the first class\ncomprises linear abstract systems subject to matched perturbations, while the\nsecond class encompasses fully nonlinear abstract systems. Our main objective\nis to synthesize state-feedback controllers that guarantee finite- or\nfixed-time stability of the closed-loop system, along with possible estimation\nof the settling time. For the first class, the presence of persistent\nperturbations introduces significant challenges in the well-posedness analysis,\nparticularly due to the discontinuous nature of the control law. To address\nthis, we employ maximal monotone operator theory to rigorously establish the\nexistence and uniqueness of solutions, extending classical results from\ncontinuous abstract systems. For the second class, which includes\nnonlinearities, we further show that the proposed feedback law ensures\nfixed-time stability and well-posedness of the closed-loop system, again using\nmaximal monotone theory. The results provide a unified framework for robust,\nfinite /fixed-time stabilization in the presence of discontinuities and\nnonlinearities in infinite-dimensional settings."}

In such cases,\nthe optimal effort may occur at a kink point that the first-order condition\ncannot capture, causing FOA to miss optimal contracts, including widely adopted\nbonus schemes. Motivated by this limitation, we introduce the Implementation\nRelaxation Approach (IRA), which relaxes the set of agent actions and payoffs\nthat feasible contracts can induce, rather than directly relaxing IC. IRA\naccommodates non-differentiable optima and is straightforward to apply across\nsettings, particularly for deriving optimality conditions for simple contracts.\nUsing IRA, we derive an optimality condition for quota-bonus contracts that is\nmore general, encompassing a broader range of scenarios than FOA-based\nconditions, including those established in the literature under fixed-support\nassumptions.

We argue that current\nperformance-based definitions are inadequate because they provide no clear,\nmechanism-focused roadmap for research, and they fail to properly define the\nqualitative nature of genuine intelligence. Drawing inspiration from the human\nbrain, we propose a new paradigm that shifts the focus from external mimicry to\nthe development of foundational cognitive architectures. We define True\nIntelligence (TI) as a system characterized by six core components: embodied\nsensory fusion, core directives, dynamic schemata creation, a\nhighly-interconnected multi-expert architecture, an orchestration layer, and\nlastly, the unmeasurable quality of Interconnectedness, which we hypothesize\nresults in consciousness and a subjective experience. We propose a practical,\nfive-level taxonomy of AGI based on the number of the first five measurable\ncomponents a system exhibits. This framework provides a clear path forward with\ndevelopmental milestones that directly address the challenge of building\ngenuinely intelligent systems. We contend that once a system achieves Level-5\nAGI by implementing all five measurable components, the difference between it\nand TI remains as a purely philosophical debate. For practical purposes - and\ngiven theories indicate consciousness is an emergent byproduct of integrated,\nhigher-order cognition - we conclude that a fifth-level AGI is functionally and\npractically equivalent to TI.

While game-theoretic properties can explain why certain teams or agent\npopulations outperform others, more abstract behaviours, such as convention\nfollowing, are harder to control in training and evaluation settings. The\nMelting Pot contest is a social AI evaluation suite designed to assess the\ncooperation capabilities of AI systems. In this paper, we apply a Bayesian\napproach known as Measurement Layouts to infer the capability profiles of\nmulti-agent systems in the Melting Pot contest. We show that these capability\nprofiles not only predict future performance within the Melting Pot suite but\nalso reveal the underlying prosocial abilities of agents. Our analysis\nindicates that while higher prosocial capabilities sometimes correlate with\nbetter performance, this is not a universal trend-some lower-scoring agents\nexhibit stronger cooperation abilities. Furthermore, we find that\ntop-performing contest submissions are more likely to achieve high scores in\nscenarios where prosocial capabilities are not required.

The system\ncombines lightweight visual perception with large language model (LLM)\nreasoning: hand poses are converted into structured textual descriptions, which\nthe LLM uses to infer intent and generate robot-specific commands. A robot\nselection module ensures that each gesture-triggered task is matched to the\nmost suitable agent in real time. This architecture enables context-aware,\nadaptive control without requiring explicit user specification of targets or\ncommands. By advancing gesture interaction from recognition to intelligent\norchestration, GestOS supports scalable, flexible, and user-friendly\ncollaboration with robotic systems in dynamic environments."}

With human-like\ncapabilities, LLMs have been used to simulate humans and serve as AI assistants\nacross many applications. As a result, great concern has arisen about whether\nand under what circumstances LLMs think and behave like real human agents.\nRationality is among the most important concepts in assessing human behavior,\nboth in thinking (i.e., theoretical rationality) and in taking action (i.e.,\npractical rationality). In this work, we propose the first benchmark for\nevaluating the omnibus rationality of LLMs, covering a wide range of domains\nand LLMs. The benchmark includes an easy-to-use toolkit, extensive experimental\nresults, and analysis that illuminates where LLMs converge and diverge from\nidealized human rationality. We believe the benchmark can serve as a\nfoundational tool for both developers and users of LLMs."}

We argue that current\nperformance-based definitions are inadequate because they provide no clear,\nmechanism-focused roadmap for research, and they fail to properly define the\nqualitative nature of genuine intelligence. Drawing inspiration from the human\nbrain, we propose a new paradigm that shifts the focus from external mimicry to\nthe development of foundational cognitive architectures. We define True\nIntelligence (TI) as a system characterized by six core components: embodied\nsensory fusion, core directives, dynamic schemata creation, a\nhighly-interconnected multi-expert architecture, an orchestration layer, and\nlastly, the unmeasurable quality of Interconnectedness, which we hypothesize\nresults in consciousness and a subjective experience. We propose a practical,\nfive-level taxonomy of AGI based on the number of the first five measurable\ncomponents a system exhibits. This framework provides a clear path forward with\ndevelopmental milestones that directly address the challenge of building\ngenuinely intelligent systems. We contend that once a system achieves Level-5\nAGI by implementing all five measurable components, the difference between it\nand TI remains as a purely philosophical debate. For practical purposes - and\ngiven theories indicate consciousness is an emergent byproduct of integrated,\nhigher-order cognition - we conclude that a fifth-level AGI is functionally and\npractically equivalent to TI. This work synthesizes diverse insights from\nanalytical psychology, schema theory, metacognition, modern brain architectures\nand latest works in AI to provide the first holistic, mechanism-based\ndefinition of AGI that offers a clear and actionable path for the research\ncommunity."}

We\nvalidate the method on a large synthetic scene with approximately 170k splats,\nwhere our filter reduces planning time by a factor of 3 and significantly\ndecreased trajectory jerk compared to a state-of-the-art 3DGS planner, while\nmaintaining the same level of safety.

We study the problem of deception, where an agent pursues a\nprivate objective while remaining plausibly compliant with a supervisor's\nreference policy when observations occur. Motivated by the behavior of real,\nhuman supervisors, we situate the problem within Theory of Mind: the\nrepresentation of what an observer believes and expects to see.

Such agents can potentially oversee\ninter-agent communications, identify potential threats, enforce privacy and\naccess controls, and maintain comprehensive audit records. Complementary to the\nidea of Sentinel Agents is the use of a Coordinator Agent. The Coordinator\nAgent supervises policy implementation, and manages agent participation.

Drawing inspiration from the human\nbrain, we propose a new paradigm that shifts the focus from external mimicry to\nthe development of foundational cognitive architectures.

Conventional approaches, such as\ntrajectory tracking, demand a dynamically feasible, full-state reference,\nwhereas contouring control relaxes this requirement to a geometric path but\nstill necessitates a reference. Recent advancements in reinforcement learning\n(RL) have revealed that many model-based controllers optimize surrogate\nobjectives, such as trajectory tracking, rather than the primary racing goal of\ndirectly maximizing progress through gates. Inspired by these findings, this\nwork introduces a reference-free method for time-optimal racing by\nincorporating this gate progress objective, derived from RL reward shaping,\ndirectly into the Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) formulation. The\nsampling-based nature of MPPI makes it uniquely capable of optimizing the\ndiscontinuous and non-differentiable objective in real-time. We also establish\na unified framework that leverages MPPI to systematically and fairly compare\nthree distinct objective functions with a consistent dynamics model and\nparameter set: classical trajectory tracking, contouring control, and the\nproposed gate progress objective. We compare the performance of these three\nobjectives when solved via both MPPI and a traditional gradient-based solver.\nOur results demonstrate that the proposed reference-free approach achieves\ncompetitive racing performance, rivaling or exceeding reference-based methods.\nVideos are available at https://zhaofangguo.github.io/racing_mppi/"}

While large-scale proximal policy\noptimisation (PPO) has enabled impressive results such as robust robot\nlocomotion in the real world, many tasks still require careful reward tuning\nand are brittle to local optima. Tuning cost and sub-optimality grow with the\nnumber of objectives, limiting scalability. Modelling reward vectors and their\ntrade-offs can address these issues; however, multi-objective methods remain\nunderused in RL for robotics because of computational cost and optimisation\ndifficulty. In this work, we investigate the conflict between gradient\ncontributions for each objective that emerge from scalarising the task\nobjectives. In particular, we explicitly address the conflict between\ntask-based rewards and terms that regularise the policy towards realistic\nbehaviour. We propose GCR-PPO, a modification to actor-critic optimisation that\ndecomposes the actor update into objective-wise gradients using a multi-headed\ncritic and resolves conflicts based on the objective priority. Our methodology,\nGCR-PPO, is evaluated on the well-known IsaacLab manipulation and locomotion\nbenchmarks and additional multi-objective modifications on two related tasks.\nWe show superior scalability compared to parallel PPO (p = 0.04), without\nsignificant computational overhead. We also show higher performance with more\nconflicting tasks. GCR-PPO improves on large-scale PPO with an average\nimprovement of 9.5%, with high-conflict tasks observing a greater improvement.\nThe code is available at https://github.com/humphreymunn/GCR-PPO."}

Recently, the Model Predictive Path\nIntegral (MPPI) method has emerged as a promising solution that solves the\nfirst two challenges. By leveraging sampling-based optimization, it can\neffectively handle non-convex free space while directly optimizing over the\nfull quadrotor dynamics, enabling the inclusion of quadrotor-specific costs\nsuch as energy consumption.

To solve this issue, we introduce Perception-Aware MPPI\n(PA-MPPI). Here, perception-awareness is defined as adapting the trajectory\nonline based on perception objectives. Specifically, when the goal is occluded,\nPA-MPPI's perception cost biases trajectories that can perceive unknown\nregions.

We evaluate 38 frontier models and 126 adults on 120 riddles. No\nmodel except for GPT-5 is comparable to human performance, which achieves a\n52.9% mean accuracy. Model comparison on extended 201 items shows that\nreasoning models significantly outperform non-reasoning peers, while model size\nshows no reliable association with accuracy. Beyond aggregate accuracy, an\ninformal candidate-tracking analysis of thought logs reveals many cases of\nverification failure: models often produce the correct solution among\nintermediate candidates yet fail to select it as the final answer, which we\nillustrate with representative examples observed in multiple models. Nazonazo\nthus offers a cost-effective, scalable, and easily renewable benchmark format\nthat addresses the current evaluation crisis while also suggesting a recurrent\nmeta-cognitive weakness, providing clear targets for future control and\ncalibration methods."}

Conventional approaches, such as\ntrajectory tracking, demand a dynamically feasible, full-state reference,\nwhereas contouring control relaxes this requirement to a geometric path but\nstill necessitates a reference. Recent advancements in reinforcement learning\n(RL) have revealed that many model-based controllers optimize surrogate\nobjectives, such as trajectory tracking, rather than the primary racing goal of\ndirectly maximizing progress through gates. Inspired by these findings, this\nwork introduces a reference-free method for time-optimal racing by\nincorporating this gate progress objective, derived from RL reward shaping,\ndirectly into the Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) formulation. The\nsampling-based nature of MPPI makes it uniquely capable of optimizing the\ndiscontinuous and non-differentiable objective in real-time.

In this paper, we\nintroduce a Multi-robot Connectivity-Aware Planner (Multi-CAP), a hierarchical\ncoverage path planning algorithm that facilitates multi-robot coordination\nthrough a novel connectivity-aware approach. The algorithm constructs and\ndynamically maintains an adjacency graph that represents the environment as a\nset of connected subareas. Critically, we make the assumption that the\nenvironment, while unknown, is bounded. This allows for incremental refinement\nof the adjacency graph online to ensure its structure represents the physical\nlayout of the space, both in observed and unobserved areas of the map as robots\nexplore the environment. We frame the task of assigning subareas to robots as a\nVehicle Routing Problem (VRP), a well-studied problem for finding optimal\nroutes for a fleet of vehicles. This is used to compute disjoint tours that\nminimize redundant travel, assigning each robot a unique, non-conflicting set\nof subareas. Each robot then executes its assigned tour, independently adapting\nits coverage strategy within each subarea to minimize path length based on\nreal-time sensor observations of the subarea.

A central component of\nthis framework is a network of Sentinel Agents, functioning as a distributed\nsecurity layer that integrates techniques such as semantic analysis via large\nlanguage models (LLMs), behavioral analytics, retrieval-augmented verification,\nand cross-agent anomaly detection. Such agents can potentially oversee\ninter-agent communications, identify potential threats, enforce privacy and\naccess controls, and maintain comprehensive audit records. Complementary to the\nidea of Sentinel Agents is the use of a Coordinator Agent. The Coordinator\nAgent supervises policy implementation, and manages agent participation. In\naddition, the Coordinator also ingests alerts from Sentinel Agents. Based on\nthese alerts, it can adapt policies, isolate or quarantine misbehaving agents,\nand contain threats to maintain the integrity of the MAS ecosystem. This\ndual-layered security approach, combining the continuous monitoring of Sentinel\nAgents with the governance functions of Coordinator Agents, supports dynamic\nand adaptive defense mechanisms against a range of threats, including prompt\ninjection, collusive agent behavior, hallucinations generated by LLMs, privacy\nbreaches, and coordinated multi-agent attacks.

Solving it requires addressing three key\nchallenges: the non-convexity of free space due to obstacles,\nquadrotor-specific dynamics and objectives, and the need for exploration of\nunknown regions to find a path to the goal. Recently, the Model Predictive Path\nIntegral (MPPI) method has emerged as a promising solution that solves the\nfirst two challenges. By leveraging sampling-based optimization, it can\neffectively handle non-convex free space while directly optimizing over the\nfull quadrotor dynamics, enabling the inclusion of quadrotor-specific costs\nsuch as energy consumption. However, its performance in unknown environments is\nlimited, as it lacks the ability to explore unknown regions when blocked by\nlarge obstacles. To solve this issue, we introduce Perception-Aware MPPI\n(PA-MPPI). Here, perception-awareness is defined as adapting the trajectory\nonline based on perception objectives. Specifically, when the goal is occluded,\nPA-MPPI's perception cost biases trajectories that can perceive unknown\nregions. This expands the mapped traversable space and increases the likelihood\nof finding alternative paths to the goal. Through hardware experiments, we\ndemonstrate that PA-MPPI, running at 50 Hz with our efficient perception and\nmapping module, performs up to 100% better than the baseline in our challenging\nsettings where the state-of-the-art MPPI fails.

However, most current VLA-based embodied agents operate in a one-way\nmode: they receive an instruction and execute it without feedback. This\napproach fails in real-world scenarios where instructions are often ambiguous.\nIn this paper, we address this problem with the Ask-to-Clarify framework. Our\nframework first resolves ambiguous instructions by asking questions in a\nmulti-turn dialogue. Then it generates low-level actions end-to-end.\nSpecifically, the Ask-to-Clarify framework consists of two components, one VLM\nfor collaboration and one diffusion for action.

While\nenergy-aware planning has been studied for aerial and underwater robots under\nbattery limits, few works for ground rovers explicitly model power flow or\nenforce instantaneous power constraints. Classical terrain-aware planners\nemphasize slope or traversability, and trajectory optimization methods\ntypically focus on geometric smoothness and dynamic feasibility, neglecting\nenergy feasibility. We present an energy-constrained trajectory planning\nframework that explicitly integrates physics-based models of translational,\nrotational, and resistive power with baseline subsystem loads, under hybrid\nRTG-solar input. By incorporating both cumulative energy budgets and\ninstantaneous power constraints into SE(2)-based polynomial trajectory\noptimization, the method ensures trajectories that are simultaneously smooth,\ndynamically feasible, and power-compliant.

A difficulty may arise for the case when a constraint has the relative\ndegree larger than 1, at which computing a proper CLBF is not straightforward.\nInstead of adding an (possibly non-existent) control barrier function (CBF) to\na control Lyapunov function (CLF), our key idea is to simply scale the value of\nthe CLF on the unsafe set, by utilizing a sigmoid function as a scaling factor.\nWe provide a systematic design method for the CLBF, with a detailed condition\nfor the parameters of the sigmoid function to satisfy. It is also seen that the\nproposed approach to the CLBF design can be applied to the problem of\ntask-space control for a planar robot manipulator with guaranteed safety, for\nwhich a safe feedback linearization-based controller is presented."}
