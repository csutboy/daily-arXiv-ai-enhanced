Here, we address this challenge by\ndeveloping a causal modeling framework that (i) simulates the possible network\npathways that emerge as contagions spread and (ii) identifies which edges and\nnodes are most impactful on diffusion across these possible pathways. This\nyields a surprising discovery. If people require exposure to multiple peers to\nadopt a contagion (a.k.a., 'complex contagions'), the pathways that emerge\noften only work in one direction. In fact, the more complex a contagion is, the\nmore asymmetric its paths become. This emergent directedness problematizes\ncanonical theories of how networks mediate contagion. Weak ties spanning\nnetwork regions - widely thought to facilitate mutual influence and integration\n- prove to privilege the spread contagions from one community to the other.\nEmergent directedness also disproportionately channels complex contagions from\nthe network periphery to the core, inverting standard centrality models. We\ndemonstrate two practical applications. We show that emergent directedness\naccounts for unexplained nonlinearity in the effects of tie strength in a\nrecent study of job diffusion over LinkedIn.

We argue that while we cannot be\nprescriptive about what constitutes fair outcomes, we can specify the processes\nthat different stakeholders should follow in service of fairness. Specifically,\nwe consider the obligations of two major groups: system providers and system\ndeployers. While system providers are natural candidates for regulatory\nattention, the current state of AI understanding offers limited insight into\nhow upstream factors translate into downstream fairness impacts. Thus, we\nrecommend that providers invest in evaluative research studying how model\ndevelopment decisions influence fairness and disclose whom they are serving\ntheir models to, or at the very least, reveal sufficient information for\nexternal researchers to conduct such research. On the other hand, system\ndeployers are closer to real-world contexts and can leverage their proximity to\nend users to address fairness harms in different ways. Here, we argue they\nshould responsibly disclose information about users and personalization and\nconduct rigorous evaluations across different levels of fairness.

Such results raise a crucial question for both capability\nand safety forecasting: how can one accurately predict a model's behavior when\nscaled to a massive number of attempts, given a vastly smaller sampling budget?\nThis question is directly relevant to model providers, who serve hundreds of\nmillions of users daily, and to governmental regulators, who seek to prevent\nharms. To answer this questions, we make three contributions. First, we find\nthat standard methods for fitting these laws suffer from statistical\nshortcomings that hinder predictive accuracy, especially in data-limited\nscenarios.

Existing control approaches lack\nformal guarantees for safety constraint satisfaction, necessary to ensure the\nsafe execution of the maneuvers. This paper introduces a control that addresses\nthis limitation by integrating trajectory tracking, disturbance estimation, and\nsafety enforcement. An extended high-gain observer is employed to estimate\ndisturbances resulting from gravitational model uncertainties. We then apply a\nfeedback-linearizing and disturbance-canceling controller that achieves\nexponential tracking of reference trajectories. Finally, we use a control\nbarrier function based minimum-intervention controller to enforce state and\ninput constraints through out the maneuver execution. This control combines\ntrajectory tracking of offline generated reference trajectories with formal\nguarantees of safety, which follows common guidance and control architectures\nfor spacecraft and allows aggressive maneuvers to be executed without\ncompromising safety. Numerical simulations using fuel-optimal trajectories\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the controller in achieving precise and safe\nsoft-landing, highlighting its potential for autonomous SCB missions."}

To address these issues, we\npropose Oracle-Guided Masked Contrastive Reinforcement Learning (OMC-RL), a\nnovel framework designed to improve the sample efficiency and asymptotic\nperformance of visuomotor policy learning. OMC-RL explicitly decouples the\nlearning process into two stages: an upstream representation learning stage and\na downstream policy learning stage. In the upstream stage, a masked Transformer\nmodule is trained with temporal modeling and contrastive learning to extract\ntemporally-aware and task-relevant representations from sequential visual\ninputs. After training, the learned encoder is frozen and used to extract\nvisual representations from consecutive frames, while the Transformer module is\ndiscarded. In the downstream stage, an oracle teacher policy with privileged\naccess to global state information supervises the agent during early training\nto provide informative guidance and accelerate early policy learning. This\nguidance is gradually reduced to allow independent exploration as training\nprogresses.

Here, we argue they\nshould responsibly disclose information about users and personalization and\nconduct rigorous evaluations across different levels of fairness. Overall,\ninstead of focusing on enforcing fairness outcomes, we prioritize intentional\ninformation-gathering by system providers and deployers that can facilitate\nlater context-aware action. This allows us to be specific and concrete about\nthe processes even while the contexts remain unknown. Ultimately, this approach\ncan sharpen how we distribute fairness responsibilities and inform more fluid,\ncontext-sensitive interventions as AI continues to advance."}

Second, a discrete elastic rod model predicts the\nrelationship between actuation parameters and flower dynamics, guiding the\nselection of optimal pollination strategies. Finally, a manipulator with soft\ngrippers grasps the stem and applies controlled vibrations to induce pollen\nrelease. End-to-end experiments demonstrate a 92.5\\% main-stem grasping success\nrate, and simulation-guided optimization of vibration parameters further\nvalidates the feasibility of our approach, ensuring that the robot can safely\nand effectively perform pollination without damaging the flower. To our\nknowledge, this is the first robotic system to jointly integrate vision-based\ngrasping and vibration modeling for automated precision pollination."}

Deterministic collision checks of planned trajectories are often\ninaccurate or overly conservative, as noisy perception, localization errors,\nand uncertain predictions of other traffic participants introduce significant\nuncertainty into the planning process. This paper presents two semi-analytic\nmethods to compute the collision probability of planned trajectories with\narbitrary convex obstacles.
