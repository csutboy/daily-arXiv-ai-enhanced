We develop the Effective Trade Model (ETM),\nwhere transactions arise from bilateral feasibility rather than aggregate\nsupply and demand desires. Within this framework, we establish the main\nproperties of the price-demand correspondence and prove the existence of Nash\nequilibria, incorporating production, money, and network topology. The analysis\nextends to time, uncertainty, and open economies, revealing how loanable funds\nand exchange rates emerge endogenously. Our results show that equilibrium is\nshaped by transaction constraints, subjective pricing, and decentralized\nnegotiation, rather than by universal market-clearing conditions, and thereby\ncall into question the foundations of welfare theory. Anticipation is modeled\nvia the conditional mode, capturing bounded rationality and information\nlimitations in contrast to the rational expectations hypothesis. The ETM thus\noffers a behaviorally and structurally grounded alternative to classical\ngeneral equilibrium, bridging microfoundations, monetary dynamics, and temporal\nconsistency within a unified framework."}

Building on Strulovici (2008), which assumes the agents' payoffs\nare independent, we explore the case in which the agents' payoffs are\ncorrelated. During experimentation, each agent learns individually whether she\nbenefits from $R$; in this way, she also gains information about its overall\ndesirability. Furthermore, each agent is able to learn indirectly from the\nothers, because in making her decisions, she conditions on being pivotal (i.e.,\nshe assumes her vote will determine the collective outcome). We show that, when\nthe number of agents is large, increasing the threshold $k$ for implementing\n$R$ leads to increased experimentation.

Such interactions between users and an\nalgorithm often unfold over multiple steps, during which strategic users can\nguide the algorithm to better align with their true interests by selectively\nengaging with content. However, users frequently exhibit inconsistent\npreferences: they may spend considerable time on content that offers little\nlong-term value, inadvertently signaling that such content is desirable.\nFocusing on the user side, this raises a key question: what does it take for\nsuch users to align the algorithm with their true interests?\n  To investigate these dynamics, we model the user's decision process as split\nbetween a rational system 2 that decides whether to engage and an impulsive\nsystem 1 that determines how long engagement lasts. We then study a\nmulti-leader, single-follower extensive Stackelberg game, where users,\nspecifically system 2, lead by committing to engagement strategies and the\nalgorithm best-responds based on observed interactions. We define the burden of\nalignment as the minimum horizon over which users must optimize to effectively\nsteer the algorithm. We show that a critical horizon exists: users who are\nsufficiently foresighted can achieve alignment, while those who are not are\ninstead aligned to the algorithm's objective. This critical horizon can be\nlong, imposing a substantial burden. However, even a small, costly signal\n(e.g., an extra click) can significantly reduce it. Overall, our framework\nexplains how users with inconsistent preferences can align an engagement-driven\nalgorithm with their interests in a Stackelberg equilibrium, highlighting both\nthe challenges and potential remedies for achieving alignment."}

This demands integrated models that jointly\ncapture disease dynamics, vaccine distribution, regional disparities, and\nbehavioral responses. However, most existing approaches decouple epidemic\nforecasting from logistics planning, hindering adaptive and regionally\nresponsive interventions. We propose a novel epidemiological-optimization\nframework that jointly models epidemic progression and a multiscale vaccine\nsupply chain. The model incorporates spatio-temporally varying effective\ninfection rates to reflect regional policy and behavioral dynamics. It supports\ncoordinated, data-driven decision-making across spatial scales through two\nformulations: a multi-objective Gini-based model and a knapsack-based model\nthat leverages regional vulnerability indicators for tractability and improved\nmitigation. To address computational complexity, we design two scalable\nheuristic decomposition algorithms inspired by the Benders decomposition. The\nmodel is validated using COVID-19 data in the U.S.. We introduce SARIMA-based\nforecasting as a novel approach for validating epidemic-optimization models\nunder data limitations. The results show that our approach can prevent more\nthan 2 million infections and 30,000 deaths in just six months while\nsignificantly improving the accessibility of vaccines in underserved regions.\nOur framework demonstrates that integrating fairness and epidemic dynamics with\nvaccine logistics leads to superior outcomes compared to traditional myopic\npolicies.

To accurately capture trends in cause-specific mortality,\nit is critical to consider dependencies between causes of death and produce\nforecasts by age and cause coherent with aggregate mortality forecasts. One way\nto achieve these aims is to model cause-specific deaths using compositional\ndata analysis (CODA), treating the density of deaths by age and cause as a set\nof dependent, non-negative values that sum to one. A major drawback of standard\nCODA methods is the challenge of zero values, which frequently occur in\ncause-of-death mortality modelling. Thus, we propose using a compositional\npower transformation, the $\\alpha$-transformation, to model cause-specific\nlife-table death counts. The $\\alpha$-transformation offers a statistically\nrigorous approach to handling zero value subgroups in CODA compared to\n\\emph{ad-hoc} techniques: adding an arbitrarily small amount.

Utilizing rich French administrative panel\ndata (2012-2019), this study has two main contributions: first, it presents a\nset of new, intuitive yet previously undocumented stylized facts about wage\ndynamics, sectoral mobility, and gender differences across sectors. The results\nreveal that the modest hourly wage gaps conceal substantial disparities in\nlifetime earnings and employment stability. Women, in particular, gain a\nsignificant lifetime earnings advantage in the public sector, driven by higher\nretention, better-compensated part-time work, and more equitable annual hours\ncompared to the private sector, where gender gaps remain larger, especially for\nthose with higher education. In contrast, highly educated men experience a\nlifetime penalty in public employment due to rigid wage structures. By flexibly\nmodeling sectoral transitions, transitions into and out of employment, and\nearnings heterogeneity using an Expectation-Maximization algorithm, this study\nshows that both premiums and penalties depend systematically on gender,\neducation, and labor market experience.

These\nstrategies can be enhanced for a group of structures, especially when they are\nsimilar, since mutual underlying physics are expected to exist. The concept\nbehind population-based SHM exploits the sharing of data among individuals, so\nthat data-rich members can support data-scarce ones. One approach to\npopulation-level modeling is the hierarchical Bayesian method, where the model\nis structured hierarchically in terms of its parameters, and correlation among\nlearning tasks is enabled by conditioning on shared latent variables.\n  This work investigates the application of a hierarchical Bayesian model to\ninfer expected distributions of deflection amplitudes at both the population\nand domain levels, with the aim of detecting excessive initial deflections in a\npopulation of plate elements. Although these damages are typically localized,\nthey can trigger unexpected events, if not properly monitored. The work is\nconducted in a numerical setting using a Finite Element model to generate\nstrain response data, which serve as the monitoring data. Bayesian inference\nwas conducted using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), with a surrogate model\nemployed to calculate the likelihood function. The hierarchical approach was\ncompared to an independent model for a plate component with few data. The\nresults revealed that, under data sparsity conditions, the hierarchical model\ncan offer more robust results in terms of uncertainty, which is essential for\ndecision-making tasks."}

Utilizing rich French administrative panel\ndata (2012-2019), this study has two main contributions: first, it presents a\nset of new, intuitive yet previously undocumented stylized facts about wage\ndynamics, sectoral mobility, and gender differences across sectors. The results\nreveal that the modest hourly wage gaps conceal substantial disparities in\nlifetime earnings and employment stability. Women, in particular, gain a\nsignificant lifetime earnings advantage in the public sector, driven by higher\nretention, better-compensated part-time work, and more equitable annual hours\ncompared to the private sector, where gender gaps remain larger, especially for\nthose with higher education. In contrast, highly educated men experience a\nlifetime penalty in public employment due to rigid wage structures. By flexibly\nmodeling sectoral transitions, transitions into and out of employment, and\nearnings heterogeneity using an Expectation-Maximization algorithm, this study\nshows that both premiums and penalties depend systematically on gender,\neducation, and labor market experience.

The prevailing\njudicial focus on website content and the dismissal of trespass claims absent\nproof of server impairment or user disruption misconstrues the nature of the\nwebsite itself as a form of digital property, focusing too narrowly on what\nconstitutes harm under a claim of trespass. By shifting analysis from content\nto the website itself as an integrated digital asset and illustrating the harm\nto the value of the chattel, this paper demonstrates that the right to exclude\napplies online with the same force as it does to tangible property.\n  Courts and litigants have struggled to police large-scale scraping because\ncopyright preemption narrows available claims, leaving copyright and its fair\nuse defense as the primary battleground. In contrast, recognizing websites as\npersonal property revives trespass to chattels as a meaningful cause of action,\nproviding website owners with an enforceable exclusionary right. Such\nprotection would disincentivize exploitative scraping, preserve incentives for\ncontent creation, aid in protecting privacy and personal data, and safeguard\nvalues of autonomy and expression. Ultimately, this paper contends that\nreaffirming website owners' right to exclude is essential to maintaining a fair\nand sustainable online environment."}

Citizens partially internalize the consequences of\nconcealment by imagining a world in which everyone acted similarly, linking\ntheir compliance decisions to the perceived effectiveness of public spending. A\nselfish elite chooses between public goods and private rents, taking compliance\nas given. In equilibrium, citizens' moral internalization expands the feasible\ntax base and induces elites to allocate resources toward provision rather than\nappropriation. When the value of public spending is uncertain, morality enables\ncredible reform: high-value elites can signal their type through provision,\nprompting citizens to increase compliance and raising fiscal capacity within\nthe same period. The analysis thus identifies a moral channel through which\nstates may escape low-capacity traps even under weak institutions."}

We develop a unified approach that begins by translating\nstructural models with latent variables into their induced statistical models\nof observables and then analyzes local overidentification through conditional\nmoment restrictions. We apply this approach to three leading models: (i) the\ngeneral treatment model under unconfoundedness, (ii) the negative control\nmodel, and (iii) the long-term causal inference model under unobserved\nconfounding. The first design yields a locally just-identified statistical\nmodel, implying that all regular asymptotically linear estimators of the\ntreatment effect share the same asymptotic variance, equal to the (trivial)\nsemiparametric efficiency bound. In contrast, the latter two models involve\nnonparametric endogeneity and are naturally locally overidentified;\nconsequently, some doubly robust orthogonal moment estimators of the average\ntreatment effect are inefficient.

With the rising cost of education and issues in the education\nsector, such as curriculum relevance, student engagement, and rapidly changing\ntechnological advancements, ensuring the relevance of academic programs in a\nfast-evolving job market has created a significant concern for educational\ninstitutions. With the intent to adapt to such challenges, educational\ninstitutions are dealing with alternative solutions for education, in which\nmicro-credentials are at the very center of this, which are short-term academic\nprograms or standalone courses. However, one of the challenges of\nmicro-credentials is a lack of credit transfer among institutions. With the\nlack of standardization of assessments among educational institutions, it is\ndifficult to transfer micro-credentials to larger qualifications. Regarding\nsuch challenges, micro-credentials with blockchain technology can bring\nsignificant benefits. Blockchain technology offers a decentralized and\nimmutable platform for securely storing and verifying credentials. This paper\npresents a prototype model for micro-credential verification. With the policies\ndecided by the educational institution, the learner provides a micro-credential\ncertificate to the system. Upon validation of the certificate by the verifying\nbody, the educational institution will review the assessment criteria and\nprovide exemptions based on the provided criteria. The prototype uses the\nHyper-ledger Fabric platform and utilizes off-chain technology, which acts as a\nmiddle-man storage platform. With the combination of off-chain and on-chain\ntechnologies, congestion on the blockchain is reduced, and transaction speed is\nimproved. In summary, this research proposes a prototype for secure\nmicro-credential verification and a more efficient course exemption process."}

We develop the Effective Trade Model (ETM),\nwhere transactions arise from bilateral feasibility rather than aggregate\nsupply and demand desires. Within this framework, we establish the main\nproperties of the price-demand correspondence and prove the existence of Nash\nequilibria, incorporating production, money, and network topology. The analysis\nextends to time, uncertainty, and open economies, revealing how loanable funds\nand exchange rates emerge endogenously. Our results show that equilibrium is\nshaped by transaction constraints, subjective pricing, and decentralized\nnegotiation, rather than by universal market-clearing conditions, and thereby\ncall into question the foundations of welfare theory. Anticipation is modeled\nvia the conditional mode, capturing bounded rationality and information\nlimitations in contrast to the rational expectations hypothesis. The ETM thus\noffers a behaviorally and structurally grounded alternative to classical\ngeneral equilibrium, bridging microfoundations, monetary dynamics, and temporal\nconsistency within a unified framework."}

We therefore introduce a dataset of 1,893 user questions\nfor household robots, collected from 100 participants and organized into 12\ncategories and 70 subcategories. Most work in explainable robotics focuses on\nwhy-questions. In contrast, our dataset provides a wide variety of questions,\nfrom questions about simple execution details to questions about how the robot\nwould act in hypothetical scenarios -- thus giving roboticists valuable\ninsights into what questions their robot needs to be able to answer. To collect\nthe dataset, we created 15 video stimuli and 7 text stimuli, depicting robots\nperforming varied household tasks. We then asked participants on Prolific what\nquestions they would want to ask the robot in each portrayed situation. In the\nfinal dataset, the most frequent categories are questions about task execution\ndetails (22.5%), the robot's capabilities (12.7%), and performance assessments\n(11.3%).

It is hotly debated whether data protection law applies\nto behavioural targeting. Many behavioural targeting companies say that, as\nlong as they do not tie names to data they hold about individuals, they do not\nprocess any personal data, and that, therefore, data protection law does not\napply to them. European Data Protection Authorities, however, take the view\nthat a company processes personal data if it uses data to single out a person,\neven if it cannot tie a name to these data. This paper argues that data\nprotection law should indeed apply to behavioural targeting. Companies can\noften tie a name to nameless data about individuals. Furthermore, behavioural\ntargeting relies on collecting information about individuals, singling out\nindividuals, and targeting ads to individuals. Many privacy risks remain,\nregardless of whether companies tie a name to the information they hold about a\nperson. A name is merely one of the identifiers that can be tied to data about\na person, and it is not even the most practical identifier for behavioural\ntargeting. Seeing data used to single out a person as personal data fits the\nrationale for data protection law: protecting fairness and privacy."}

Traditional approaches are typically\nconstrained by their reliance on domain-specific expertise to customize\nplanners, and often struggle with spatio-temporal couplings that usually lead\nto infeasible motions or discrepancies between task planning and motion\nexecution. Despite the proficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs) in\nhigh-level semantic reasoning, hallucination could result in infeasible motion\nplans. In this paper, we introduce the T3 Planner, an LLM-enabled robotic\nmotion planning framework that self-corrects it output with formal methods. The\nframework decomposes spatio-temporal task constraints via three cascaded\nmodules, each of which stimulates an LLM to generate candidate trajectory\nsequences and examines their feasibility via a Signal Temporal Logic (STL)\nverifier until one that satisfies complex spatial, temporal, and logical\nconstraints is found.Experiments across different scenarios show that T3\nPlanner significantly outperforms the baselines. The required reasoning can be\ndistilled into a lightweight Qwen3-4B model that enables efficient deployment.\nAll supplementary materials are accessible at\nhttps://github.com/leeejia/T3_Planner."}

This work addresses the\nchallenge of descriptively identifying a unique \"signature\" (local point cloud)\nby leveraging a detectable, high-precision \"anchor\" (like a pole). To solve\nthis, we propose a novel canonical representation, \"Pole-Image,\" as a hybrid\nmethod that uses poles as anchors to generate signatures from the surrounding\n3D structure. Pole-Image represents a pole-like landmark and its surrounding\nenvironment, detected from a LiDAR point cloud, as a 2D polar coordinate image\nwith the pole itself as the origin. This representation leverages the pole's\nnature as a high-precision reference point, explicitly encoding the \"relative\ngeometry\" between the stable pole and the variable surrounding point cloud. The\nkey advantage of pole landmarks is that \"detection\" is extremely easy. This\nease of detection allows the robot to easily track the same pole, enabling the\nautomatic and large-scale collection of diverse observational data (positive\npairs). This data acquisition feasibility makes \"Contrastive Learning (CL)\"\napplicable. By applying CL, the model learns a viewpoint-invariant and highly\ndiscriminative descriptor.

Grounded in philosophy of\nmind and cognitive phenomenology, SCL bridges conceptual philosophy and\nimplementable cognition. Drawing on process philosophy, enactive cognition, and\nextended mind theory, we define intelligence not as a property but as a\nperformed process -- a continuous loop of judgment, memory, control, action,\nand regulation. SCL makes three contributions. First, it operationalizes\nphilosophical insights into computationally interpretable structures, enabling\n\"executable epistemology\" -- philosophy as structural experiment. Second, it\nshows that functional separation within cognitive architecture yields more\ncoherent and interpretable behavior than monolithic prompt based systems,\nsupported by agent evaluations. Third, it redefines intelligence: not\nrepresentational accuracy but the capacity to reconstruct its own epistemic\nstate through intentional understanding. This framework impacts philosophy of\nmind, epistemology, and AI. For philosophy, it allows theories of cognition to\nbe enacted and tested. For AI, it grounds behavior in epistemic structure\nrather than statistical regularity.

Extensive Monte-Carlo simulations on the open Kacem~1--4\nbenchmark suite show that our hybrid approach eliminates 100\\% of deadline\nviolations observed in state-of-the-art meta-heuristic schedules, while adding\nonly 3--5\\% makespan overhead.

Such interactions between users and an\nalgorithm often unfold over multiple steps, during which strategic users can\nguide the algorithm to better align with their true interests by selectively\nengaging with content. However, users frequently exhibit inconsistent\npreferences: they may spend considerable time on content that offers little\nlong-term value, inadvertently signaling that such content is desirable.\nFocusing on the user side, this raises a key question: what does it take for\nsuch users to align the algorithm with their true interests?\n  To investigate these dynamics, we model the user's decision process as split\nbetween a rational system 2 that decides whether to engage and an impulsive\nsystem 1 that determines how long engagement lasts. We then study a\nmulti-leader, single-follower extensive Stackelberg game, where users,\nspecifically system 2, lead by committing to engagement strategies and the\nalgorithm best-responds based on observed interactions.

We evaluate our approach on KernelBench, a benchmark for\nLLM-based kernel optimization, and demonstrate substantial improvements over\nbaseline agents: our system produces correct solutions where baselines often\nfail, and achieves kernels with up to 16x faster runtime performance. These\nresults highlight the potential of agentic LLM frameworks to advance fully\nautomated, scalable GPU kernel optimization."}

In this work, we employ\nmulti-agent influence diagrams (MAIDs) as a graphical framework to address the\nabove issues. First, we introduce interaction paradigms that leverage MAIDs to\nanalyze and visualize existing approaches in MARL. Then, we design a new\ninteraction paradigm based on MAIDs, referred to as targeted intervention that\nis applied to only a single targeted agent, so the problem of global guidance\ncan be mitigated. In our implementation, we introduce a causal inference\ntechnique-referred to as Pre-Strategy Intervention (PSI)-to realize the\ntargeted intervention paradigm. Since MAIDs can be regarded as a special class\nof causal diagrams, a composite desired outcome that integrates the primary\ntask goal and an additional desired outcome can be achieved by maximizing the\ncorresponding causal effect through the PSI. Moreover, the bundled relevance\ngraph analysis of MAIDs provides a tool to identify whether an MARL learning\nparadigm is workable under the design of an interaction paradigm.

Despite\nadvances in robotic platforms, existing systems are predominantly follow-leader\nin nature, requiring continuous physician input and lacking intelligent\nautonomy. This dependency contributes to operator fatigue, more radiation\nexposure, and variability in procedural outcomes. This work moves towards\nautonomous catheter navigation by introducing DINO-CVA, a multimodal\ngoal-conditioned behavior cloning framework. The proposed model fuses visual\nobservations and joystick kinematics into a joint embedding space, enabling\npolicies that are both vision-aware and kinematic-aware. Actions are predicted\nautoregressively from expert demonstrations, with goal conditioning guiding\nnavigation toward specified destinations. A robotic experimental setup with a\nsynthetic vascular phantom was designed to collect multimodal datasets and\nevaluate performance. Results show that DINO-CVA achieves high accuracy in\npredicting actions, matching the performance of a kinematics-only baseline\nwhile additionally grounding predictions in the anatomical environment. These\nfindings establish the feasibility of multimodal, goal-conditioned\narchitectures for catheter navigation, representing an important step toward\nreducing operator dependency and improving the reliability of catheterbased\ntherapies."}

A variety of components must be grasped and removed in\nspecific sequences, determined by human instructions and/or by task-order\nfeasibility decisions made by the autonomous system.
