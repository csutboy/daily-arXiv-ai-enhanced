However, effective dynamic shape\ncontrol requires a controller that accounts for the robot's high-dimensional\ndynamics--a challenge exacerbated by a lack of general-purpose tools for\nmodeling soft robots amenably for control. In this work, we conduct a\ncomparative study of data-driven model reduction techniques for generating\nlinear models amendable to dynamic shape control. We focus on three\nmethods--the eigensystem realization algorithm, dynamic mode decomposition with\ncontrol, and the Lagrangian operator inference (LOpInf) method. Using each\nclass of model, we explored their efficacy in model predictive control policies\nfor the dynamic shape control of a simulated eel-inspired soft robot in three\nexperiments: 1) tracking simulated reference trajectories guaranteed to be\nfeasible, 2) tracking reference trajectories generated from a biological model\nof eel kinematics, and 3) tracking reference trajectories generated by a\nreduced-scale physical analog. In all experiments, the LOpInf-based policies\ngenerated lower tracking errors than policies based on other models."}

While Unmanned\nAerial Vehicle (UAV) swarms offer a promising solution for tasks like wide-area\nsearch and supply delivery, yet their effective coordination places a\nsignificant cognitive burden on human operators. The core human-machine\ncollaboration bottleneck lies in the ``intention-to-action gap'', which is an\nerror-prone process of translating a high-level rescue objective into a\nlow-level swarm command under high intensity and pressure. To bridge this gap,\nthis study proposes a novel LLM-CRF system that leverages Large Language Models\n(LLMs) to model and augment human-swarm teaming cognition. The proposed\nframework initially captures the operator's intention through natural and\nmulti-modal interactions with the device via voice or graphical annotations. It\nthen employs the LLM as a cognitive engine to perform intention comprehension,\nhierarchical task decomposition, and mission planning for the UAV swarm. This\nclosed-loop framework enables the swarm to act as a proactive partner,\nproviding active feedback in real-time while reducing the need for manual\nmonitoring and control, which considerably advances the efficacy of the SAR\ntask. We evaluate the proposed framework in a simulated SAR scenario.\nExperimental results demonstrate that, compared to traditional order and\ncommand-based interfaces, the proposed LLM-driven approach reduced task\ncompletion time by approximately $64.2\\%$ and improved task success rate by\n$7\\%$. It also leads to a considerable reduction in subjective cognitive\nworkload, with NASA-TLX scores dropping by $42.9\\%$.

To address these challenges, we\nintroduce DreamGym, the first unified framework designed to synthesize diverse\nexperiences with scalability in mind to enable effective online RL training for\nautonomous agents. Rather than relying on expensive real-environment rollouts,\nDreamGym distills environment dynamics into a reasoning-based experience model\nthat derives consistent state transitions and feedback signals through\nstep-by-step reasoning, enabling scalable agent rollout collection for RL. To\nimprove the stability and quality of transitions, DreamGym leverages an\nexperience replay buffer initialized with offline real-world data and\ncontinuously enriched with fresh interactions to actively support agent\ntraining. To improve knowledge acquisition, DreamGym adaptively generates new\ntasks that challenge the current agent policy, enabling more effective online\ncurriculum learning. Experiments across diverse environments and agent\nbackbones demonstrate that DreamGym substantially improves RL training, both in\nfully synthetic settings and in sim-to-real transfer scenarios. On non-RL-ready\ntasks like WebArena, DreamGym outperforms all baselines by over 30%. And in\nRL-ready but costly settings, it matches GRPO and PPO performance using only\nsynthetic interactions.

Despite its significance, tokenization in the\ncontext of assembly code remains an underexplored area. This study aims to\naddress this gap by evaluating the intrinsic properties of Natural Language\nProcessing (NLP) tokenization models and parameter choices, such as vocabulary\nsize. We explore preprocessing customization options and pre-tokenization rules\ntailored to the unique characteristics of assembly code. Additionally, we\nassess their impact on downstream tasks like function signature prediction -- a\ncritical problem in binary code analysis.\n  To this end, we conduct a thorough study on various tokenization models,\nsystematically analyzing their efficiency in encoding assembly instructions and\ncapturing semantic nuances. Through intrinsic evaluations, we compare\ntokenizers based on tokenization efficiency, vocabulary compression, and\nrepresentational fidelity for assembly code. Using state-of-the-art pre-trained\nmodels such as the decoder-only Large Language Model (LLM) Llama 3.2, the\nencoder-only transformer BERT, and the encoder-decoder model BART, we evaluate\nthe effectiveness of these tokenizers across multiple performance metrics.\nPreliminary findings indicate that tokenizer choice significantly influences\ndownstream performance, with intrinsic metrics providing partial but incomplete\npredictability of extrinsic evaluation outcomes. These results reveal complex\ntrade-offs between intrinsic tokenizer properties and their utility in\npractical assembly code tasks. Ultimately, this study provides valuable\ninsights into optimizing tokenization models for low-level code analysis,\ncontributing to the robustness and scalability of Natural Language Model\n(NLM)-based binary analysis workflows."}

However, empirical\nfindings indicate that markers often exhibit varying performances across\npopulations. For prognostic markers whose results are used to quantify of the\nrisk of an outcome, oftentimes a form of updating is required when the marker\nis transported to populations with different disease prevalences. Here, we\nrevisit transportability of prognostic markers through the lens of the\nfoundational framework of sufficient component causes (SCC). We argue that\ntransporting a marker \"as is\" implicitly assumes predictive values are\ntransportable, whereas conventional prevalence-adjustment shifts the locus of\ntransportability to accuracy metrics (sensitivity and specificity). Using a\nminimalist SCC framework that decomposes risk prediction into its causal\nconstituents, we show that both approaches rely on strong assumptions about the\nstability of cause distributions across populations. A SCC framework instead\ninvites making transparent assumptions about how different causes vary across\npopulations, leading to different transportation methods. For example, in the\nabsence of any external information other than disease prevalence, a\ncause-neutral perspective can assume all causes are responsible for change in\nprevalence, leading to a new form of marker transportation. Numerical\nexperiments demonstrate that different transportability assumptions lead to\nvarying degrees of information loss, depending on how population differ from\neach other in the distribution of causes. A SCC perspective challenges common\nassumptions and practices for marker transportability, and proposes\ntransportation algorithms that reflect our knowledge or assumptions about how\ncauses vary across populations."}

This paper\npresents a biomimetic control framework based on Spiking Neural Networks (SNN),\ninspired by the human Central Nervous System (CNS), to achieve agile control in\nsuch environments. The proposed framework features five control modules\n(cerebral cortex, cerebellum, thalamus, brainstem, spinal cord), three\nhierarchical control levels (first-order, second-order, third-order), and two\ninformation pathways (ascending, descending). Each module is fully implemented\nusing SNN. The spinal cord module uses spike encoding and Leaky\nIntegrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons for feedback control. The brainstem module\nemploys a network of LIF and non-spiking LIF neurons to dynamically adjust\nspinal cord parameters via reinforcement learning. The thalamus module\nsimilarly adjusts the cerebellum's torque outputs. The cerebellum module uses a\nrecurrent SNN to learn the robotic arm's dynamics through regression, providing\nfeedforward gravity compensation torques. The framework is validated both in\nsimulation and on real-world robotic arm platform under various loads and\ntrajectories.

Motivated by practical considerations,\nwe introduce a weakened incentive requirement, namely\nSD-top-strategy-proofness, which precludes only those manipulations that\nincrease the probability of an agent's top-ranked object.\n  Our first main result shows that, on any free pair at the top (FPT) domain\n(Sen, 2011), the TTC rule is the unique probabilistic assignment rule\nsatisfying SD-Pareto efficiency, SD-individual rationality, and\nSD-top-strategy-proofness. We further show that this characterization remains\nvalid when Pareto efficiency is replaced by the weaker notion of SD-pair\nefficiency, provided the domain satisfies the slightly stronger free triple at\nthe top (FTT) condition (Sen, 2011). Finally, we extend these results to the ex\npost notions of efficiency and individual rationality.\n  Together, our findings generalize the classical deterministic results of Ma\n(1994) and Ekici (2024) along three dimensions: extending them from\ndeterministic to probabilistic settings, from full strategy-proofness to\ntop-strategy-proofness, and from the unrestricted domain to the more general\nFPT and FTT domains."}

Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT), which\nleverages a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to predict student knowledge and\nperformance on exercises, has been proposed as a major advancement over\ntraditional KT methods. Several studies suggest that its performance gains stem\nfrom its ability to model bidirectional relationships between different\nknowledge components (KCs) within a course, enabling the inference of a\nstudent's understanding of one KC from their performance on others. In this\npaper, we challenge this prevailing explanation and demonstrate that DKT's\nstrength lies in its implicit ability to model prerequisite relationships as a\ncausal structure, rather than bidirectional relationships. By pruning exercise\nrelation graphs into Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and training DKT on causal\nsubsets of the Assistments dataset, we show that DKT's predictive capabilities\nalign strongly with these causal structures. Furthermore, we propose an\nalternative method for extracting exercise relation DAGs using DKT's learned\nrepresentations and provide empirical evidence supporting our claim. Our\nfindings suggest that DKT's effectiveness is largely driven by its capacity to\napproximate causal dependencies between KCs rather than simple relational\nmappings."}

Conventional pipelines have widely relied on RGB-D cameras to\nprovide geometric information, which fail on transparent or glossy objects and\ndegrade at close range. We present GraspView, an RGB-only robotic grasping\npipeline that achieves accurate manipulation in cluttered environments without\ndepth sensors. Our framework integrates three key components: (i) global\nperception scene reconstruction, which provides locally consistent, up-to-scale\ngeometry from a single RGB view and fuses multi-view projections into a\ncoherent global 3D scene; (ii) a render-and-score active perception strategy,\nwhich dynamically selects next-best-views to reveal occluded regions; and (iii)\nan online metric alignment module that calibrates VGGT predictions against\nrobot kinematics to ensure physical scale consistency. Building on these\ntailor-designed modules, GraspView performs best-view global grasping, fusing\nmulti-view reconstructions and leveraging GraspNet for robust execution.\nExperiments on diverse tabletop objects demonstrate that GraspView\nsignificantly outperforms both RGB-D and single-view RGB baselines, especially\nunder heavy occlusion, near-field sensing, and with transparent objects.

At the same\ntime, there are well-documented imbalances in the training data and\noptimisation objectives of this technology, raising doubts as to whether LLMs\ncan represent the cultural diversity of their broad user base. In this study,\nwe look at LLMs and cultural values and examine how prompt language and\ncultural framing influence model responses and their alignment with human\nvalues in different countries. We probe 10 LLMs with 63 items from the Hofstede\nValues Survey Module and World Values Survey, translated into 11 languages, and\nformulated as prompts with and without different explicit cultural\nperspectives. Our study confirms that both prompt language and cultural\nperspective produce variation in LLM outputs, but with an important caveat:\nWhile targeted prompting can, to a certain extent, steer LLM responses in the\ndirection of the predominant values of the corresponding countries, it does not\novercome the models' systematic bias toward the values associated with a\nrestricted set of countries in our dataset: the Netherlands, Germany, the US,\nand Japan. All tested models, regardless of their origin, exhibit remarkably\nsimilar patterns: They produce fairly neutral responses on most topics, with\nselective progressive stances on issues such as social tolerance. Alignment\nwith cultural values of human respondents is improved more with an explicit\ncultural perspective than with a targeted prompt language. Unexpectedly,\ncombining both approaches is no more effective than cultural framing with an\nEnglish prompt. These findings reveal that LLMs occupy an uncomfortable middle\nground: They are responsive enough to changes in prompts to produce variation,\nbut too firmly anchored to specific cultural defaults to adequately represent\ncultural diversity."}

This study develops analytical\noptimization models for SLAM bus service that integrates vehicle-to-vehicle\n(V2V) charging technology. By comparing the optimal designs and their\nfeasibility across non-charging case and charging strategies, we identify a\nsequence of operational stages as ridership grows: from idle capacity under low\ndemand, to full small buses, full large buses, and a proposed frequency-capped\nregime where only bus capacity expands. Under the mobile charging strategy,\nthis progression further includes an energy-limited regime, in which frequency\ndeclines, and ultimately infeasibility under high demand.

To address these challenges, we\nintroduce DreamGym, the first unified framework designed to synthesize diverse\nexperiences with scalability in mind to enable effective online RL training for\nautonomous agents. Rather than relying on expensive real-environment rollouts,\nDreamGym distills environment dynamics into a reasoning-based experience model\nthat derives consistent state transitions and feedback signals through\nstep-by-step reasoning, enabling scalable agent rollout collection for RL. To\nimprove the stability and quality of transitions, DreamGym leverages an\nexperience replay buffer initialized with offline real-world data and\ncontinuously enriched with fresh interactions to actively support agent\ntraining. To improve knowledge acquisition, DreamGym adaptively generates new\ntasks that challenge the current agent policy, enabling more effective online\ncurriculum learning. Experiments across diverse environments and agent\nbackbones demonstrate that DreamGym substantially improves RL training, both in\nfully synthetic settings and in sim-to-real transfer scenarios. On non-RL-ready\ntasks like WebArena, DreamGym outperforms all baselines by over 30%. And in\nRL-ready but costly settings, it matches GRPO and PPO performance using only\nsynthetic interactions.

To address\nthis limitation, we propose a novel algorithm, Temporal Action Selector (TAS),\nwhich caches predicted action chunks from multiple timesteps and dynamically\nselects the optimal action through a lightweight selector network. TAS achieves\nbalanced optimization across three critical dimensions: reactivity, decision\nconsistency, and motion coherence.

Instantiated as an information\nbottleneck objective, it prompts agents to learn not only who and what to\ncommunicate but also when. At the foundation of this framework lies a\ngrid-cell-like metric as internal spatial coding for self-localization,\nemerging spontaneously from self-supervised motion prediction. Building upon\nthis internal spatial code, agents gradually develop a bandwidth-efficient\ncommunication mechanism and specialized neural populations that encode\npartners' locations: an artificial analogue of hippocampal social place cells\n(SPCs). These social representations are further enacted by a hierarchical\nreinforcement learning policy that actively explores to reduce joint\nuncertainty. On the Memory-Maze benchmark, our approach shows exceptional\nresilience to bandwidth constraints: success degrades gracefully from 73.5% to\n64.4% as bandwidth shrinks from 128 to 4 bits/step, whereas a full-broadcast\nbaseline collapses from 67.6% to 28.6%. Our findings establish a theoretically\nprincipled and biologically plausible basis for how complex social\nrepresentations emerge from a unified predictive drive, leading to social\ncollective intelligence."}

However, humans and robots differ\nfundamentally in embodiment, resulting in mismatched action execution. Direct\nkinematic retargeting of human hand motion can therefore produce actions that\nare physically infeasible for robots. Despite these low-level differences,\nhuman demonstrations provide valuable motion cues about how to manipulate and\ninteract with objects. Our key idea is to exploit the forward diffusion\nprocess: as noise is added to actions, low-level execution differences fade\nwhile high-level task guidance is preserved. We present X-Diffusion, a\nprincipled framework for training diffusion policies that maximally leverages\nhuman data without learning dynamically infeasible motions. X-Diffusion first\ntrains a classifier to predict whether a noisy action is executed by a human or\nrobot. Then, a human action is incorporated into policy training only after\nadding sufficient noise such that the classifier cannot discern its embodiment.\nActions consistent with robot execution supervise fine-grained denoising at low\nnoise levels, while mismatched human actions provide only coarse guidance at\nhigher noise levels. Our experiments show that naive co-training under\nexecution mismatches degrades policy performance, while X-Diffusion\nconsistently improves it. Across five manipulation tasks, X-Diffusion achieves\na 16% higher average success rate than the best baseline. The project website\nis available at https://portal-cornell.github.io/X-Diffusion/."}

Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT), which\nleverages a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to predict student knowledge and\nperformance on exercises, has been proposed as a major advancement over\ntraditional KT methods. Several studies suggest that its performance gains stem\nfrom its ability to model bidirectional relationships between different\nknowledge components (KCs) within a course, enabling the inference of a\nstudent's understanding of one KC from their performance on others. In this\npaper, we challenge this prevailing explanation and demonstrate that DKT's\nstrength lies in its implicit ability to model prerequisite relationships as a\ncausal structure, rather than bidirectional relationships. By pruning exercise\nrelation graphs into Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and training DKT on causal\nsubsets of the Assistments dataset, we show that DKT's predictive capabilities\nalign strongly with these causal structures. Furthermore, we propose an\nalternative method for extracting exercise relation DAGs using DKT's learned\nrepresentations and provide empirical evidence supporting our claim.

In this study,\nwe look at LLMs and cultural values and examine how prompt language and\ncultural framing influence model responses and their alignment with human\nvalues in different countries. We probe 10 LLMs with 63 items from the Hofstede\nValues Survey Module and World Values Survey, translated into 11 languages, and\nformulated as prompts with and without different explicit cultural\nperspectives. Our study confirms that both prompt language and cultural\nperspective produce variation in LLM outputs, but with an important caveat:\nWhile targeted prompting can, to a certain extent, steer LLM responses in the\ndirection of the predominant values of the corresponding countries, it does not\novercome the models' systematic bias toward the values associated with a\nrestricted set of countries in our dataset: the Netherlands, Germany, the US,\nand Japan. All tested models, regardless of their origin, exhibit remarkably\nsimilar patterns: They produce fairly neutral responses on most topics, with\nselective progressive stances on issues such as social tolerance. Alignment\nwith cultural values of human respondents is improved more with an explicit\ncultural perspective than with a targeted prompt language.

Yet, since they\nwere not originally designed for DM, recent studies show that LLMs can struggle\neven in basic online DM problems, failing to achieve low regret or an effective\nexploration-exploitation tradeoff. To address this, we introduce Iterative\nRegret-Minimization Fine-Tuning (Iterative RMFT), a post-training procedure\nthat repeatedly distills low-regret decision trajectories back into the base\nmodel. At each iteration, the model rolls out multiple decision trajectories,\nselects the k-lowest regret ones, and fine-tunes itself on them. Unlike prior\nmethods that (a) distill action sequences from known DM algorithms or (b) rely\non manually crafted chain-of-thought templates, our approach leverages the\nregret metric to elicit the model's own DM ability and reasoning rationales.\nThis reliance on model-generated reasoning avoids rigid output engineering and\nprovides more flexible, natural-language training signals. Empirical results\nshow that Iterative RMFT improves LLMs' DM performance across diverse models -\nfrom Transformers with numerical input/output, to open-weight LLMs, and\nadvanced closed-weight models like GPT-4o mini. Its flexibility in output and\nreasoning formats enables generalization across tasks with varying horizons,\naction spaces, reward processes, and natural-language contexts. Finally, we\nprovide theoretical insight showing that a single-layer Transformer under this\nparadigm can act as a no-regret learner in a simplified setting.

To solve this problem, we propose to apply\nthe Recurrent Equilibrium Networks (RENs) to learn the unknown dynamics using\nthe data from the real-time system states. The input-output property of this\nREN model is guaranteed by incremental integral quadratic constraints (IQCs).\nThen, we propose a funnel-based control method to achieve system recovery from\nthe deviated states. In particular, a sufficient condition for nominal\ntrajectory stabilization is derived together with the invariant funnels along\nthe nominal trajectory. Eventually, the effectiveness of our proposed control\nmethod is illustrated by a simulation example of a DC microgrid control\napplication."}

While Unmanned\nAerial Vehicle (UAV) swarms offer a promising solution for tasks like wide-area\nsearch and supply delivery, yet their effective coordination places a\nsignificant cognitive burden on human operators. The core human-machine\ncollaboration bottleneck lies in the ``intention-to-action gap'', which is an\nerror-prone process of translating a high-level rescue objective into a\nlow-level swarm command under high intensity and pressure. To bridge this gap,\nthis study proposes a novel LLM-CRF system that leverages Large Language Models\n(LLMs) to model and augment human-swarm teaming cognition. The proposed\nframework initially captures the operator's intention through natural and\nmulti-modal interactions with the device via voice or graphical annotations.

While Unmanned\nAerial Vehicle (UAV) swarms offer a promising solution for tasks like wide-area\nsearch and supply delivery, yet their effective coordination places a\nsignificant cognitive burden on human operators. The core human-machine\ncollaboration bottleneck lies in the ``intention-to-action gap'', which is an\nerror-prone process of translating a high-level rescue objective into a\nlow-level swarm command under high intensity and pressure.

The agent first\nproposes the skills to be acquired and constructs the corresponding simulation\nenvironments; it then configures objects into appropriate arrangements to\ngenerate skill-consistent goal states (\\textit{ForeGen}). Subsequently, the\nvirtually infinite data produced by ForeGen are used to train the proposed\nstate generation model (\\textit{ForeFormer}), which establishes point-wise\ncorrespondences by predicting the 3D goal position of every point in the\ncurrent state, based on the scene state and task instructions. Finally,\nclassical control algorithms are employed to drive the robot in real-world\nenvironments to execute actions based on the envisioned goal states. Compared\nwith end-to-end policy learning methods, ForeFormer offers superior\ninterpretability and execution efficiency. We train and benchmark ForeFormer\nacross a variety of rigid-body and articulated-object manipulation tasks, and\nobserve an average improvement of 56.32\\% over the state-of-the-art state\ngeneration models, demonstrating strong generality across different\nmanipulation patterns.

Yet, since they\nwere not originally designed for DM, recent studies show that LLMs can struggle\neven in basic online DM problems, failing to achieve low regret or an effective\nexploration-exploitation tradeoff. To address this, we introduce Iterative\nRegret-Minimization Fine-Tuning (Iterative RMFT), a post-training procedure\nthat repeatedly distills low-regret decision trajectories back into the base\nmodel. At each iteration, the model rolls out multiple decision trajectories,\nselects the k-lowest regret ones, and fine-tunes itself on them. Unlike prior\nmethods that (a) distill action sequences from known DM algorithms or (b) rely\non manually crafted chain-of-thought templates, our approach leverages the\nregret metric to elicit the model's own DM ability and reasoning rationales.\nThis reliance on model-generated reasoning avoids rigid output engineering and\nprovides more flexible, natural-language training signals. Empirical results\nshow that Iterative RMFT improves LLMs' DM performance across diverse models -\nfrom Transformers with numerical input/output, to open-weight LLMs, and\nadvanced closed-weight models like GPT-4o mini. Its flexibility in output and\nreasoning formats enables generalization across tasks with varying horizons,\naction spaces, reward processes, and natural-language contexts. Finally, we\nprovide theoretical insight showing that a single-layer Transformer under this\nparadigm can act as a no-regret learner in a simplified setting. Overall,\nIterative RMFT offers a principled and general post-training framework for\nenhancing LLMs' decision-making capabilities."}

The main challenges of this problem lie in (1) learning the\nunknown dynamics caused by attacks or failures with formal guarantees, and (2)\nfinding the invariant set of states to formally ensure the state deviations\nallowed from the nominal trajectory. To solve this problem, we propose to apply\nthe Recurrent Equilibrium Networks (RENs) to learn the unknown dynamics using\nthe data from the real-time system states. The input-output property of this\nREN model is guaranteed by incremental integral quadratic constraints (IQCs).\nThen, we propose a funnel-based control method to achieve system recovery from\nthe deviated states. In particular, a sufficient condition for nominal\ntrajectory stabilization is derived together with the invariant funnels along\nthe nominal trajectory. Eventually, the effectiveness of our proposed control\nmethod is illustrated by a simulation example of a DC microgrid control\napplication."}

WELL: Dynamic Reasoning and Learning with Symbolic World Model for Embodied LLM-Based Multi-Agent Collaboration", "comment": null, "summary": "Cooperative multi-agent planning requires agents to make joint decisions with\npartial information and limited communication. Coordination at the trajectory\nlevel often fails, as small deviations in timing or movement cascade into\nconflicts. Symbolic planning mitigates this challenge by raising the level of\nabstraction and providing a minimal vocabulary of actions that enable\nsynchronization and collective progress. We present DR. WELL, a decentralized\nneurosymbolic framework for cooperative multi-agent planning. Cooperation\nunfolds through a two-phase negotiation protocol: agents first propose\ncandidate roles with reasoning and then commit to a joint allocation under\nconsensus and environment constraints. After commitment, each agent\nindependently generates and executes a symbolic plan for its role without\nrevealing detailed trajectories. Plans are grounded in execution outcomes via a\nshared world model that encodes the current state and is updated as agents act.\nBy reasoning over symbolic plans rather than raw trajectories, DR. WELL avoids\nbrittle step-level alignment and enables higher-level operations that are\nreusable, synchronizable, and interpretable. Experiments on cooperative\nblock-push tasks show that agents adapt across episodes, with the dynamic world\nmodel capturing reusable patterns and improving task completion rates and\nefficiency. Experiments on cooperative block-push tasks show that our dynamic\nworld model improves task completion and efficiency through negotiation and\nself-refinement, trading a time overhead for evolving, more efficient\ncollaboration strategies."}

Shared autonomy has emerged as a promising approach to mitigate such\nfailures by incorporating human input when autonomy is uncertain. However, most\nexisting methods restrict arbitration to low-level trajectories, which\nrepresent only geometric paths and therefore fail to preserve the underlying\ndriving intent. We propose a unified shared autonomy framework that integrates\nhuman input and autonomous planners at a higher level of abstraction. Our\nmethod leverages Vision Language Models (VLMs) to infer driver intent from\nmulti-modal cues -- such as driver actions and environmental context -- and to\nsynthesize coherent strategies that mediate between human and autonomous\ncontrol. We first study the framework in a mock-human setting, where it\nachieves perfect recall alongside high accuracy and precision. A human-subject\nsurvey further shows strong alignment, with participants agreeing with\narbitration outcomes in 92% of cases. Finally, evaluation on the Bench2Drive\nbenchmark demonstrates a substantial reduction in collision rate and\nimprovement in overall performance compared to pure autonomy.

However, humans and robots differ\nfundamentally in embodiment, resulting in mismatched action execution. Direct\nkinematic retargeting of human hand motion can therefore produce actions that\nare physically infeasible for robots. Despite these low-level differences,\nhuman demonstrations provide valuable motion cues about how to manipulate and\ninteract with objects. Our key idea is to exploit the forward diffusion\nprocess: as noise is added to actions, low-level execution differences fade\nwhile high-level task guidance is preserved. We present X-Diffusion, a\nprincipled framework for training diffusion policies that maximally leverages\nhuman data without learning dynamically infeasible motions. X-Diffusion first\ntrains a classifier to predict whether a noisy action is executed by a human or\nrobot. Then, a human action is incorporated into policy training only after\nadding sufficient noise such that the classifier cannot discern its embodiment.\nActions consistent with robot execution supervise fine-grained denoising at low\nnoise levels, while mismatched human actions provide only coarse guidance at\nhigher noise levels. Our experiments show that naive co-training under\nexecution mismatches degrades policy performance, while X-Diffusion\nconsistently improves it.

However, most recent\nreinforcement learning (RL) policies emphasize rigid tracking and suppress\nexternal forces. Existing impedance-augmented approaches are typically\nrestricted to base or end-effector control and focus on resisting extreme\nforces rather than enabling compliance. We introduce GentleHumanoid, a\nframework that integrates impedance control into a whole-body motion tracking\npolicy to achieve upper-body compliance. At its core is a unified spring-based\nformulation that models both resistive contacts (restoring forces when pressing\nagainst surfaces) and guiding contacts (pushes or pulls sampled from human\nmotion data). This formulation ensures kinematically consistent forces across\nthe shoulder, elbow, and wrist, while exposing the policy to diverse\ninteraction scenarios. Safety is further supported through task-adjustable\nforce thresholds. We evaluate our approach in both simulation and on the\nUnitree G1 humanoid across tasks requiring different levels of compliance,\nincluding gentle hugging, sit-to-stand assistance, and safe object\nmanipulation. Compared to baselines, our policy consistently reduces peak\ncontact forces while maintaining task success, resulting in smoother and more\nnatural interactions.
