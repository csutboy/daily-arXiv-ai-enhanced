These individuals contribute to the\nspread of the epidemic and pose a significant challenge to public health\npolicies. Identifying asymptomatic individuals is critical for measuring and\ncontrolling an epidemic, but periodic and widespread testing of healthy\nindividuals is often too costly. This work tackles the problem of identifying\nasymptomatic individuals considering a classic SI (Susceptible-Infected)\nnetwork epidemic model where a fraction of the infected nodes are not observed\nas infected (i.e., their observed state is identical to susceptible nodes). In\norder to classify healthy nodes as asymptomatic or susceptible, a Graph Neural\nNetwork (GNN) model with supervised learning is adopted where a set of node\nfeatures are built from the network with observed infected nodes. The approach\nis evaluated across different network models, network sizes, and fraction of\nobserved infections. Results indicate that the proposed methodology is robust\nacross different scenarios, accurately identifying asymptomatic nodes while\nalso generalizing to different network sizes and fraction of observed\ninfections."}

However, modeling becomes increasingly\nchallenging when there are many candidate models available to describe the\nsystem behavior. Furthermore, uncertainties can be present even for the\nparameters of these model classes. The plausibility of each input-output model\nclass of the structures with uncertain components can be determined by a\nBayesian approach from measured dynamic responses to one or more input records;\npredictions of the structural system response to alternate input records can\nthen be made. However, this approach may require many model simulations, even\nthough most of those model classes are quite implausible. An approach is\nproposed herein to use a bound, computed from the false discovery rate, on the\nlikelihood of measured data to falsify models considering uncertainties in the\npassive control devices that do not reproduce the measured data to sufficient\naccuracy. Response prediction is then performed using the unfalsified models in\nan approximate Bayesian sense by assigning weights, computed from the\nlikelihoods, only to the unfalsified models approach incurring only a fraction\nof the computational cost of the standard Bayesian approach. The proposed\napproach for response prediction is illustrated using three structural\nexamples: an earthquake-excited four--degree-of-freedom building model with a\nhysteretic isolation layer; a 1623--degree-of-freedom three-dimensional\nbuilding model, with tuned mass dampers attached to its roof, subjected to wind\nloads; and a full-scale four-story base-isolated building tested on world's\nlargest shake table in Japan's E-Defense lab.

Admission\nrates fluctuate over time due to temporal factors, and length of stay (LOS)\ndistributions vary with patient heterogeneity, hospital location, case mix, and\nclinical practices. Common planning approaches rely on steady-state queueing\nmodels or heuristic rules that assume fixed parameters, but these methods often\nfall short in capturing real-world occupancy dynamics. One widely used example\nis the 85\\% occupancy rule, which recommends maintaining average utilization\nbelow this level to ensure responsiveness; however, this rule is based on\nstationary assumptions and may be unreliable when applied to time-varying\nsystems. Our analysis shows that even when long-run utilization targets are\nmet, day-to-day occupancy frequently exceeds 100\\% capacity.\n  We propose a data-driven framework for estimating ICU bed occupancy using an\n$M_t/G_t/\\infty$ queueing model, which incorporates time-varying arrival rates\nand empirically estimated LOS distributions. The framework combines statistical\ndecomposition and parametric distribution fitting to capture temporal patterns\nin ICU admissions and LOS. We apply it to multi-year data from neonatal ICUs\n(NICUs) in Calgary as a case study. Several capacity planning scenarios are\nevaluated, including average-based thresholds and surge estimates from Poisson\noverflow approximations.

These capabilities are vital for transmitting safety-critical data\nfrom Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) to improve metrics such as Time to\nCollision (TTC) and reduce the Collision Risk (CR) ratio. However, limited\nradio resources and interference remain major obstacles to achieving both\nprecision and capacity simultaneously. The challenge intensifies in\nmixedtraffic scenarios involving Human-Driven Vehicles (HDVs), which lack\nconnectivity and cannot share their status or positioning. Additionally, CAV\nsensors are limited in range and accuracy, making detection of HDVs unreliable.\nISAC plays a pivotal role here by enabling the sensing of HDV positions via\nshared communication infrastructure, improving environmental awareness. To\naddress these challenges, this paper proposes a novel Value of Information\n(VoI) metric that prioritizes the transmission of safety-critical data. The\njoint sensing-communication-control problem is modeled as a two-time-scale\nsequential decision process and solved using a Multi-Agent Distributed\nDeterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) algorithm. By focusing on high- VoI\ndata, the framework reduces complexity and optimizes network and traffic\nresource usage. Simulations show that the proposed approach significantly\nreduces the CR ratio by at least 33% and improves the TTC by up to 66%,\ndemonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing safety and efficiency in\nmixedautonomy environments."}

We propose the Autonomous Manager\nAgent as a core challenge: an agent that decomposes complex goals into task\ngraphs, allocates tasks to human and AI workers, monitors progress, adapts to\nchanging conditions, and maintains transparent stakeholder communication. We\nformalize workflow management as a Partially Observable Stochastic Game and\nidentify four foundational challenges: (1) compositional reasoning for\nhierarchical decomposition, (2) multi-objective optimization under shifting\npreferences, (3) coordination and planning in ad hoc teams, and (4) governance\nand compliance by design. To advance this agenda, we release MA-Gym, an\nopen-source simulation and evaluation framework for multi-agent workflow\norchestration. Evaluating GPT-5-based Manager Agents across 20 workflows, we\nfind they struggle to jointly optimize for goal completion, constraint\nadherence, and workflow runtime - underscoring workflow management as a\ndifficult open problem. We conclude with organizational and ethical\nimplications of autonomous management systems."}

We therefore propose scaling along the temperature\ndimension, which enlarges the reasoning boundary of LLMs. Averaged over Qwen3\n(0.6B, 1.7B, 4B, 8B) and five representative reasoning benchmarks (AIME\n2024/2025, MATH500, LiveCodeBench, Hi-ToM), temperature scaling yields an\nadditional 7.3 points over single-temperature TTS.

Followed\nby the integration of the developed, validated and optimized model into the\nelectric field calculation for life estimation of a 500 kV DC-XLPE insulated\ncable subjected to Type Test load cycles according to Cigre Techical Brochure\n852. The developed microscopic model is compared to the macroscopic models\nalready found in the literature. The microscopic model shows a comparable\nelectric field inversion similarly to macroscopic models. However, the behavior\nof the microscopic model is noticed to be different under heating and cooling\nload cycles. In hot cable, the maximum electric field stabilizes at different\namplitude and position inside the insulation thickness in both models. This\ninvestigation has been carried out in the framework of the HEU-NEWGEN research\nproject."}

Zadeh in 1978. This\nnew version was inspired by the original but, formally, has nothing in common\nwith it other than that they both adopt the {\\L}ukasiewicz multivalent\ninterpretation of the logical connectives. Moreover, rather than seeking to\nprovide a general notion of possibility, this focuses specifically on the\npossibility of a real-world event. An event is viewed as having prerequisites\nthat enable its occurrence and constraints that may impede its occurrence, and\nthe possibility of the event is computed as a function of the probabilities\nthat the prerequisites hold and the constraints do not. This version of\npossibility might appropriately be applied to problems of planning. When there\nare multiple plans available for achieving a goal, this theory can be used to\ndetermine which plan is most possible, i.e., easiest or most feasible to\ncomplete. It is speculated that this model of reasoning correctly captures\nnormal human reasoning about plans. The theory is elaborated and an\nillustrative example for vehicle route planning is provided.

This focus is not\npractical, as when adjacent feeders lack sufficient capacity, utilities may\nrequest support from more distant feeders in practice. Such a hirarchical\nrestoration is complex, especially when involving changing system conditions\ndue to cold load pickup and delayed reconnection of behind-the-meter DERs. To\nfill this research gap, a situationally aware multi-tier load restoration\nframework is proposed. Specifically, models are proposed to describe the\nmulti-tier load restoration, including the multi-tier load transfer and\nsubstation transformer and feeder protection models. By introducing binary\nactional switching variables and load block transfer variables, the models\neffectively captures the dynamics of switches and multi-tier transfer process.\nTo integrate situational awareness of evolving system conditions, the problem\nis formulated as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) and then embedded within\na rolling horizon optimization.

However, as the number of steps required to resolve a user\nrequest increases, a proper evaluation of an agent's performance must go beyond\nthe final answer to also assess the problem-solving trajectory, including\npreviously ignored aspects such as efficiency, hallucination, and adaptivity.\nThe most straightforward method for evaluating these aspects is to compare an\nagent's trajectory with the ground-truth trajectory, but this approach is\nfundamentally limited since annotating all valid ground-truth trajectories is\nprohibitively expensive.

Recently, radar technologies, such as ultra-wideband (UWB) have\nemerged as potential alternatives due to their ability to see through adverse\nenvironmental conditions (e.g. dust, smoke and rain). However, due to the small\napertures with low directivity, the UWB radars cannot reconstruct a detailed\nimage of its field of view (FOV) using a single scan. Hence, a virtual large\naperture is synthesized by moving the radar along a mobile robot path. The\nresulting synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image is a high-definition\nrepresentation of the surrounding environment. Hence, this paper proposes a\npipeline for mobile robots to incorporate UWB radar-based SAR imaging to map an\nunknown environment. Finally, we evaluated the performance of classical feature\ndetectors: SIFT, SURF, BRISK, AKAZE and ORB to identify loop closures using UWB\nSAR images.

A Correlation Analysis", "comment": null, "summary": "Social, also called human-aware, navigation is a key challenge for the\nintegration of mobile robots into human environments. The evaluation of such\nsystems is complex, as factors such as comfort, safety, and legibility must be\nconsidered. Human-centered assessments, typically conducted through surveys,\nprovide reliable insights but are costly, resource-intensive, and difficult to\nreproduce or compare across systems. Alternatively, numerical social navigation\nmetrics are easy to compute and facilitate comparisons, yet the community lacks\nconsensus on a standard set of metrics.\n  This work explores the relationship between numerical metrics and\nhuman-centered evaluations to identify potential correlations. If specific\nquantitative measures align with human perceptions, they could serve as\nstandardized evaluation tools, reducing the dependency on surveys. Our results\nindicate that while current metrics capture some aspects of robot navigation\nbehavior, important subjective factors remain insufficiently represented and\nnew metrics are necessary."}

At the\nsame time, the currently dominant deep learning methods are fundamentally\nblack-box systems that lack explanations for their inferences, significantly\nlimiting their trustworthiness and adoption. Explainable AI (XAI) methods aim\nto overcome this challenge by providing explanations of the models' decision\nprocess. Such methods are often proposed and developed by engineers and\nscientists with a predominantly technical background and incorporate their\nassumptions about the existence, validity, and explanatory utility of different\nconceivable explanatory mechanisms. However, the basic concept of an\nexplanation -- what it is, whether we can know it, whether it is absolute or\nrelative -- is far from trivial and has been the subject of deep philosophical\ndebate for millennia. As we point out here, the assumptions incorporated into\ndifferent XAI methods are not harmless and have important consequences for the\nvalidity and interpretation of AI explanations in different domains.

Within this framework, we evaluate five RL\nalgorithms: DQN, QR-DQN, A2C, PPO, and TRPO under multiple scenarios of varying\ncomplexity. The results reveal distinct performance gaps with increasing\ncomplexity, underscoring the importance of algorithm choice and problem\nformulation for CSPP. Overall, this paper benchmarks multiple RL methods for\nCSPP while providing a reusable Gym environment with crane scheduling, thus\noffering a foundation for future research and practical deployment in maritime\nlogistics."}

To address the challenges posed by noisy, real-world data, we allow\nfor controlled violations of the stability condition, focusing on maintaining\nhigh confidence in the stability certification process. Our results demonstrate\nthat this framework can provide data-driven stability guarantees, offering a\nrobust method for certifying the safety of robotic systems in dynamic,\nreal-world environments. This approach works without access to the internal\ncontrol algorithms, making it applicable even in situations where system\nbehavior is opaque or proprietary. The tool for learning the stability proof is\nopen-sourced by this research: https://github.com/HansOersted/stability."}

Additionally, AI CSAM may serve as a new or enhanced pathway into\noffending by lowering barriers to engagement, desensitizing users to\nprogressively extreme content, and undermining protective factors for\nindividuals with a sexual interest in children. This paper provides a primer on\nsome key technologies, critically examines the harms associated with AI CSAM,\nand cautions against claims that it may function as a harm reduction tool,\nemphasizing how some appeals to harmlessness obscure its real risks and may\ncontribute to inertia in ecosystem responses."}

Recently, radar technologies, such as ultra-wideband (UWB) have\nemerged as potential alternatives due to their ability to see through adverse\nenvironmental conditions (e.g. dust, smoke and rain). However, due to the small\napertures with low directivity, the UWB radars cannot reconstruct a detailed\nimage of its field of view (FOV) using a single scan. Hence, a virtual large\naperture is synthesized by moving the radar along a mobile robot path. The\nresulting synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image is a high-definition\nrepresentation of the surrounding environment. Hence, this paper proposes a\npipeline for mobile robots to incorporate UWB radar-based SAR imaging to map an\nunknown environment. Finally, we evaluated the performance of classical feature\ndetectors: SIFT, SURF, BRISK, AKAZE and ORB to identify loop closures using UWB\nSAR images.

At the\nsame time, the currently dominant deep learning methods are fundamentally\nblack-box systems that lack explanations for their inferences, significantly\nlimiting their trustworthiness and adoption. Explainable AI (XAI) methods aim\nto overcome this challenge by providing explanations of the models' decision\nprocess. Such methods are often proposed and developed by engineers and\nscientists with a predominantly technical background and incorporate their\nassumptions about the existence, validity, and explanatory utility of different\nconceivable explanatory mechanisms. However, the basic concept of an\nexplanation -- what it is, whether we can know it, whether it is absolute or\nrelative -- is far from trivial and has been the subject of deep philosophical\ndebate for millennia. As we point out here, the assumptions incorporated into\ndifferent XAI methods are not harmless and have important consequences for the\nvalidity and interpretation of AI explanations in different domains. We\ninvestigate ontological and epistemological assumptions in explainability\nmethods when they are applied to AI systems, meaning the assumptions we make\nabout the existence of explanations and our ability to gain knowledge about\nthose explanations. Our analysis shows how seemingly small technical changes to\nan XAI method may correspond to important differences in the underlying\nassumptions about explanations. We furthermore highlight the risks of ignoring\nthe underlying onto-epistemological paradigm when choosing an XAI method for a\ngiven application, and we discuss how to select and adapt appropriate XAI\nmethods for different domains of application."}

VLMFP unleashes multiple levels of\ngeneralizability: The same generated PDDL domain file works for all the\ndifferent instances under the same problem, and VLMs generalize to different\nproblems with varied appearances and rules. We evaluate VLMFP with 6 grid-world\ndomains and test its generalization to unseen instances, appearance, and game\nrules. On average, SimVLM accurately describes 95.5%, 82.6% of scenarios,\nsimulates 85.5%, 87.8% of action sequence, and judges 82.4%, 85.6% goal\nreaching for seen and unseen appearances, respectively. With the guidance of\nSimVLM, VLMFP can generate PDDL files to reach 70.0%, 54.1% valid plans for\nunseen instances in seen and unseen appearances, respectively.

However, current\nsystems struggle with complex datasets containing multiple files and iterative\nrefinement. Existing approaches, including simple single- or multi-agent\nsystems, often oversimplify the task, focusing on initial query parsing while\nfailing to robustly manage data complexity, code errors, or final visualization\nquality. In this paper, we reframe this challenge as a collaborative\nmulti-agent problem. We introduce CoDA, a multi-agent system that employs\nspecialized LLM agents for metadata analysis, task planning, code generation,\nand self-reflection. We formalize this pipeline, demonstrating how\nmetadata-focused analysis bypasses token limits and quality-driven refinement\nensures robustness. Extensive evaluations show CoDA achieves substantial gains\nin the overall score, outperforming competitive baselines by up to 41.5%. This\nwork demonstrates that the future of visualization automation lies not in\nisolated code generation but in integrated, collaborative agentic workflows."}

While there are some theoretical and primary\nempirical results showing the advantages of latent reasoning with looped\ntransformers or continuous chain-of-thoughts, continuous diffusion models\ntypically underperform their discrete counterparts. In this paper, we argue\nthat diffusion language models do not necessarily need to be in the discrete\nspace. In particular, we prove that continuous diffusion models have stronger\nexpressivity than discrete diffusions and looped transformers. We attribute the\ncontradiction between the theoretical expressiveness and empirical performance\nto their practical trainability: while continuous diffusion provides\nintermediate supervision that looped transformers lack, they introduce\nadditional difficulty decoding tokens into the discrete token space from the\ncontinuous representation space. We therefore propose Coevolutionary Continuous\nDiscrete Diffusion (CCDD), which defines a joint multimodal diffusion process\non the union of a continuous representation space and a discrete token space,\nleveraging a single model to simultaneously denoise in the joint space. By\ncombining two modalities, CCDD is expressive with rich semantics in the latent\nspace, as well as good trainability and sample quality with the help of\nexplicit discrete tokens. We also propose effective architectures and advanced\ntraining/sampling techniques for CCDD, which reveals strong empirical\nperformance in extensive language modeling experiments on real-world tasks."}

Admission\nrates fluctuate over time due to temporal factors, and length of stay (LOS)\ndistributions vary with patient heterogeneity, hospital location, case mix, and\nclinical practices. Common planning approaches rely on steady-state queueing\nmodels or heuristic rules that assume fixed parameters, but these methods often\nfall short in capturing real-world occupancy dynamics. One widely used example\nis the 85\\% occupancy rule, which recommends maintaining average utilization\nbelow this level to ensure responsiveness; however, this rule is based on\nstationary assumptions and may be unreliable when applied to time-varying\nsystems. Our analysis shows that even when long-run utilization targets are\nmet, day-to-day occupancy frequently exceeds 100\\% capacity.\n  We propose a data-driven framework for estimating ICU bed occupancy using an\n$M_t/G_t/\\infty$ queueing model, which incorporates time-varying arrival rates\nand empirically estimated LOS distributions. The framework combines statistical\ndecomposition and parametric distribution fitting to capture temporal patterns\nin ICU admissions and LOS. We apply it to multi-year data from neonatal ICUs\n(NICUs) in Calgary as a case study. Several capacity planning scenarios are\nevaluated, including average-based thresholds and surge estimates from Poisson\noverflow approximations. Results demonstrate the inadequacy of static\nheuristics in environments with fluctuating demand and highlight the importance\nof modeling LOS variability when estimating bed needs. Although the case study\nfocuses on NICUs, the methodology generalizes to other ICU settings and\nprovides interpretable, data-informed support for healthcare systems facing\nrising demand and limited capacity."}

Detecting and characterizing the astronomical objects in these images\nis a fundamental task in astronomy -- and a challenging one, as most of these\nobjects are faint and many visually overlap with other objects. We propose an\namortized variational inference procedure to solve this instance of\nsmall-object detection. Our key innovation is a family of spatially\nautoregressive variational distributions that partition and order the latent\nspace according to a $K$-color checkerboard pattern. By construction, the\nconditional independencies of this variational family mirror those of the\nposterior distribution. We fit the variational distribution, which is\nparameterized by a convolutional neural network, using neural posterior\nestimation (NPE) to minimize an expectation of the forward KL divergence. Using\nimages from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, our method achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance. We further demonstrate that the proposed autoregressive structure\ngreatly improves posterior calibration."}
