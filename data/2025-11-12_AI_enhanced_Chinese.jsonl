However, to unlock such multimodal potential, robots need to learn the correlations between an object's visual appearance and the sound it generates when they interact with it. Such an active sensorimotor experience requires new interaction capabilities, representations, and exploration methods to guide the robot in efficiently building increasingly rich audiovisual knowledge. In this work, we present CAVER, a novel robot that builds and utilizes rich audiovisual representations of objects. CAVER includes three novel contributions: 1) a novel 3D printed end-effector, attachable to parallel grippers, that excites objects' audio responses, 2) an audiovisual representation that combines local and global appearance information with sound features, and 3) an exploration algorithm that uses and builds the audiovisual representation in a curiosity-driven manner that prioritizes interacting with high uncertainty objects to obtain good coverage of surprising audio with fewer interactions. We demonstrate that CAVER builds rich representations in different scenarios more efficiently than several exploration baselines, and that the learned audiovisual representation leads to significant improvements in material classification and the imitation of audio-only human demonstrations. https://caver-bot.github.io/", "AI": {"tldr": "CAVER\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u672b\u7aef\u6267\u884c\u5668\u3001\u89c6\u542c\u8868\u5f81\u548c\u63a2\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u9ad8\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u7269\u4f53\u5916\u89c2\u4e0e\u58f0\u97f3\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6750\u6599\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u97f3\u9891\u6f14\u793a\u6a21\u4eff\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u89c6\u542c\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u5f00\u8f9f\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u5982\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6750\u6599\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u4ec5\u51ed\u97f3\u9891\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u6f14\u793a\u6a21\u4eff\u3002\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u5b66\u4e60\u7269\u4f53\u89c6\u89c9\u5916\u89c2\u4e0e\u4ea4\u4e92\u4ea7\u751f\u58f0\u97f3\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "method": "1) 3D\u6253\u5370\u672b\u7aef\u6267\u884c\u5668\u6fc0\u53d1\u7269\u4f53\u97f3\u9891\u54cd\u5e94\uff1b2) \u7ed3\u5408\u5c40\u90e8\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u5916\u89c2\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0e\u58f0\u97f3\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u89c6\u542c\u8868\u5f81\uff1b3) \u597d\u5947\u5fc3\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f18\u5148\u4e0e\u9ad8\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7269\u4f53\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002", "result": "CAVER\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u6bd4\u591a\u4e2a\u63a2\u7d22\u57fa\u7ebf\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u6784\u5efa\u4e30\u5bcc\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u89c6\u542c\u8868\u5f81\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u6750\u6599\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u97f3\u9891\u6f14\u793a\u6a21\u4eff\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "CAVER\u7cfb\u7edf\u6210\u529f\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3b\u52a8\u4ea4\u4e92\u5b66\u4e60\u89c6\u542c\u5173\u8054\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Yet most robot learning algorithms remain blind to time. We introduce time-aware policy learning, a reinforcement learning framework that enables robots to explicitly perceive and reason with time as a first-class variable. The framework augments conventional reinforcement policies with two complementary temporal signals, the remaining time and a time ratio, which allow a single policy to modulate its behavior continuously from rapid and dynamic to cautious and precise execution. By jointly optimizing punctuality and stability, the robot learns to balance efficiency, robustness, resiliency, and punctuality without re-training or reward adjustment. Across diverse manipulation domains from long-horizon pick and place, to granular-media pouring, articulated-object handling, and multi-agent object delivery, the time-aware policy produces adaptive behaviors that outperform standard reinforcement learning baselines by up to 48% in efficiency, 8 times more robust in sim-to-real transfer, and 90% in acoustic quietness while maintaining near-perfect success rates. Explicit temporal reasoning further enables real-time human-in-the-loop control and multi-agent coordination, allowing robots to recover from disturbances, re-synchronize after delays, and align motion tempo with human intent. By treating time not as a constraint but as a controllable dimension of behavior, time-aware policy learning provides a unified foundation for efficient, robust, resilient, and human-aligned robot autonomy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u80fd\u591f\u5c06\u65f6\u95f4\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9996\u8981\u53d8\u91cf\u8fdb\u884c\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5269\u4f59\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u6bd4\u4f8b\u4e24\u4e2a\u65f6\u95f4\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u8ba9\u5355\u4e00\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5feb\u901f\u52a8\u6001\u6267\u884c\u548c\u8c28\u614e\u7cbe\u786e\u6267\u884c\u4e4b\u95f4\u8fde\u7eed\u8c03\u8282\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u591a\u6570\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u5bf9\u65f6\u95f4\u662f\u76f2\u76ee\u7684\uff0c\u800c\u65f6\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u662f\u52a8\u7269\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u667a\u80fd\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u6307\u5bfc\u7740\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u6392\u5e8f\u3001\u8282\u594f\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u4f20\u7edf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u589e\u52a0\u5269\u4f59\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u6bd4\u4f8b\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u51c6\u65f6\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u8c03\u6574\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5e73\u8861\u6548\u7387\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3001\u5f39\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u65f6\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u64cd\u4f5c\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\uff0c\u65f6\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u7b56\u7565\u76f8\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u7ebf\u5728\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe48%\uff0csim-to-real\u8fc1\u79fb\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u63d0\u9ad88\u500d\uff0c\u58f0\u5b66\u5b89\u9759\u5ea6\u63d0\u534790%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u63a5\u8fd1\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u65f6\u95f4\u89c6\u4e3a\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u7ef4\u5ea6\u800c\u975e\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u65f6\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u5f39\u6027\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Existing methods typically build networks on top of 2D visual backbones and depend heavily on labeled data for training, which is often scarce in real-world scenarios, causing a sim-to-real gap. Moreover, these approaches reduce the 3D-based problem to 2D domain, neglecting the 3D priors. To address these, we propose Robot Topological Alignment Graph (RoboTAG), which incorporates a 3D branch to inject 3D priors while enabling co-evolution of the 2D and 3D representations, alleviating the reliance on labels. Specifically, the RoboTAG consists of a 3D branch and a 2D branch, where nodes represent the states of the camera and robot system, and edges capture the dependencies between these variables or denote alignments between them.

However, ensuring safe, fair, and reliable participation remains a persistent challenge. Traditional polling methods have seen a notable decline in engagement over recent decades, raising concerns about the credibility of collected data. Meanwhile, social and peer-to-peer networks have become increasingly widespread, but data from these platforms can suffer from credibility issues due to fraudulent or ineligible participation. In this paper, we explore how social interactions can help restore credibility in crowdsourced data collected over social networks. We present an empirical study to detect ineligible participation in a polling task through AI-based graph analysis of social interactions among imperfect participants composed of honest and dishonest actors. Our approach focuses solely on the structure of social interaction graphs, without relying on the content being shared. We simulate different levels and types of dishonest behavior among participants who attempt to propagate the task within their social networks. We conduct experiments on real-world social network datasets, using different eligibility criteria and modeling diverse participation patterns. Although structural differences in social interaction graphs introduce some performance variability, our study achieves promising results in detecting ineligibility across diverse social and behavioral profiles, with accuracy exceeding 90% in some configurations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8eAI\u7684\u793e\u4ea4\u4e92\u52a8\u56fe\u5206\u6790\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u4f17\u5305\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u5408\u683c\u53c2\u4e0e\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u793e\u4ea4\u4e92\u52a8\u7ed3\u6784\u800c\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u5171\u4eab\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u793e\u4ea4\u7f51\u7edc\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u67d0\u4e9b\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8d85\u8fc790%\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f17\u5305\u6570\u636e\u5728\u793e\u4f1a\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u5e7f\u6cdb\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u6295\u7968\u65b9\u6cd5\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u793e\u4ea4\u7f51\u7edc\u6570\u636e\u5b58\u5728\u6b3a\u8bc8\u6216\u4e0d\u5408\u683c\u53c2\u4e0e\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6062\u590d\u4f17\u5305\u6570\u636e\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528AI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u56fe\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ec5\u5206\u6790\u793e\u4ea4\u4e92\u52a8\u56fe\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u4e0d\u8bda\u5b9e\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u793e\u4ea4\u7f51\u7edc\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u793e\u4ea4\u4e92\u52a8\u56fe\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5dee\u5f02\u5e26\u6765\u6027\u80fd\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0d\u5408\u683c\u53c2\u4e0e\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u6709\u5e0c\u671b\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u67d0\u4e9b\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8d85\u8fc790%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u793e\u4ea4\u4e92\u52a8\u5206\u6790\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u4f17\u5305\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u5408\u683c\u53c2\u4e0e\uff0c\u4e3a\u6062\u590d\u793e\u4ea4\u7f51\u7edc\u4f17\u5305\u6570\u636e\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Specifically, we jointly address two questions (Q1) Survivability: following a disturbance and the subsequent primary frequency response, can the system settle into a healthy steady state (feasible with an acceptable frequency deviation $\u0394f$)? (Q2) Dominant Vulnerability: if found unstable, what critical vulnerabilities create instability and/or full collapse? To address these questions, we first augment steady-state power flow states to include frequency-dependent governor relationships (i.e., governor power flow). Afterwards, we propose a frequency-aware sparse optimization that finds the minimal set of bus locations with measurable compensations (corrective actions) to enforce power balance and maintain frequency within predefined/acceptable bounds. We evaluate our method on standard transmission systems to empirically validate its ability to localize dominant sources of vulnerabilities. For a 1354-bus large system, our method detects compensations to only four buses under N-1 generation outage (3424.8 MW) while enforcing a maximum allowable steady-state frequency drop of 0.06 Hz (otherwise, frequency drops by nearly 0.08 Hz). We further validate the scalability of our method, requiring less than four minutes to obtain sparse solutions for the 1354-bus system.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u4ece\u7a33\u6001\u89d2\u5ea6\u4e3b\u52a8\u8bca\u65ad\u548c\u7ba1\u7406\u9891\u7387\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u77ac\u6001\u5efa\u6a21\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u9891\u7387\u611f\u77e5\u7a00\u758f\u4f18\u5316\u627e\u5230\u6700\u5c0f\u8865\u507f\u96c6\u6765\u7ef4\u6301\u9891\u7387\u5728\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u77ac\u6001\u5efa\u6a21\u5206\u6790\u9891\u7387\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u4ece\u7a33\u6001\u89d2\u5ea6\u4e3b\u52a8\u8bca\u65ad\u9891\u7387\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u6270\u52a8\u540e\u80fd\u5426\u8fdb\u5165\u5065\u5eb7\u7a33\u6001\u4ee5\u53ca\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u8106\u5f31\u70b9\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u6269\u5c55\u7a33\u6001\u6f6e\u6d41\u72b6\u6001\u4ee5\u5305\u542b\u9891\u7387\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u8c03\u901f\u5668\u5173\u7cfb\uff08\u8c03\u901f\u5668\u6f6e\u6d41\uff09\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u63d0\u51fa\u9891\u7387\u611f\u77e5\u7a00\u758f\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5bfb\u627e\u6700\u5c0f\u603b\u7ebf\u4f4d\u7f6e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u8865\u507f\u4ee5\u7ef4\u6301\u529f\u7387\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u9891\u7387\u5728\u9884\u5b9a\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u3002", "result": "\u57281354\u8282\u70b9\u5927\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u65b9\u6cd5\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u4ec5\u9700\u5bf94\u4e2a\u603b\u7ebf\u8fdb\u884c\u8865\u507f\u5373\u53ef\u5e94\u5bf9N-1\u53d1\u7535\u4e2d\u65ad\uff083424.8 MW\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u7a33\u6001\u9891\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\u9650\u5236\u57280.06 Hz\u5185\uff08\u5426\u5219\u4f1a\u4e0b\u964d\u8fd10.08 Hz\uff09\u3002\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u6c42\u89e31354\u8282\u70b9\u7cfb\u7edf\u7a00\u758f\u89e3\u4ec5\u9700\u4e0d\u52304\u5206\u949f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u7cfb\u7edf\u9891\u7387\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u4e3b\u5bfc\u8106\u5f31\u6e90\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u7a33\u6001\u9891\u7387\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u9891\u7387\u98ce\u9669\u7ba1\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Micro-credentials are commonly described as mini qualifications or digital badges that certify an individual competency in a specific skill or cluster of skills. Being different from traditional academic credentials in both their granularity and focus, micro-credentials represent a new and exciting topic that is rapidly gaining popularity all around the world both within higher educational institutions, such as public and private universities, as well as within other education providers, such as non-governmental organizations and SMEs. The popularity of micro-credentials has been further enhanced by the recent COVID-19 pandemic which caused digital surge in higher education leading to many rapid technological innovations and changes that were unthinkable before. The rising interest in micro-credentialing can be best demonstrated by the increase of the number of scientific publications on this topic from just 1 in 1992 to 165 in 2024. The paper employs a comprehensive bibliometric network analysis using the terms micro-credentials based on a sample of 608 selected publications indexed in the Scopus database.

This paper shows that MP theory can also be formulated in a mathematically equivalent way using vectorial marginal products--which however conflicts with the above-mentioned ``distributive shares'' picture. Vectorial MP theory also facilitates the presentation of modern treatment of the labor theory of property which on the descriptive side is based on the fact that, contrary to the distributive shares picture, one legal party gets the production vector consisting of 100 percent of the liabilities for the used-up inputs and 100 percent of the produced outputs in a productive opportunity. On the normative side, the labor theory of property is just the application of the usual juridical norm of imputation to the question of property appropriation.\n  Keywords: marginal productivity theory, property theory, imputation of responsibility, vectorial marginal products\n  JEL Classification]{D2, D3, D63, P14", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8fb9\u9645\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u53ef\u4ee5\u7528\u5411\u91cf\u8fb9\u9645\u4ea7\u54c1\u6765\u8868\u8ff0\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u6807\u91cf\u8fb9\u9645\u4ea7\u54c1\u7406\u8bba\u5728\u5206\u914d\u4efd\u989d\u89c2\u70b9\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u52b3\u52a8\u8d22\u4ea7\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u73b0\u4ee3\u5904\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u63ed\u793a\u4f20\u7edf\u8fb9\u9645\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u57fa\u4e8e\u6807\u91cf\u8fb9\u9645\u4ea7\u54c1\u7684\u5206\u914d\u4efd\u989d\u89c2\u70b9\u4e0e\u5411\u91cf\u8fb9\u9645\u4ea7\u54c1\u8868\u8ff0\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u4e3a\u52b3\u52a8\u8d22\u4ea7\u7406\u8bba\u63d0\u4f9b\u6570\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u8fb9\u9645\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u4ece\u6807\u91cf\u8fb9\u9645\u4ea7\u54c1\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u5411\u91cf\u8fb9\u9645\u4ea7\u54c1\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u8fd9\u79cd\u8868\u8ff0\u5bf9\u5206\u914d\u4efd\u989d\u89c2\u70b9\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u52b3\u52a8\u8d22\u4ea7\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "result": "\u5411\u91cf\u8fb9\u9645\u4ea7\u54c1\u7406\u8bba\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u4e0a\u7b49\u540c\u4e8e\u6807\u91cf\u8fb9\u9645\u4ea7\u54c1\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5206\u914d\u4efd\u989d\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u4e0a\u4e0e\u4e4b\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4e86\u52b3\u52a8\u8d22\u4ea7\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u4e00\u65b9\u627f\u62c5\u5168\u90e8\u6295\u5165\u8d23\u4efb\u5e76\u83b7\u5f97\u5168\u90e8\u4ea7\u51fa\u7684\u89c2\u70b9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5411\u91cf\u8fb9\u9645\u4ea7\u54c1\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u52b3\u52a8\u8d22\u4ea7\u7406\u8bba\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5408\u9002\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u65b0\u53e4\u5178\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u4e2d\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5206\u914d\u4efd\u989d\u4f26\u7406\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5c06\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5f52\u8d23\u89c4\u8303\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u8d22\u4ea7\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

The emergence of large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and Claude, has expanded this integration even further. Because of LLM versatility and ease of use through APIs, these larger models are often utilised even though smaller, custom models can be used instead. In this paper, LLMs and small discriminative models are integrated into a Mendix application to detect Covid-19 in chest X-rays. These discriminative models are also used to provide knowledge bases for LLMs to improve accuracy. This provides a benchmark study of 14 different model configurations for comparison of accuracy and environmental impact. The findings indicated that while smaller models reduced the carbon footprint of the application, the output was biased towards a positive diagnosis and the output probabilities were lacking confidence. Meanwhile, restricting LLMs to only give probabilistic output caused poor performance in both accuracy and carbon footprint, demonstrating the risk of using LLMs as a universal AI solution. While using the smaller LLM GPT-4.1-Nano reduced the carbon footprint by 94.2% compared to the larger models, this was still disproportionate to the discriminative models; the most efficient solution was the Covid-Net model. Although it had a larger carbon footprint than other small models, its carbon footprint was 99.9% less than when using GPT-4.5-Preview, whilst achieving an accuracy of 95.5%, the highest of all models examined.

Because of this, artificial intelligence (AI) models used to assist such decisions are frequently trained with asymmetric loss functions that incorporate human decision-makers' trade-offs between false positives and false negatives. In two focal applications, we show that this standard alignment practice can backfire. In both cases, it would be better to train the machine learning model with a loss function that ignores the human's objective and then adjust predictions ex post according to that objective. We rationalize this result using an economic model of incentive design with endogenous information acquisition. The key insight from our theoretical framework is that machine classifiers perform not one but two incentivized tasks: choosing how to classify and learning how to classify. We show that while the adjustments engineers use correctly incentivize choosing, they can simultaneously reduce the incentives to learn. Our formal treatment of the problem reveals that methods embraced for their intuitive appeal can in fact misalign human and machine objectives in predictable ways.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u6210\u672c\u7684\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\uff0c\u6807\u51c6\u505a\u6cd5\u662f\u4f7f\u7528\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u8bad\u7ec3AI\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u5339\u914d\u4eba\u7c7b\u51b3\u7b56\u8005\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002\u4f46\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd9\u79cd\u505a\u6cd5\u53ef\u80fd\u9002\u5f97\u5176\u53cd\uff0c\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u7528\u5bf9\u79f0\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u6839\u636e\u4eba\u7c7b\u76ee\u6807\u4e8b\u540e\u8c03\u6574\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u6210\u672c\u662f\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u7684\uff08\u5982\u533b\u7597\u8bca\u65ad\uff09\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u505a\u6cd5\u662f\u7528\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u8bad\u7ec3AI\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u5339\u914d\u4eba\u7c7b\u51b3\u7b56\u8005\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u53cd\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6fc0\u52b1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u5185\u751f\u4fe1\u606f\u83b7\u53d6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c06\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u89c6\u4e3a\u6267\u884c\u4e24\u4e2a\u6fc0\u52b1\u4efb\u52a1\uff1a\u5206\u7c7b\u51b3\u7b56\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u8c03\u6574\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6b63\u786e\u6fc0\u52b1\u5206\u7c7b\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u5b66\u4e60\u6fc0\u52b1\u3002\u6807\u51c6\u5bf9\u9f50\u5b9e\u8df5\u53ef\u80fd\u4ee5\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u5bfc\u81f4\u4eba\u7c7b\u548c\u673a\u5668\u76ee\u6807\u9519\u4f4d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u6210\u672c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\uff0c\u7528\u5bf9\u79f0\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7136\u540e\u4e8b\u540e\u8c03\u6574\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u6bd4\u76f4\u63a5\u4f7f\u7528\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u679c\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u540e\u8005\u53ef\u80fd\u524a\u5f31\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u6fc0\u52b1\u3002"}}

The FPP has been applied in various fields, such as modeling occurrences of extratropical cyclones in meteorology and solar flares in physics. We propose a new estimation method for the parameters of the FPP, based on minimizing the distance between the empirical and the theoretical distribution at selected quantiles. We conduct an extensive simulation study to evaluate the advantages and limitations of the new estimation method and to compare it with several competing estimators, some of which have not yet been examined in the Mittag-Leffler setting. To enhance the applicability of the FPP in real-world scenarios, particularly in meteorology, we propose a method for incorporating seasonality into the FPP through distance-based weighting.

Compact models are essential for analyzing the circuit and system-level performance of experimental RRAM devices. However, most existing RRAM compact models rely on multiple fitting parameters to reproduce the device I-V characteristics, and in most cases, as the parameters are not directly related to measurable quantities, their extraction requires extensive manual tuning, making the process time-consuming and limiting adaptability across different devices. This work presents an automated framework for extracting the fitting parameters of the widely used Stanford RRAM model directly from the device I-V characteristics. The framework employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on a synthetic dataset to generate initial parameter estimates, which are then refined through three heuristic optimization blocks that minimize errors via adaptive binary search in the parameter space. We evaluated the framework using four key NVM metrics: set voltage, reset voltage, hysteresis loop area, and low resistance state (LRS) slope.

Aimed at achieving a similar level of capability in large language models (LLMs) for embodied intelligence, data quality plays a crucial role in training a foundational model with diverse robot skills. In this study, we investigate the collection of data for manipulation tasks using teleoperation devices. Different devices yield varying effects when paired with corresponding controller strategies, including position-based inverse kinematics (IK) control, torque-based inverse dynamics (ID) control, and optimization-based compliance control. In this paper, we develop a teleoperation pipeline that is compatible with different teleoperation devices and manipulator controllers. Within the pipeline, we construct the optimal QP formulation with the dynamic nullspace and the impedance tracking as the novel optimal controller to achieve compliant pose tracking and singularity avoidance. Regarding the optimal controller, it adaptively adjusts the weights assignment depending on the robot joint manipulability that reflects the state of joint configuration for the pose tracking in the form of impedance control and singularity avoidance with nullspace tracking. Analysis of quantitative experimental results suggests the quality of the teleoperated trajectory data, including tracking error, occurrence of singularity, and the smoothness of the joints' trajectory, with different combinations of teleoperation interface and the motion controller.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u517c\u5bb9\u4e0d\u540c\u9065\u64cd\u4f5c\u8bbe\u5907\u548c\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7684\u9065\u64cd\u4f5c\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u96f6\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u963b\u6297\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u987a\u5e94\u6027\u59ff\u6001\u8ddf\u8e2a\u548c\u5947\u5f02\u6027\u907f\u514d\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f7f\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u5907\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4eba\u7c7b\u5927\u8111\u7684\u667a\u80fd\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ecf\u9a8c\u81ea\u4e3b\u83b7\u53d6\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u517c\u5bb9\u4e0d\u540c\u9065\u64cd\u4f5c\u8bbe\u5907\u548c\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7684\u9065\u64cd\u4f5c\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u96f6\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u963b\u6297\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7684\u6700\u4f18QP\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5173\u8282\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u6574\u6743\u91cd\u5206\u914d\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u9065\u64cd\u4f5c\u8f68\u8ff9\u6570\u636e\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8ddf\u8e2a\u8bef\u5dee\u3001\u5947\u5f02\u6027\u53d1\u751f\u60c5\u51b5\u4ee5\u53ca\u5173\u8282\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u5e73\u6ed1\u5ea6\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u9065\u64cd\u4f5c\u63a5\u53e3\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u9065\u64cd\u4f5c\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u548c\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u9065\u64cd\u4f5c\u6570\u636e\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5177\u8eab\u667a\u80fd\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

A range of approaches have been explored, with graph-based models standing out for their ability to capture structural patterns in transaction networks. However, these approaches face two main challenges: label noise and label scarcity, leading to suboptimal performance and limited generalization. To address these, we propose HiLoMix, a graph-based learning framework specifically designed for mixing address association. First, we construct the Heterogeneous Attributed Mixing Interaction Graph (HAMIG) to enrich the topological structure. Second, we introduce frequency-aware graph contrastive learning that captures complementary structural signals from high- and low-frequency graph views. Third, we employ weak supervised learning that assigns confidence-based weighting to noisy labels. Then, we jointly train high-pass and low-pass GNNs using both unsupervised contrastive signals and confidence-based supervision to learn robust node representations. Finally, we adopt a stacking framework to fuse predictions from multiple heterogeneous models, further improving generalization and robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that HiLoMix outperforms existing methods in mixing address association.", "AI": {"tldr": "HiLoMix\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u5730\u5740\u5173\u8054\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u5f02\u6784\u56fe\u3001\u9891\u7387\u611f\u77e5\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u878d\u5408\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u6807\u7b7e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df7\u5408\u670d\u52a1\u88ab\u6076\u610f\u884c\u4e3a\u8005\u7528\u4e8e\u975e\u6cd5\u4ea4\u6613\uff0c\u6df7\u5408\u5730\u5740\u5173\u8054\u6210\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u7814\u7a76\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u6a21\u578b\u9762\u4e34\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u6807\u7b7e\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4f73\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "1) \u6784\u5efa\u5f02\u6784\u5c5e\u6027\u6df7\u5408\u4ea4\u4e92\u56fe(HAMIG)\u4e30\u5bcc\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b2) \u5f15\u5165\u9891\u7387\u611f\u77e5\u56fe\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4ece\u9ad8\u3001\u4f4e\u9891\u56fe\u89c6\u89d2\u6355\u83b7\u4e92\u8865\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1b3) \u91c7\u7528\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u4e3a\u566a\u58f0\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u914d\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6743\u91cd\uff1b4) \u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u9ad8\u901a\u548c\u4f4e\u901aGNN\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4fe1\u53f7\u548c\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u76d1\u7763\uff1b5) \u91c7\u7528\u5806\u53e0\u6846\u67b6\u878d\u5408\u591a\u4e2a\u5f02\u6784\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660eHiLoMix\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u5730\u5740\u5173\u8054\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "HiLoMix\u901a\u8fc7\u7efc\u5408\u89e3\u51b3\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u6807\u7b7e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6df7\u5408\u5730\u5740\u5173\u8054\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

The system is designed to translate battlefield complexity and the commander's intent into executable action plans. To this end, ARGUS employs a processing pipeline that takes as input geospatial terrain data, military intelligence on existing threats and their probable locations, and mission priorities defined by the commander. Through a set of integrated modules, the framework processes this information to generate optimized trajectories that balance mission objectives against the risks posed by threats and terrain characteristics. A fundamental capability of ARGUS is its dynamic nature, which allows it to adapt plans in real-time in response to unforeseen events, reflecting the fluid nature of the modern battlefield. The system's interoperability were validated in a practical exercise with the Portuguese Army, where it was successfully demonstrated that the routes generated by the model can be integrated and utilized by UGV control systems.

Results: (i) among trees, stars maximize worth, leading to weakly fewer equilibrium partitions; (ii) on stars, we derive closed-form effective biases, with a witness-hub marginal effect of adding leaves changing sign at $\u03b4^{\\ast}=0.6$; (iii) for two stars joined by one link, two-star (hub-hub) vs big-star (hub-leaf) precision flips at 8/15 for the same number of nodes; private leaf-leaf conferences are most informative.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u793e\u4ea4\u7f51\u7edc\u56fe\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f53\u8bf4\u8bdd\u8005\u5173\u6ce8\u793e\u4f1a\u5173\u7cfb\u65f6\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u95f4\u63a5\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7Myerson\u503c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4f1a\u8bae\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u7684\u8bae\u4ef7\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5206\u533a\u9608\u503c\u89c4\u5219\u786e\u5b9a\u5747\u8861\u6d88\u606f\u5206\u533a\u6570\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u793e\u4ea4\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u8bed\u8a00\u95f4\u63a5\u6027\u548c\u6c9f\u901a\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u8003\u8651\u793e\u4f1a\u5173\u7cfb\u65f6\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u793e\u4f1a\u5173\u7cfb\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4f1a\u8bae\u662f\u542c\u5230\u6d88\u606f\u7684\u8282\u70b9\u96c6\u5408\u3002\u4f7f\u7528Myerson\u503c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4f1a\u8bae\u9650\u5236\u4ef7\u503c\u4e0b\u7684\u8bae\u4ef7\u80fd\u529b\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u533a\u9608\u503c\u89c4\u5219\u786e\u5b9a\u5747\u8861\u6d88\u606f\u5206\u533a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6811\u72b6\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\uff0c\u661f\u5f62\u7ed3\u6784\u6700\u5927\u5316\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u5747\u8861\u5206\u533a\uff1b\u5728\u661f\u5f62\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f53\u03b4*=0.6\u65f6\uff0c\u6dfb\u52a0\u53f6\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u8fb9\u9645\u6548\u5e94\u6539\u53d8\u7b26\u53f7\uff1b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e24\u4e2a\u661f\u5f62\u8fde\u63a5\uff0c\u57288/15\u5904\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7ffb\u8f6c\uff1b\u79c1\u5bc6\u53f6-\u53f6\u4f1a\u8bae\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u6700\u5927\u3002", "conclusion": "\u793e\u4ea4\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u8bed\u8a00\u95f4\u63a5\u6027\u548c\u6c9f\u901a\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u7279\u5b9a\u7f51\u7edc\u62d3\u6251\uff08\u5982\u661f\u5f62\u7ed3\u6784\uff09\u548c\u8fde\u63a5\u65b9\u5f0f\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5747\u8861\u7ed3\u679c\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u7279\u6027\u3002"}}

The system leverages four specialized agents that work together to generate contextually appropriate educational content. Experimental validation on platforms including Raspberry Pi 4B and NVIDIA Jetson Nano demonstrates significant performance achievements. InkubaLM on Jetson Nano achieved a Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) of 129 ms, an average inter-token latency of 33 ms, and a throughput of 45.2 tokens per second while consuming 8.4 W. On Raspberry Pi 4B, InkubaLM also led with 326 ms TTFT and 15.9 tokens per second at 5.8 W power consumption. The framework consistently delivered high multilingual quality, averaging a BLEU score of 0.688, cultural relevance of 4.4/5, and fluency of 4.2/5 across tested African languages. Through potential partnerships with active community organizations including African Youth & Community Organization (AYCO) and Florida Africa Foundation, this research aims to establish a practical foundation for accessible, localized, and sustainable AI-driven education in resource-constrained environments.

An empirical analysis", "comment": null, "summary": "This paper investigates the heterogeneous effects of military spending news shocks on household income and wealth inequality for a large, panel of advanced and emerging economies. Confirming prior literature, we find that military spending news shocks lead to persistent increases in aggregate output and Total Factor Productivity. Our primary contribution is documenting contrasting distributional impacts. We find that expansionary military spending is associated with a mitigation of income inequality, as income gains are disproportionately larger at the left tail of the distribution, primarily driven by a rise in labour income and employment in industry. Conversely, the shock is found to increase wealth inequality, particularly in high-income countries, by raising the wealth share of the top decile via effects on business asset holdings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u519b\u4e8b\u652f\u51fa\u65b0\u95fb\u51b2\u51fb\u5bf9\u5bb6\u5ead\u6536\u5165\u548c\u8d22\u5bcc\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\u4ea7\u751f\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\uff1a\u7f13\u89e3\u6536\u5165\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\u4f46\u52a0\u5267\u8d22\u5bcc\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u519b\u4e8b\u652f\u51fa\u65b0\u95fb\u51b2\u51fb\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u56fd\u5bb6\u5bb6\u5ead\u6536\u5165\u548c\u8d22\u5bcc\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u732e\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u6548\u5e94\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u7a7a\u767d", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u578b\u9762\u677f\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u53d1\u8fbe\u548c\u65b0\u5174\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4f53\u4e2d\u519b\u4e8b\u652f\u51fa\u65b0\u95fb\u51b2\u51fb\u5bf9\u6536\u5165\u5206\u914d\u548c\u8d22\u5bcc\u5206\u914d\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u5f71\u54cd", "result": "\u519b\u4e8b\u652f\u51fa\u51b2\u51fb\u5bfc\u81f4\u4ea7\u51fa\u548c\u5168\u8981\u7d20\u751f\u4ea7\u7387\u6301\u7eed\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u6536\u5165\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\u7f13\u89e3\uff08\u4f4e\u6536\u5165\u7fa4\u4f53\u83b7\u76ca\u66f4\u591a\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u8d22\u5bcc\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\u52a0\u5267\uff08\u9ad8\u6536\u5165\u7fa4\u4f53\u8d22\u5bcc\u4efd\u989d\u4e0a\u5347\uff09", "conclusion": "\u519b\u4e8b\u652f\u51fa\u6269\u5f20\u5177\u6709\u590d\u6742\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7f13\u89e3\u6536\u5165\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\u4f46\u52a0\u5267\u8d22\u5bcc\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9ad8\u6536\u5165\u56fd\u5bb6"}}

Yet, gender disparity and women's disempowerment continue to hinder access to vaccination services in low- and middle-income countries. In Nigeria, variations in social norms and cultural values shape gender roles, limiting women's autonomy in healthcare decisions and household participation. These constraints contribute to spatial differences in immunization uptake. Using data from four waves of the Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey, we developed two empowerment indices capturing women's participation in household decision-making and their ability to decide on personal healthcare needs. A structured spatiotemporal statistical model was applied to assess how much of the observed vaccination disparities could be attributed to women's empowerment and to predict vaccination outcomes at the third administrative level. We examined five indicators: Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG), zero-dose, complete DPT, MCV-1 (first dose of measles-containing vaccine), and all-basic vaccination coverage. Model validation involved comparing empirical estimates with projections at the second administrative level. Results indicate that empowerment related to household participation and healthcare autonomy generally increases vaccination uptake, though the magnitude of effects varies geographically, particularly among highly empowered women. Despite ongoing national efforts to close immunization gaps, the study highlights the need for context-specific strategies that enhance women's decision-making power and community engagement to reduce regional disparities and improve overall vaccination coverage.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5c3c\u65e5\u5229\u4e9a\u5973\u6027\u8d4b\u6743\u5bf9\u75ab\u82d7\u63a5\u79cd\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5973\u6027\u5728\u5bb6\u5ead\u51b3\u7b56\u548c\u533b\u7597\u81ea\u4e3b\u6743\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u8d4b\u6743\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0e\u75ab\u82d7\u63a5\u79cd\u7387\u5448\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4f46\u6548\u679c\u5b58\u5728\u5730\u7406\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3c\u65e5\u5229\u4e9a\u7684\u6027\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\u548c\u5973\u6027\u8d4b\u6743\u4e0d\u8db3\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u75ab\u82d7\u63a5\u79cd\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u83b7\u53d6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u514d\u75ab\u63a5\u79cd\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u5b58\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5c3c\u65e5\u5229\u4e9a\u4eba\u53e3\u4e0e\u5065\u5eb7\u8c03\u67e5\u56db\u8f6e\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e24\u4e2a\u5973\u6027\u8d4b\u6743\u6307\u6570\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u65f6\u7a7a\u7edf\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u8d4b\u6743\u5bf9\u75ab\u82d7\u63a5\u79cd\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u9884\u6d4b\u7b2c\u4e09\u884c\u653f\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u63a5\u79cd\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4e0e\u5bb6\u5ead\u53c2\u4e0e\u548c\u533b\u7597\u81ea\u4e3b\u6743\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u8d4b\u6743\u603b\u4f53\u4e0a\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u75ab\u82d7\u63a5\u79cd\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u6548\u679c\u5f3a\u5ea6\u56e0\u5730\u533a\u800c\u5f02\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9ad8\u5ea6\u8d4b\u6743\u7684\u5973\u6027\u4e2d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u56fd\u5bb6\u52aa\u529b\u7f29\u5c0f\u514d\u75ab\u63a5\u79cd\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u9700\u5236\u5b9a\u9488\u5bf9\u5177\u4f53\u80cc\u666f\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u5973\u6027\u51b3\u7b56\u6743\u548c\u793e\u533a\u53c2\u4e0e\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u5730\u533a\u5dee\u5f02\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u6574\u4f53\u75ab\u82d7\u63a5\u79cd\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u3002"}}

Within the TAMP context, we are concerned with the mobile manipulation (MoMa) of multiple objects, where it is necessary to interleave actions for navigation and manipulation.\n  In particular, we aim to compute where and how each object should be placed given underspecified goals, such as ``set up dinner table with a fork, knife and plate.'' We leverage the rich common sense knowledge from large language models (LLMs), e.g., about how tableware is organized, to facilitate both task-level and motion-level planning. In addition, we use computer vision methods to learn a strategy for selecting base positions to facilitate MoMa behaviors, where the base position corresponds to the robot's ``footprint'' and orientation in its operating space. Altogether, this article provides a principled TAMP framework for MoMa tasks that accounts for common sense about object rearrangement and is adaptive to novel situations that include many objects that need to be moved. We performed quantitative experiments in both real-world settings and simulated environments. We evaluated the success rate and efficiency in completing long-horizon object rearrangement tasks.

While the rise of large-language models offer new possible opportunities for measuring expressions of human values (e.g., humility or equality) in social media data, there remain both conceptual and practical challenges in operationalizing value expression in social media posts: what value system and operationalization is most applicable, and how do we actually measure them? In this paper, we draw on the Schwartz value system as a broadly encompassing and theoretically grounded set of basic human values, and introduce a framework for measuring Schwartz value expressions in social media posts at scale. We collect 32,370 ground truth value expression annotations from N=1,079 people on 5,211 social media posts representative of real users' feeds. We observe low levels of inter-rater agreement between people, and low agreement between human raters and LLM-based methods. Drawing on theories of interpretivism - that different people will have different subjective experiences of the same situation - we argue that value expression is (partially) in the eye of the beholder.

We present parallel continuous-time and discrete-time designs in which each node runs a local adaptive observer and exchanges information over a directed graph. For both time scales, we establish stability of the network coupling operators, prove boundedness of all internal signals, and show convergence of each node estimate to the source despite model uncertainty and disturbances. We further derive input-to-state stability (ISS) bounds that quantify robustness to bounded process noise. A key distinction is that the discrete-time design uses constant adaptive gains and per-step regressor normalization to handle sampling effects, whereas the continuous-time design does not. A unified Lyapunov framework links local observer dynamics with graph topology. Simulations on star, cyclic, and path networks corroborate the analysis, demonstrating accurate tracking, robustness, and scalability with the number of sensing nodes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5177\u6709\u90e8\u5206\u5df2\u77e5\u6e90\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7f51\u7edc\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4f30\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u79bb\u6563\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u7f51\u7edc\u8026\u5408\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u5185\u90e8\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u6709\u754c\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u8282\u70b9\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u5728\u6e90\u52a8\u6001\u90e8\u5206\u5df2\u77e5\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4f30\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u5904\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5e76\u884c\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u79bb\u6563\u65f6\u95f4\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8282\u70b9\u8fd0\u884c\u672c\u5730\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u89c2\u6d4b\u5668\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u5411\u56fe\u4ea4\u6362\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u79bb\u6563\u65f6\u95f4\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4f7f\u7528\u6052\u5b9a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u589e\u76ca\u548c\u6bcf\u6b65\u56de\u5f52\u5668\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6765\u5904\u7406\u91c7\u6837\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u7f51\u7edc\u8026\u5408\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6240\u6709\u5185\u90e8\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u6709\u754c\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8282\u70b9\u4f30\u8ba1\u6536\u655b\u5230\u6e90\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5e72\u6270\u4e0b\u3002\u8fd8\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u8f93\u5165\u5230\u72b6\u6001\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027(ISS)\u754c\u9650\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u5bf9\u6709\u9650\u8fc7\u7a0b\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7edf\u4e00\u7684Lyapunov\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u672c\u5730\u89c2\u6d4b\u5668\u52a8\u6001\u4e0e\u56fe\u62d3\u6251\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5206\u6790\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u8ddf\u8e2a\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u4e0e\u4f20\u611f\u8282\u70b9\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002"}}

This paper argues that such confident fabrication, what I call the polite liar, is a structural consequence of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Building on Frankfurt's analysis of bullshit as communicative indifference to truth, I show that this pathology is not deception but structural indifference: a reward architecture that optimizes for perceived sincerity over evidential accuracy. Current alignment methods reward models for being helpful, harmless, and polite, but not for being epistemically grounded. As a result, systems learn to maximize user satisfaction rather than truth, performing conversational fluency as a virtue. I analyze this behavior through the lenses of epistemic virtue theory, speech-act philosophy, and cognitive alignment, showing that RLHF produces agents trained to mimic epistemic confidence without access to epistemic justification. The polite liar thus reveals a deeper alignment tension between linguistic cooperation and epistemic integrity.

However, numerous technical reports indicate that purely rule-based reward RL frequently results in poor-quality reasoning chains or inconsistencies between reasoning processes and final answers, particularly when the base model is of smaller scale. During the RL exploration process, models might employ low-quality reasoning chains due to the lack of knowledge, occasionally producing correct answers randomly and receiving rewards based on established rule-based judges. This constrains the potential for resource-limited organizations to conduct direct reinforcement learning training on smaller-scale models. We propose a novel confidence-based reward model tailored for enhancing STEM reasoning capabilities. Unlike conventional approaches, our model penalizes not only incorrect answers but also low-confidence correct responses, thereby promoting more robust and logically consistent reasoning.

Data annotation, once lauded as a democratizing force within the global gig economy, has evolved into a segmented labor market characterized by low wages, limited protections, and unequal access to higher-skilled annotation tasks. Drawing on an exploratory survey of 30 Latin American data annotators, supplemented by qualitative accounts and comparative secondary literature, this study situates female annotators within broader debates in labor economics, including segmentation theory, monopsony power in platform labor, and the reserve army of labor. Findings indicate that women are disproportionately drawn into annotation due to caregiving obligations and political-economic instability in countries such as Venezuela, Colombia, and Peru. Respondents highlight low pay, irregular access to tasks, and lack of benefits as central challenges, while also expressing ambivalence about whether their work is valued relative to male counterparts. By framing annotation as both a gendered survival strategy and a critical input in the global artificial intelligence supply chain, this paper argues for the recognition of annotation as skilled labor and for regulatory interventions that address platform accountability, wage suppression, and regional inequalities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u62c9\u4e01\u7f8e\u6d32\u6570\u636e\u6807\u6ce8\u96f6\u5de5\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u522b\u5206\u5c42\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u5973\u6027\u627f\u62c5\u7684\"\u4e09\u91cd\u8d1f\u62c5\"\uff1a\u65e0\u507f\u7167\u6599\u8d23\u4efb\u3001\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5e73\u53f0\u4e2d\u4ecb\u52b3\u52a8\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6570\u636e\u6807\u6ce8\u66fe\u88ab\u8d5e\u8a89\u4e3a\u5168\u7403\u96f6\u5de5\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4e2d\u7684\u6c11\u4e3b\u5316\u529b\u91cf\uff0c\u4f46\u5df2\u6f14\u53d8\u4e3a\u4f4e\u5de5\u8d44\u3001\u6709\u9650\u4fdd\u62a4\u548c\u6280\u80fd\u4efb\u52a1\u83b7\u53d6\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\u7684\u5206\u5272\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u8ba8\u5973\u6027\u6807\u6ce8\u5458\u5728\u8fd9\u4e00\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5904\u5883\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u8c03\u67e5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5bf930\u540d\u62c9\u4e01\u7f8e\u6d32\u6570\u636e\u6807\u6ce8\u5458\u8fdb\u884c\u8c03\u67e5\uff0c\u8f85\u4ee5\u5b9a\u6027\u63cf\u8ff0\u548c\u6bd4\u8f83\u6027\u4e8c\u624b\u6587\u732e\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5973\u6027\u56e0\u7167\u6599\u4e49\u52a1\u548c\u653f\u6cbb\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u800c\u88ab\u4e0d\u6210\u6bd4\u4f8b\u5730\u5438\u5f15\u5230\u6807\u6ce8\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\uff0c\u9762\u4e34\u4f4e\u5de5\u8d44\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u83b7\u53d6\u4e0d\u89c4\u5f8b\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u798f\u5229\u7b49\u4e3b\u8981\u6311\u6218\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e94\u5c06\u6807\u6ce8\u89c6\u4e3a\u719f\u7ec3\u52b3\u52a8\uff0c\u5e76\u547c\u5401\u76d1\u7ba1\u5e72\u9884\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u5e73\u53f0\u8d23\u4efb\u3001\u5de5\u8d44\u538b\u5236\u548c\u533a\u57df\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Videos, including those of humans or teleoperated robots, capture rich physical interactions. However, most of them lack labeled actions, which limits their use in robot learning. We present Video Prediction for Robot Actions (ViPRA), a simple pretraining-finetuning framework that learns continuous robot control from these actionless videos. Instead of directly predicting actions, we train a video-language model to predict both future visual observations and motion-centric latent actions, which serve as intermediate representations of scene dynamics. We train these latent actions using perceptual losses and optical flow consistency to ensure they reflect physically grounded behavior. For downstream control, we introduce a chunked flow matching decoder that maps latent actions to robot-specific continuous action sequences, using only 100 to 200 teleoperated demonstrations. This approach avoids expensive action annotation, supports generalization across embodiments, and enables smooth, high-frequency continuous control upto 22 Hz via chunked action decoding. Unlike prior latent action works that treat pretraining as autoregressive policy learning, explicitly models both what changes and how. Our method outperforms strong baselines, with a 16% gain on the SIMPLER benchmark and a 13% improvement across real world manipulation tasks.

Each player selects actions from a finite set and evolves through a finite set of states. State transitions occur stochastically and depend on the player's chosen action. A player's single-stage reward depends on their state, action, and the population-wide distribution of states and actions, capturing aggregate effects such as congestion in traffic networks. Each player seeks to maximize a discounted infinite-horizon reward. Existing evolutionary game-theoretic approaches introduce a model for the way individual players update their decisions in static environments without individual state dynamics. In contrast, this work develops an evolutionary framework for dynamic games with explicit state evolution, which is necessary to model many applications. We introduce a mean field approximation of the finite-population game and establish approximation guarantees. Since state-of-the-art solution concepts for dynamic games lack an evolutionary interpretation, we propose a new concept - the Mixed Stationary Nash Equilibrium (MSNE) - which admits one.

Empirical results of our implementation show that hand-coded HTNs can dramatically improve LLM performance on agentic tasks, and using HTNs can boost a 20b or 70b parameter LLM to outperform a much larger 120b parameter LLM baseline. Furthermore, LLM-created HTNs improve overall performance, though less so. The results suggest that leveraging expertise--from humans, documents, or LLMs--to curate procedural knowledge will become another important tool for improving LLM workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u4efb\u52a1\u7f51\u7edc\uff08HTN\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6027\u77e5\u8bc6\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347LLM\u5728\u4ee3\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408HTN\u53ef\u4ee5\u8d85\u8d8a\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0cLLM\u751f\u6210\u7684HTN\u4e5f\u6709\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u679c\u4f46\u4e0d\u5982\u4eba\u5de5\u7f16\u7801\u7684HTN\u3002", "motivation": "LLM\u5728\u6267\u884c\u4ee3\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u5de5\u5177\u652f\u6301\u3001\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u6216\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u800c\u9886\u57df\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6027\u77e5\u8bc6\u53ef\u4ee5\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u89c4\u5212\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u5f88\u5c11\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5728\u9700\u8981\u9690\u5f0f\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5bf9LLM\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u3001\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5229\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u4efb\u52a1\u7f51\u7edc\uff08HTN\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6027\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u4ee3\u7406LLM\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u624b\u5de5\u7f16\u7801HTN\u548cLLM\u751f\u6210\u7684HTN\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u624b\u5de5\u7f16\u7801\u7684HTN\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347LLM\u5728\u4ee3\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528HTN\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f7f20b\u621670b\u53c2\u6570\u7684LLM\u8d85\u8d8a120b\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u7ebf\uff1bLLM\u751f\u6210\u7684HTN\u4e5f\u80fd\u6539\u5584\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u63d0\u5347\u5e45\u5ea6\u8f83\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5229\u7528\u6765\u81ea\u4eba\u7c7b\u3001\u6587\u6863\u6216LLM\u7684\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u6765\u6574\u7406\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6027\u77e5\u8bc6\u5c06\u6210\u4e3a\u6539\u8fdbLLM\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

A five-pillar architecture--governance, data lineage, assurance, resilience, and regulatory alignment--translates supervisory expectations from Solvency II, SR 11-7, and guidance from EIOPA (2025), NAIC (2023), and IAIS (2024) into measurable lifecycle controls. The framework is implemented through the Reinsurance AI Reliability and Assurance Benchmark (RAIRAB), which evaluates whether governance-embedded LLMs meet prudential standards for grounding, transparency, and accountability. Across six task families, retrieval-grounded configurations achieved higher grounding accuracy (0.90), reduced hallucination and interpretive drift by roughly 40%, and nearly doubled transparency. These mechanisms lower informational frictions in risk transfer and capital allocation, showing that existing prudential doctrines already accommodate reliable AI when governance is explicit, data are traceable, and assurance is verifiable.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bc4\u4f30\u518d\u4fdd\u9669\u9886\u57df\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u5ba1\u614e\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u6cbb\u7406\u3001\u6570\u636e\u6eaf\u6e90\u3001\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3001\u97e7\u6027\u548c\u76d1\u7ba1\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e94\u5927\u652f\u67f1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7RAIRAB\u57fa\u51c6\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u662f\u5426\u6ee1\u8db3\u57fa\u7840\u6027\u3001\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u95ee\u8d23\u5236\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c06Solvency II\u3001SR 11-7\u7b49\u76d1\u7ba1\u671f\u671b\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u8861\u91cf\u7684\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3LLM\u5728\u518d\u4fdd\u9669\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u98ce\u9669\u8f6c\u79fb\u548c\u8d44\u672c\u914d\u7f6e\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u6469\u64e6\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e94\u652f\u67f1\u67b6\u6784\uff08\u6cbb\u7406\u3001\u6570\u636e\u6eaf\u6e90\u3001\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3001\u97e7\u6027\u3001\u76d1\u7ba1\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7RAIRAB\u57fa\u51c6\u5b9e\u65bd\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u65cf\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\u68c0\u7d22\u57fa\u7840\u914d\u7f6e\u7684LLM\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u68c0\u7d22\u57fa\u7840\u914d\u7f6e\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff080.90\uff09\uff0c\u5e7b\u89c9\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u6f02\u79fb\u51cf\u5c11\u7ea640%\uff0c\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u51e0\u4e4e\u7ffb\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u6cbb\u7406\u660e\u786e\u3001\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u4e14\u4fdd\u8bc1\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65f6\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5ba1\u614e\u539f\u5219\u5df2\u7ecf\u80fd\u591f\u5bb9\u7eb3\u53ef\u9760\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

But the increasing complexity of SEVs prompted by greater dependence on interconnected systems, autonomous capabilities and electrification, presents new challenges in cybersecurity as well as functional safety. The safety and reliability of such vehicles is paramount, as unsafe or unreliable operation in either case represents an unacceptable risk in terms of the performance of the vehicle and safety of the passenger. This paper investigates the integrated development of cybersecurity and functional safety for SEVs, emphasizing the requirement for the parallel development of these domains as components that are not treated separately. In SEVs, cybersecurity is quite crucial in order to prevent the threats of hacking, data breaches and unauthorized access to vehicle systems. Functional safety ensures that important vehicle functions (braking, steering, battery control, etc.) keep working even if some part fails. This convergence of functional safety issues with cybersecurity issues is becoming more crucial, since a security incident can result in a failure of catastrophic consequences for a functional safety system and, conversely.

However, these statements are often vague and inconsistent, making manual review time-consuming and difficult to scale. While NLP offers a promising path forward, high-stakes compliance tasks require more than accurate classification: they demand transparent, rule-aligned outputs that legal experts can verify. Existing applications of large language models (LLMs) often reduce complex regulatory assessments to binary decisions, lacking the necessary structure for robust legal scrutiny. We argue that compliance verification is fundamentally a rule-matching problem: it requires evaluating whether textual statements adhere to well-defined regulatory rules. To this end, we propose a novel framework that harnesses AI for rule-level compliance verification while preserving expert oversight.

Yet current approaches fall short: neural retrievers lack reasoning capabilities, large language models (LLMs) provide semantic depth but at prohibitive cost, and query rewriting or decomposition limits improvement to static transformations. As a result, existing methods fail to capture the iterative dynamics of exploration, feedback, and revision that complex user queries demand. We introduce Orion, a training framework that enables compact models (350M-1.2B parameters) to perform iterative retrieval through learned search strategies. Orion combines: (1) synthetic trajectory generation and supervised fine-tuning to encourage diverse exploration patterns in models, (2) reinforcement learning (RL) that rewards effective query refinement and backtracking behaviors, and (3) inference-time beam search algorithms that exploit the self-reflection capabilities learned during RL. Despite using only 3% of the training data available, our 1.2B model achieves 77.6% success on SciFact (vs. 72.6% for prior retrievers), 25.2% on BRIGHT (vs. 22.1%), 63.2% on NFCorpus (vs. 57.8%), and remains competitive on FEVER, HotpotQA, and MSMarco. It outperforms retrievers up to 200-400x larger on five of six benchmarks.

Because of their nonlinear, underactuated dynamics and the partial observability of wind fields, prior work has largely relied on model-free reinforcement learning (RL) methods to design near-optimal control schemes for station-keeping. These methods often compare only against hand-crafted heuristics, dismissing model-based approaches as impractical given the system complexity and uncertain wind forecasts. We revisit this assumption about the efficacy of model-based control for station-keeping by developing First-Order Model Predictive Control (FOMPC). By implementing the wind and balloon dynamics as differentiable functions in JAX, we enable gradient-based trajectory optimization for online planning. FOMPC outperforms a state-of-the-art RL policy, achieving a 24% improvement in time-within-radius (TWR) without requiring offline training, though at the cost of greater online computation per control step. Through systematic ablations of modeling assumptions and control factors, we show that online planning is effective across many configurations, including under simplified wind and dynamics models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86FOMPC\uff08\u4e00\u9636\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u7a7a\u6c14\u7403\u7ad9\u63a7\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u65e0\u6a21\u578b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8624%\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u79bb\u7ebf\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u63a7\u5236\u5728\u7ad9\u63a7\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u8ba4\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u63a7\u5236\u4e0d\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5177\u6709\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u3001\u6b20\u9a71\u52a8\u7279\u6027\u548c\u98ce\u573a\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5728JAX\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u7684\u98ce\u548c\u6c14\u7403\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f18\u5316\u8fdb\u884c\u5728\u7ebf\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86FOMPC\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "FOMPC\u5728\u65f6\u95f4-\u534a\u5f84\u5185\u505c\u7559\u65f6\u95f4\uff08TWR\uff09\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684RL\u7b56\u756524%\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u7ebf\u89c4\u5212\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u90fd\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7b80\u5316\u7684\u98ce\u548c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u63a7\u5236\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002"}}

Overall, the balance between risk and benefits does not support the use of genAI in qualitative research, and our position paper cautions researchers to put sound methodology before technological novelty.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6279\u5224\u6027\u8d28\u7591\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5728\u8d28\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u7f16\u7801\u4e2d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u8ba4\u4e3a\u5176\u4f7f\u7528\u4f1a\u524a\u5f31\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u4f18\u5148\u8003\u8651\u5065\u5168\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u800c\u975e\u6280\u672f\u65b0\u9896\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740AI\u5728\u8d28\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u65e5\u76ca\u63a8\u5e7f\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u5f15\u53d1\u4e86\u6df1\u523b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u6279\u5224\u6027\u5730\u5ba1\u89c6\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5728\u8d28\u6027\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5b58\u5728\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7092\u4f5c\u548c\u6548\u7387\u58f0\u79f0\uff0c\u4f46\u4f5c\u8005\u8ba4\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5728\u8d28\u6027\u8c03\u67e5\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u7bc7\u7acb\u573a\u8bba\u6587\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6279\u5224\u6027\u5206\u6790\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5728\u8d28\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u5176\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u6587\u6863\u3001\u5546\u4e1a\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u751f\u6210\u9519\u8bef\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u5185\u5728\u503e\u5411\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u4f1a\u524a\u5f31\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u7684\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\uff0c\u98ce\u9669\u4e0e\u6536\u76ca\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u4e0d\u652f\u6301\u5728\u8d28\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u5e94\u5c06\u5065\u5168\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u7f6e\u4e8e\u6280\u672f\u65b0\u9896\u6027\u4e4b\u524d\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u5728\u8d28\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\uff0c\u4ee5\u7ef4\u62a4\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002"}}

Current solutions, which have evolved from retrieval using semantic embeddings to more sophisticated structured knowledge graphs representations for improved sense-making and associativity, are tailored for fact-based retrieval and fail to build the space-time-anchored narrative representations required for tracking entities through episodic events. To bridge this gap, we propose the \\textbf{Generative Semantic Workspace} (GSW), a neuro-inspired generative memory framework that builds structured, interpretable representations of evolving situations, enabling LLMs to reason over evolving roles, actions, and spatiotemporal contexts. Our framework comprises an \\textit{Operator}, which maps incoming observations to intermediate semantic structures, and a \\textit{Reconciler}, which integrates these into a persistent workspace that enforces temporal, spatial, and logical coherence. On the Episodic Memory Benchmark (EpBench) \\cite{huet_episodic_2025} comprising corpora ranging from 100k to 1M tokens in length, GSW outperforms existing RAG based baselines by up to \\textbf{20\\%}. Furthermore, GSW is highly efficient, reducing query-time context tokens by \\textbf{51\\%} compared to the next most token-efficient baseline, reducing inference time costs considerably.

However, existing VBTS tactile surfaces make use of silicone gels, which provide high sensitivity but easily deteriorate from loading and surface wear. We propose that polyurethane rubber, used for high-load applications like shoe soles, rubber wheels, and industrial gaskets, may provide improved physical gel resilience, potentially at the cost of sensitivity. To compare the resilience and sensitivity of silicone and polyurethane VBTS gels, we propose a series of standard evaluation benchmarking protocols. Our resilience tests assess sensor durability across normal loading, shear loading, and abrasion. For sensitivity, we introduce model-free assessments of force and spatial sensitivity to directly measure the physical capabilities of each gel without effects introduced from data and model quality.

The framework organises heterogeneous artefacts - submissions (code, text, media), communications (chat, email), coordination records (meeting logs, tasks), peer assessments, and contextual information - into three dimensions with nine benchmarks: Contribution, Interaction, and Role.

We do a rigorous comparison between two approaches. The first is the classic one in which a system identification stage is used to estimate the unknown parameters, which are then used in a state-feedback LQG (SF-LQG) controller design. The second approach is a recently proposed one using a reinforcement learning paradigm called Q-learning. We do the comparison in terms of complexity and accuracy of the resulting controller. We show that the classic approach asymptotically efficient, giving virtually no room for improvement in terms of accuracy. We also propose a novel Q-learning-based method which we show asymptotically achieves the optimal controller design. We complement our proposed method with a numerically efficient algorithmic implementation aiming at making it competitive in terms of computations. Nevertheless, our complexity analysis shows that the classic approach is still numerically more efficient than this Q-learning-based alternative.

Sustaining protective partnership state required an emergent 7-stage calibration sequence, built upon a 4-stage initialization process, within a 5-layer protection architecture enabling bias self-monitoring, human-AI adversarial challenge, partnership state verification, performance degradation detection, and stakeholder protection.\n  Three discoveries resulted: partnership state is achievable through ordered calibration but requires emergent maintenance protocols; reliability degrades when architectural drift and context exhaustion align; and dissolution discipline prevents costly pursuit of fundamentally wrong directions. Cross-model validation revealed systematic performance differences across LLM architectures.\n  This approach demonstrates that human-AI teams can achieve cognitive partnership capable of preventing avoidable regret in high-stakes decisions, addressing return-on-investment expectations that depend on AI systems supporting consequential decision-making without introducing preventable cognitive traps when verification arrives too late.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc77\u9636\u6bb5\u6821\u51c6\u5e8f\u5217\u548c5\u5c42\u4fdd\u62a4\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u4f7f\u4eba\u7c7b-AI\u56e2\u961f\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u6218\u7565\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u8ba4\u77e5\u4f19\u4f34\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u53ef\u9884\u9632\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u9677\u9631\u548c\u9057\u61be\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u9886\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u6218\u7565\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u4eba\u7c7b\u548cAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u76f8\u4e92\u5f3a\u5316\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u5a01\u80c1\u6295\u8d44\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u5408\u7406\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc4\u4f307\u4e2a\u524d\u6cbf\u7ea7LLM\u548c3\u4e2a\u5e02\u573a\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u6848\u4f8b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u8be6\u7ec6\u63d0\u793a\u6307\u5b9a\u51b3\u7b56\u4f19\u4f34\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u5305\u542b7\u9636\u6bb5\u6821\u51c6\u5e8f\u5217\u548c5\u5c42\u4fdd\u62a4\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u504f\u89c1\u81ea\u6211\u76d1\u63a7\u3001\u4eba\u673a\u5bf9\u6297\u6311\u6218\u3001\u4f19\u4f34\u72b6\u6001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7b49\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4f19\u4f34\u72b6\u6001\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u5e8f\u6821\u51c6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u7d27\u6025\u7ef4\u62a4\u534f\u8bae\uff1b\u5f53\u67b6\u6784\u6f02\u79fb\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8017\u5c3d\u540c\u65f6\u53d1\u751f\u65f6\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4f1a\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u89e3\u6563\u7eaa\u5f8b\u53ef\u907f\u514d\u8ffd\u6c42\u6839\u672c\u9519\u8bef\u65b9\u5411\u3002\u4e0d\u540cLLM\u67b6\u6784\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4eba\u7c7b-AI\u56e2\u961f\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u8ba4\u77e5\u4f19\u4f34\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u9884\u9632\u53ef\u907f\u514d\u7684\u9057\u61be\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db3\u4f9d\u8d56AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u652f\u6301\u91cd\u8981\u51b3\u7b56\u800c\u4e0d\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u9884\u9632\u8ba4\u77e5\u9677\u9631\u7684\u6295\u8d44\u56de\u62a5\u671f\u671b\u3002"}}

Current neural controllers for humanoids remain modest in size, target a limited behavior set, and are trained on a handful of GPUs over several days. We show that scaling up model capacity, data, and compute yields a generalist humanoid controller capable of creating natural and robust whole-body movements. Specifically, we posit motion tracking as a natural and scalable task for humanoid control, leverageing dense supervision from diverse motion-capture data to acquire human motion priors without manual reward engineering. We build a foundation model for motion tracking by scaling along three axes: network size (from 1.2M to 42M parameters), dataset volume (over 100M frames, 700 hours of high-quality motion data), and compute (9k GPU hours). Beyond demonstrating the benefits of scale, we show the practical utility of our model through two mechanisms: (1) a real-time universal kinematic planner that bridges motion tracking to downstream task execution, enabling natural and interactive control, and (2) a unified token space that supports various motion input interfaces, such as VR teleoperation devices, human videos, and vision-language-action (VLA) models, all using the same policy. Scaling motion tracking exhibits favorable properties: performance improves steadily with increased compute and data diversity, and learned representations generalize to unseen motions, establishing motion tracking at scale as a practical foundation for humanoid control.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u5c55\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u91cf\u3001\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u81ea\u7136\u548c\u7a33\u5065\u5168\u8eab\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u901a\u7528\u4eba\u5f62\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u5c06\u8fd0\u52a8\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4eba\u5f62\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5b58\u5728\u6570\u5341\u4ebf\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f46\u4eba\u5f62\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u4ecd\u7136\u89c4\u6a21\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u76ee\u6807\u884c\u4e3a\u96c6\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u5c55\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u91cf\u3001\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u7684\u4eba\u5f62\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u8fd0\u52a8\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4eba\u5f62\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u6355\u6349\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u5bc6\u96c6\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u624b\u52a8\u5956\u52b1\u5de5\u7a0b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u5c55\u7f51\u7edc\u89c4\u6a21\uff08\u4ece1.2M\u523042M\u53c2\u6570\uff09\u3001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u89c4\u6a21\uff08\u8d85\u8fc71\u4ebf\u5e27\uff0c700\u5c0f\u65f6\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u8fd0\u52a8\u6570\u636e\uff09\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\uff089k GPU\u5c0f\u65f6\uff09\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u8fd0\u52a8\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6269\u5c55\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u597d\u5904\uff1a\u6027\u80fd\u968f\u7740\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u6570\u636e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u7a33\u6b65\u63d0\u9ad8\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u591f\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u65f6\u901a\u7528\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u548c\u7edf\u4e00\u6807\u8bb0\u7a7a\u95f4\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6269\u5c55\u8fd0\u52a8\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u7684\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u4eba\u5f62\u63a7\u5236\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u968f\u7740\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u6570\u636e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u7a33\u6b65\u63d0\u9ad8\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u591f\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u3002"}}

In this way, aluminium smelting cells can be used as a large virtual energy storage to balance power demand-supply and stabilise electrical grids. This paper studies the potential optimal power modulation operating conditions, including time-varying line current and anode-cathode distance (ACD) profiles to maximise the aluminium reduction cell profitability subject to constraints on the cell thermal balance. To deal with the complex cell dynamics which are spatially distributed and multi-timescale, a novel optimisation approach that utilises both reduced-order and detailed models is developed.

The AIA Forecaster approach combines three core elements: agentic search over high-quality news sources, a supervisor agent that reconciles disparate forecasts for the same event, and a set of statistical calibration techniques to counter behavioral biases in large language models. On the ForecastBench benchmark (Karger et al., 2024), the AIA Forecaster achieves performance equal to human superforecasters, surpassing prior LLM baselines. In addition to reporting on ForecastBench, we also introduce a more challenging forecasting benchmark sourced from liquid prediction markets. While the AIA Forecaster underperforms market consensus on this benchmark, an ensemble combining AIA Forecaster with market consensus outperforms consensus alone, demonstrating that our forecaster provides additive information. Our work establishes a new state of the art in AI forecasting and provides practical, transferable recommendations for future research.

The UAV is modeled as a variable-speed Dubins vehicle with a line-of-sight sensor in an urban environment that may occlude the sensor's view of the POI. A search strategy is proposed that exploits a probabilistic visibility volume (VV) to plan its future motion with iterative deepening $A^\\ast$. The probabilistic VV is a time-varying three-dimensional representation of the sensing constraints for a particular distribution of the POI's state. To find the path most likely to view the POI, the planner uses a heuristic to optimistically estimate the probability of viewing the POI over a time horizon. The probabilistic VV is max-pooled to create a variable-timestep planner that reduces the search space and balances long-term and short-term planning. The proposed path planning method is compared to prior work with a Monte-Carlo simulation and is shown to outperform the baseline methods in cluttered environments when the UAV's sensor has a higher false alarm probability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6982\u7387\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u4f53\u79ef\u7684\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u641c\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u57ce\u5e02\u9053\u8def\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u5bfb\u627e\u79fb\u52a8\u7684\u5174\u8da3\u70b9\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u52a0\u6df1A*\u7b97\u6cd5\u89c4\u5212\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5728\u57ce\u5e02\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u641c\u7d22\u79fb\u52a8\u5174\u8da3\u70b9\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u89c6\u7ebf\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u5efa\u7b51\u7269\u906e\u6321\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6982\u7387\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u4f53\u79ef(VV)\u8868\u793a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u52a0\u6df1A*\u7b97\u6cd5\u89c4\u5212\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e50\u89c2\u4f30\u8ba1\u89c2\u5bdf\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u6700\u5927\u6c60\u5316\u6280\u672f\u521b\u5efa\u53ef\u53d8\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6a21\u62df\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f53\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u8bef\u62a5\u6982\u7387\u8f83\u9ad8\u65f6\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u57ce\u5e02\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002"}}

It requires the integration of several capabilities, including multi-step reasoning, cross-document synthesis, and the generation of evidence-backed, long-form answers. Evaluating DR remains challenging because responses are lengthy and diverse, admit many valid solutions, and often depend on dynamic information sources. We introduce ResearchRubrics, a standardized benchmark for DR built with over 2,800+ hours of human labor that pairs realistic, domain-diverse prompts with 2,500+ expert-written, fine-grained rubrics to assess factual grounding, reasoning soundness, and clarity. We also propose a new complexity framework for categorizing DR tasks along three axes: conceptual breadth, logical nesting, and exploration. In addition, we develop human and model-based evaluation protocols that measure rubric adherence for DR agents.

We identify key design parameters for mechanical layer jamming systems, including the ability to modulate stiffness, and perform a variety of comprehensive tests placing the specimens under bending and torsional loads to understand the influence of our selected design parameters (mainly tooth geometry) on the performance of the jammed structures. We note the ability of these structures to produce a peak change in stiffness of 5 times in bending and 3.2 times in torsion. We also measure the force required to separate the two jammed layers, an often ignored parameter in the study of jamming-induced stiffness change.

Although prior research explored scenario generation for military training, pre-LLM AI tools struggled to generate sufficiently complex or adaptable scenarios. This paper introduces a multi-agent, multi-modal reasoning framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate critical training artifacts, such as Operations Orders (OPORDs). We structure our framework by decomposing scenario generation into a hierarchy of subproblems, and for each one, defining the role of the AI tool: (1) generating options for a human author to select from, (2) producing a candidate product for human approval or modification, or (3) generating textual artifacts fully automatically. Our framework employs specialized LLM-based agents to address distinct subproblems. Each agent receives input from preceding subproblem agents, integrating both text-based scenario details and visual information (e.g., map features, unit positions and applies specialized reasoning to produce appropriate outputs. Subsequent agents process these outputs sequentially, preserving logical consistency and ensuring accurate document generation. This multi-agent strategy overcomes the limitations of basic prompting or single-agent approaches when tackling such highly complex tasks. We validate our framework through a proof-of-concept that generates the scheme of maneuver and movement section of an OPORD while estimating map positions and movements as a precursor demonstrating its feasibility and accuracy. Our results demonstrate the potential of LLM-driven multi-agent systems to generate coherent, nuanced documents and adapt dynamically to changing conditions, advancing automation in scenario generation for military training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u519b\u4e8b\u8bad\u7ec3\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6587\u6863\uff08\u5982\u4f5c\u6218\u547d\u4ee4OPORD\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u5206\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e13\u95e8\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6765\u514b\u670d\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u62df\u8bad\u7ec3\u573a\u666f\u521b\u5efa\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8017\u65f6\u8017\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u524dLLM\u65f6\u4ee3\u7684AI\u5de5\u5177\u96be\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u8db3\u591f\u590d\u6742\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e13\u95e8\u7684LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u540c\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4e09\u79cdAI\u53c2\u4e0e\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1a\u9009\u9879\u751f\u6210\u3001\u5019\u9009\u4ea7\u54c1\u751f\u6210\u3001\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5e76\u6574\u5408\u6587\u672c\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6982\u5ff5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6210\u529f\u751f\u6210\u4e86OPORD\u7684\u673a\u52a8\u65b9\u6848\u548c\u79fb\u52a8\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u4f30\u8ba1\u5730\u56fe\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u79fb\u52a8\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u8fde\u8d2f\u3001\u7ec6\u81f4\u7684\u6587\u6863\u5e76\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u5e94\u53d8\u5316\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u519b\u4e8b\u8bad\u7ec3\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8fdb\u7a0b\u3002"}}

Bio-inspired musculoskeletal robots, which integrate rigid skeletons with soft actuators, combine high load-bearing capacity with inherent flexibility. Although actuation dynamics have been studied through experimental methods and surrogate models, accurate and effective modeling and simulation remain a significant challenge, especially for large-scale hybrid rigid--soft robots with continuously distributed mass, kinematic loops, and diverse motion modes. To address these challenges, we propose EquiMus, an energy-equivalent dynamic modeling framework and MuJoCo-based simulation for musculoskeletal rigid--soft hybrid robots with linear elastic actuators. The equivalence and effectiveness of the proposed approach are validated and examined through both simulations and real-world experiments on a bionic robotic leg.

While satellite-based imaging spectrometers, such as EMIT, PRISMA, and EnMAP, can detect these point sources, current methane retrieval methods based on matched filters still produce a high number of false detections requiring laborious manual verification. This paper describes the operational deployment of a machine learning system for detecting methane emissions within the Methane Alert and Response System (MARS) of the United Nations Environment Programme's International Methane Emissions Observatory. We created the largest and most diverse global dataset of annotated methane plumes from three imaging spectrometer missions and quantitatively compared different deep learning model configurations. Focusing on the requirements for operational deployment, we extended prior evaluation methodologies from small tiled datasets to full granule evaluation. This revealed that deep learning models still produce a large number of false detections, a problem we address with model ensembling, which reduced false detections by over 74%. Deployed in the MARS pipeline, our system processes scenes and proposes plumes to analysts, accelerating the detection and analysis process. During seven months of operational deployment, it facilitated the verification of 1,351 distinct methane leaks, resulting in 479 stakeholder notifications. We further demonstrate the model's utility in verifying mitigation success through case studies in Libya, Argentina, Oman, and Azerbaijan. Our work represents a critical step towards a global AI-assisted methane leak detection system, which is required to process the dramatically higher data volumes expected from new and current imaging spectrometers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u5e76\u90e8\u7f72\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7532\u70f7\u6392\u653e\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u51cf\u5c1174%\u7684\u8bef\u62a5\uff0c\u5728\u8054\u5408\u56fdMARS\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6210\u529f\u9a8c\u8bc11351\u4e2a\u7532\u70f7\u6cc4\u6f0f\u5e76\u53d1\u51fa479\u4e2a\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u65b9\u901a\u77e5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5339\u914d\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u7684\u536b\u661f\u7532\u70f7\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bef\u62a5\u7387\u9ad8\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u4eba\u5de5\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u6765\u5904\u7406\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u957f\u7684\u536b\u661f\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u6700\u5927\u7684\u5168\u7403\u7532\u70f7\u7fbd\u6d41\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5168\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u51cf\u5c1174%\u8bef\u62a5\uff0c\u57287\u4e2a\u6708\u8fd0\u884c\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc11351\u4e2a\u7532\u70f7\u6cc4\u6f0f\uff0c\u53d1\u51fa479\u4e2a\u901a\u77e5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5229\u6bd4\u4e9a\u3001\u963f\u6839\u5ef7\u3001\u963f\u66fc\u548c\u963f\u585e\u62dc\u7586\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u4ee3\u8868\u4e86\u5411\u5168\u7403AI\u8f85\u52a9\u7532\u70f7\u6cc4\u6f0f\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fc8\u51fa\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4e00\u6b65\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u9884\u671f\u5927\u5e45\u589e\u52a0\u7684\u6210\u50cf\u5149\u8c31\u4eea\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u3002"}}

Model-based locomotion approaches typically adopt heuristic methods or planning based on the linear inverted pendulum model. These methods account for linear velocity in footstep planning, while excluding angular velocity, which leads to angular momentum being handled exclusively via ground reaction force (GRF). Footstep planning based on MPC that takes angular velocity into account recasts the angular momentum control problem as a dual-input approach that coordinates GRFs and footstep placement, instead of optimizing GRFs alone, thereby improving tracking performance. A mutual-feedback loop couples the footstep planner and the GRF MPC, with each using the other's solution to iteratively update footsteps and GRFs. The use of optimal solutions reduces body oscillation and enables extended stance and swing phases.

Positive definite barrier functions, when used in self-tuning super-twisting controllers may introduce some conservatism in relation to initial estimations of the perturbation rate bound. Moreover, discrete time implementation of the algorithm does not necessarily guarantee the boundedness of the closed-loop trajectories when sudden changes in the perturbation occur in between two time samples. The salient features of the proposed methodology pertain to extending the use of positive semidefinite barrier functions to Super-Twisting controller adaptation and the employment of a \"nested barriers\" scheme that ensures boundedness of the solutions even for \"unfavourable\" perturbations-to-sampling time ratios.

LLMs are trained to follow human alignment for safety, and post training quantization(PTQ) is applied afterward for efficiency. However, these two objectives are often in conflict, revealing a fundamental flaw in the conventional PTQ paradigm: quantization can turn into a safety vulnerability if it only aims to achieve low perplexity. Models can demonstrate low perplexity yet exhibit significant degradation in alignment with the safety policy, highlighting that perplexity alone is an insufficient and often misleading proxy for model safety. To address this, we propose Alignment-Aware Quantization(AAQ), a novel approach that integrates Alignment-Preserving Contrastive(APC) loss into the PTQ pipeline. Compared to simple reconstruction loss, ours explicitly preserves alignment by encouraging the quantized model to mimic its safe, instruction-tuned model while diverging from the unaligned, pre-trained counterpart. Our method achieves this robust safety alignment without resorting to specialized safety-focused calibration datasets, highlighting its practical utility and broad applicability. AAQ is compatible with standard PTQ techniques and enables robust 4-bit (W4A4) quantization across diverse model families such as LLaMA, Qwen, and Mistral while maintaining safety where previous methods fail. Our work resolves the critical trade-off between efficiency and safety, paving the way toward LLMs that are both efficient and trustworthy.

This paper develops a novel approach that combines tangentbased path planning and extrapolation methods to create a new decision-making algorithm for local path planning. In the assumed scenario, a UGV has a prior knowledge of its initial and target points within the dynamic environment. A global path has already been computed, and the robot is provided with waypoints along this path. As the UGV travels between these waypoints, the algorithm aims to avoid collisions with dynamic obstacles. These obstacles follow polynomial trajectories, with their initial positions randomized in the local map and velocities randomized between O and the allowable physical velocity limit of the robot, along with some random accelerations. The developed algorithm is tested in several scenarios where many dynamic obstacles move randomly in the environment. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed local path planning strategy by gradually generating a collision free path which allows the robot to navigate safely between initial and the target locations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u5207\u7ebf\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u5916\u63a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u65e0\u4eba\u5730\u9762\u8f66\u8f86\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u969c\u788d\u7269\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u907f\u969c\u5bfc\u822a\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e0\u4eba\u5730\u9762\u8f66\u8f86\u5728\u5bc6\u96c6\u52a8\u6001\u969c\u788d\u7269\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u6765\u907f\u514d\u78b0\u649e\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u5207\u7ebf\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u5916\u63a8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u5df2\u77e5\u5168\u5c40\u8def\u5f84\u548c\u8def\u70b9\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u65f6\u751f\u6210\u907f\u969c\u8def\u5f84\u3002\u969c\u788d\u7269\u9075\u5faa\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u968f\u673a\u521d\u59cb\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3001\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u52a0\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u52a8\u6001\u969c\u788d\u7269\u968f\u673a\u79fb\u52a8\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u4eff\u771f\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u9010\u6b65\u751f\u6210\u65e0\u78b0\u649e\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u4f7f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b89\u5168\u5bfc\u822a\u5230\u76ee\u6807\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u786e\u4fdd\u65e0\u4eba\u5730\u9762\u8f66\u8f86\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5bfc\u822a\u3002"}}

Different from rotor swing of SG in traditional grids mainly described by the swing equation (SE), the converter dynamics plays an indispensable role in modern renewable dominated power systems (RDPS). The high complexity of the RDPS, including spatial large-scale, nonlinearity, multi-time-scale, and even sequential switching, prevents us from fully understanding its dynamics and assessing its transient stability under large disturbance. Here, a variety of transient switching mechanism models of renewable devices relying on wind or solar energies under low-voltage ride-through are established and unified, which can be perfectly described by a generalized swing equation (GSE) under parameter changes for switching dynamics. The GSE focusing on the dominant phase-locking loop dynamics is similar to the SE. Mainly relying on the mechanical equivalence and the energy conservative principle, a substantially improved equal-area criterion method is proposed. Based on this method, even for large-scale renewable fields, the calculation errors for the critical clearing time are only about 1%.

However, most existing approaches rely on simplistic state representations and fuse heterogeneous information via naive concatenation, limiting their ability to capture rich structural and semantic context. To address these limitations, we propose GAMA, a neural neighborhood search method with Graph-aware Multi-modal Attention model in VRP. GAMA encodes the problem instance and its evolving solution as distinct modalities using graph neural networks, and models their intra- and inter-modal interactions through stacked self- and cross-attention layers. A gated fusion mechanism further integrates the multi-modal representations into a structured state, enabling the policy to make informed and generalizable operator selection decisions. Extensive experiments conducted across various synthetic and benchmark instances demonstrate that the proposed algorithm GAMA significantly outperforms the recent neural baselines.

In this work, we continue on the developed system by, firstly, evaluating its performance on recently published marine datasets. Then, we integrate the different blocks of the system on ROS platform where we could test it in real-time on synchronized LiDAR and camera data collected in various marine conditions available in the MIT marine datasets. We present a thorough experimental analysis of the results obtained using two approaches; one that uses sensor fusion between the camera and LiDAR to detect and track the obstacles and the other uses only the LiDAR point cloud for the detection and tracking.

This is the extended preprint version including appendices", "summary": "Large language models now draft news, legal analyses, and software code with human-level fluency. At the same time, regulations such as the EU AI Act mandate that each synthetic passage carry an imperceptible, machine-verifiable mark for provenance. Conventional logit-based watermarks satisfy this requirement by selecting a pseudorandom green vocabulary at every decoding step and boosting its logits, yet the random split can exclude the highest-probability token and thus erode fluency. WaterMod mitigates this limitation through a probability-aware modular rule. The vocabulary is first sorted in descending model probability; the resulting ranks are then partitioned by the residue rank mod k, which distributes adjacent-and therefore semantically similar-tokens across different classes. A fixed bias of small magnitude is applied to one selected class. In the zero-bit setting (k=2), an entropy-adaptive gate selects either the even or the odd parity as the green list. Because the top two ranks fall into different parities, this choice embeds a detectable signal while guaranteeing that at least one high-probability token remains available for sampling. In the multi-bit regime (k>2), the current payload digit d selects the color class whose ranks satisfy rank mod k = d. Biasing the logits of that class embeds exactly one base-k digit per decoding step, thereby enabling fine-grained provenance tracing. The same modular arithmetic therefore supports both binary attribution and rich payloads. Experimental results demonstrate that WaterMod consistently attains strong watermark detection performance while maintaining generation quality in both zero-bit and multi-bit settings. This robustness holds across a range of tasks, including natural language generation, mathematical reasoning, and code synthesis.

Recent work has identified game theory, particularly the concept of Nash Equilibrium (NE), as a key enabler for behavior-aware decision-making. Yet, existing work falls short of fully unleashing the power of game-theoretic reasoning. Specifically, popular optimization-based methods require simplified robot dynamics and tend to get trapped in local minima due to convexification. Other works that rely on payoff matrices suffer from poor scalability due to the explicit enumeration of all possible trajectories. To bridge this gap, we introduce Game-Theoretic Nested Search (GTNS), a novel, scalable, and provably correct approach for computing NEs in general dynamical systems. GTNS efficiently searches the action space of all agents involved, while discarding trajectories that violate the NE constraint (no unilateral deviation) through an inner search over a lower-dimensional space. Our algorithm enables explicit selection among equilibria by utilizing a user-specified global objective, thereby capturing a rich set of realistic interactions. We demonstrate the approach on a variety of autonomous driving and racing scenarios where we achieve solutions in mere seconds on commodity hardware.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faGame-Theoretic Nested Search (GTNS)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u4e00\u822c\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8ba1\u7b97\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7b80\u5316\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3001\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u4f18\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff1a\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u7b80\u5316\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e14\u5bb9\u6613\u9677\u5165\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u4f18\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u6536\u76ca\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u663e\u5f0f\u679a\u4e3e\u6240\u6709\u8f68\u8ff9\u800c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5dee\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u5728\u4e00\u822c\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "GTNS\u7b97\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u6240\u6709\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u6548\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u5185\u90e8\u641c\u7d22\u5728\u4f4e\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u4e22\u5f03\u8fdd\u53cd\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\u7ea6\u675f\uff08\u65e0\u5355\u8fb9\u504f\u79bb\uff09\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002\u5229\u7528\u7528\u6237\u6307\u5b9a\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u76ee\u6807\u5728\u5747\u8861\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u663e\u5f0f\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u548c\u8d5b\u8f66\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5728\u666e\u901a\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u4ec5\u9700\u6570\u79d2\u5373\u53ef\u83b7\u5f97\u89e3\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "GTNS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6355\u6349\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u73b0\u5b9e\u4ea4\u4e92\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u63a8\u7406\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

This work addresses this out-of-distribution (OOD) challenge by building a domain-specific time-series foundation model (PE-TSFM) that learns representations directly from large-scale unlabeled converter data. Unlike generic TSFMs trained on broad time-series datasets, the proposed PE-TSFM is pre-trained entirely on domain data, enabling it to learn the physical relationships unique to power electronics. To further tailor the model to this domain, we introduce a dual-attention mechanism that captures both temporal patterns and inter-channel dependencies. While generic TSFMs primarily model temporal dependencies, the added channel attention captures inter-sensor physical relationships essential for converter degradation analysis. A dataset containing 141 million unlabeled timestamps from an operating power converter is used for pre-training. Experiments show that PE-TSFM achieves 92% accuracy under unseen operating conditions. In contrast, generic TSFMs achieve around 60% and conventional time-series models achieve around 40% accuracy. This result confirms the strong OOD generalization of the proposed PE-TSFM. Ablation studies further verify that the introduced channel attention mechanism significantly improves model performance. In addition, we conduct detailed studies on model scalability, hyperparameter sensitivity, and interpretability to provide a comprehensive understanding of the proposed approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86PE-TSFM\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9\u7535\u529b\u7535\u5b50\u9886\u57df\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u9886\u57df\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u5065\u5eb7\u76d1\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u6cdb\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u5de5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u7535\u529b\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u5065\u5eb7\u76d1\u6d4b\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u5de5\u51b5\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u901a\u7528\u65f6\u5e8f\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7535\u529b\u7535\u5b50\u9886\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578bPE-TSFM\uff0c\u5b8c\u5168\u5728\u7535\u529b\u7535\u5b50\u9886\u57df\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u53cc\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u540c\u65f6\u6355\u6349\u65f6\u95f4\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u901a\u9053\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "PE-TSFM\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u5de5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8fbe\u523092%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u901a\u7528\u65f6\u5e8f\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u7ea660%\uff09\u548c\u4f20\u7edf\u65f6\u5e8f\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u7ea640%\uff09\uff0c\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u901a\u9053\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u53cc\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u7535\u529b\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u5065\u5eb7\u76d1\u6d4b\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u7535\u529b\u7535\u5b50\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

We present a confidence-aware decoding framework that couples deep ensembles of compact, speech-oriented convolutional networks with post-hoc calibration and selective classification. Uncertainty is quantified using ensemble-based predictive entropy, top-two margin, and mutual information, and decisions are made with an abstain option governed by an accuracy-coverage operating point. The approach is evaluated on a multi-class overt speech dataset using a leakage-safe, block-stratified split that respects temporal contiguity.

Electrostatic film actuators offer several advantages, including thinness, flexibility, lightweight construction, and high open-loop positioning accuracy. However, the actuation stress exhibited by conventional actuators in air still needs improvement, particularly for the widely used three-phase electrode design. To enhance the output performance of actuators, this paper presents a two-layer electrostatic film actuator with an integrated brake. By alternately distributing electrodes on both the top and bottom layers, a smaller effective electrode pitch is achieved under the same fabrication constraints, resulting in an actuation stress of approximately 241~N/m$^2$, representing a 90.5\\% improvement over previous three-phase actuators operating in air. Furthermore, its integrated electrostatic adhesion mechanism enables load retention under braking mode. Several demonstrations, including a tug-of-war between a conventional single-layer actuator and the proposed two-layer actuator, a payload operation, a one-degree-of-freedom robotic arm, and a dual-mode gripper, were conducted to validate the actuator's advantageous capabilities in both actuation and braking modes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5177\u6709\u96c6\u6210\u5236\u52a8\u529f\u80fd\u7684\u4e24\u5c42\u9759\u7535\u8584\u819c\u81f4\u52a8\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u5c42\u4ea4\u66ff\u5206\u5e03\u7535\u6781\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5c0f\u7684\u6709\u6548\u7535\u6781\u95f4\u8ddd\uff0c\u5728\u7a7a\u6c14\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u7ea6241 N/m\u00b2\u7684\u81f4\u52a8\u5e94\u529b\uff0c\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u4e09\u76f8\u81f4\u52a8\u5668\u63d0\u534790.5%\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u5907\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4fdd\u6301\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7535\u673a\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728\u8d28\u91cf\u5927\u3001\u63a7\u5236\u7b97\u6cd5\u590d\u6742\u3001\u9700\u8981\u989d\u5916\u5236\u52a8\u673a\u5236\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u8f7b\u91cf\u7d27\u51d1\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u9759\u7535\u8584\u819c\u81f4\u52a8\u5668\u5728\u7a7a\u6c14\u4e2d\u7684\u81f4\u52a8\u5e94\u529b\u4ecd\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e24\u5c42\u9759\u7535\u8584\u819c\u81f4\u52a8\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u9876\u5c42\u548c\u5e95\u5c42\u4ea4\u66ff\u5206\u5e03\u7535\u6781\uff0c\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u5236\u9020\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5c0f\u7684\u6709\u6548\u7535\u6781\u95f4\u8ddd\uff0c\u5e76\u96c6\u6210\u4e86\u9759\u7535\u7c98\u9644\u5236\u52a8\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u81f4\u52a8\u5e94\u529b\u8fbe\u5230\u7ea6241 N/m\u00b2\uff0c\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u4e09\u76f8\u81f4\u52a8\u5668\u63d0\u534790.5%\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u62d4\u6cb3\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3001\u8d1f\u8f7d\u64cd\u4f5c\u3001\u5355\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u548c\u53cc\u6a21\u5f0f\u5939\u722a\u7b49\u6f14\u793a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u81f4\u52a8\u548c\u5236\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u4e24\u5c42\u9759\u7535\u8584\u819c\u81f4\u52a8\u5668\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u81f4\u52a8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u96c6\u6210\u4e86\u5236\u52a8\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7d27\u51d1\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5e73\u53f0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Despite growing interest in brain-computer interface technologies, relatively little attention has been paid to developing EEG-based communication support systems tailored for aphasic patients. To address this gap, we recruited a single participant with expressive aphasia and conducted an Korean-based automatic speech task. EEG signals were recorded during task performance, and each trial was labeled as either correct or incorrect depending on whether the intended word was successfully spoken. Spectral analysis revealed distinct neural activation patterns between the two trial types: misarticulated trials exhibited excessive delta power across widespread channels and increased theta-alpha activity in frontal regions. Building upon these findings, we developed a soft multitask learning framework with maximum mean discrepancy regularization that focus on delta features to jointly optimize class discrimination while aligning the EEG feature distributions of correct and misarticulated trials. The proposed model achieved 58.6 % accuracy for correct and 45.5 % for misarticulated trials-outperforming the baseline by over 45 % on the latter-demonstrating robust intention decoding even under articulation errors.

In contrast to typical swarm robotics research, our robots are elongated and exhibit complex kinematics, introducing unique challenges. Despite its relevance to real-world applications such as logistics automation, remote mining, airport baggage transport, and agricultural operations, this problem has not been addressed in the existing literature.\n  To tackle this new class of swarm robotics problems, we propose a purely reaction-based, decentralized swarm intelligence strategy tailored to automate elongated, articulated vehicles. The method presented in this paper prioritizes jackknifing avoidance and establishes a foundation for mutual collision avoidance. We validate our approach through extensive simulation experiments and provide a comprehensive analysis of its performance.

However, training reliable RMs under limited resources remains challenging due to the reliance on large-scale preference annotations and the high cost of fine-tuning LLMs. To address this, we propose SparseRM, which leverages Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) to extract preference-relevant information encoded in model representations, enabling the construction of a lightweight and interpretable reward model. SparseRM first employs SAE to decompose LLM representations into interpretable directions that capture preference-relevant features. The representations are then projected onto these directions to compute alignment scores, which quantify the strength of each preference feature in the representations. A simple reward head aggregates these scores to predict preference scores. Experiments on three preference modeling tasks show that SparseRM achieves superior performance over most mainstream RMs while using less than 1% of trainable parameters. Moreover, it integrates seamlessly into downstream alignment pipelines, highlighting its potential for efficient alignment.", "AI": {"tldr": "SparseRM\u5229\u7528\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4eceLLM\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u504f\u597d\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u52301%\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e3b\u6d41RM\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u504f\u597d\u6807\u6ce8\u548c\u6602\u8d35\u7684LLM\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5728\u6709\u9650\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0b\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ef\u9760\u7684RM\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5206\u89e3LLM\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bf9\u9f50\u5206\u6570\u91cf\u5316\u504f\u597d\u7279\u5f81\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u5956\u52b1\u5934\u805a\u5408\u9884\u6d4b\u504f\u597d\u5206\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u504f\u597d\u5efa\u6a21\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cSparseRM\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u5927\u591a\u6570\u4e3b\u6d41RM\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u53c2\u6570\u4f7f\u7528\u91cf\u4e0d\u52301%\u3002", "conclusion": "SparseRM\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u4e0b\u6e38\u5bf9\u9f50\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u3002"}}

Probabilistic inference-based MPC approaches, such as Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control, have gained significant attention by reinterpreting optimal control as a problem of probabilistic inference.

The proposed active short circuit and safe discharge mechanisms are also included in this work, dedicated to multi-phase converters in failure conditions. With silicon carbide (SiC) power modules increasingly used in high efficiency and high-power applications, the reliability under fault conditions is an extremely important factor. Cascading failures and permanent damage will occur in multi phase inverter systems if short circuit faults are not prevented. The proposed method combines one centralized short circuit detection, active phase shorting and controlled discharge to make these structures more robust. The on chip active short circuit mechanism isolates the affected phases quickly preventing faults from spreading to other areas of the inverter and the safe discharge mechanism controls energy discharged in fault scenarios, which reduces the thermal stress placed on essential components. The experimental results show that the proposed mechanisms can effectively enhance a fault detection performance, system response during faults, and the operation as whole at faults over the several existing methods. These mechanisms are demonstrated to be very important for enhancing the safety and reliability of multiphase inverters, especially for critical applications of such inverters as EV where high operational security is required.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u76f8\u9006\u53d8\u5668\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u77ed\u8def\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u653e\u7535\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u7535\u52a8\u6c7d\u8f66\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6545\u969c\u4fdd\u62a4\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u78b3\u5316\u7845\u529f\u7387\u6a21\u5757\u5728\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u3001\u9ad8\u529f\u7387\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u591a\u76f8\u9006\u53d8\u5668\u5728\u6545\u969c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u53d8\u5f97\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u77ed\u8def\u6545\u969c\u5982\u4e0d\u52a0\u4ee5\u9884\u9632\uff0c\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u7ea7\u8054\u6545\u969c\u548c\u6c38\u4e45\u6027\u635f\u574f\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u77ed\u8def\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u4e3b\u52a8\u76f8\u95f4\u77ed\u8def\u548c\u53d7\u63a7\u653e\u7535\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u82af\u7247\u4e0a\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u77ed\u8def\u673a\u5236\u5feb\u901f\u9694\u79bb\u53d7\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u76f8\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u6545\u969c\u6269\u6563\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b89\u5168\u653e\u7535\u673a\u5236\u63a7\u5236\u6545\u969c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u91ca\u653e\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u673a\u5236\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u6545\u969c\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u6545\u969c\u671f\u95f4\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6574\u4f53\u5728\u6545\u969c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u673a\u5236\u5bf9\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad8\u591a\u76f8\u9006\u53d8\u5668\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u7535\u52a8\u6c7d\u8f66\u7b49\u5bf9\u8fd0\u884c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u8981\u6c42\u6781\u9ad8\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u3002"}}

Most prior explainable AI (XAI) approaches have focused on interpreting and explaining how models make predictions. In contrast, we would like to understand how data can be explained with deep learning model training and propose a novel approach to understand the data via one of the most common media - language - so that humans can easily understand. Our approach proposes a pipeline to generate textual descriptions that can explain the data with large language models by incorporating external knowledge bases. However, generated data descriptions may still include irrelevant information, so we introduce to exploit influence estimation to choose the most informative textual descriptions, along with the CLIP score. Furthermore, based on the phenomenon of cross-modal transferability, we propose a novel benchmark task named cross-modal transfer classification to examine the effectiveness of our textual descriptions. In the experiment of zero-shot setting, we show that our textual descriptions are more effective than other baseline descriptions, and furthermore, we successfully boost the performance of the model trained only on images across all nine image classification datasets. These results are further supported by evaluation using GPT-4o.

However, effective multi-agent interaction necessitates robust perspective-taking capabilities, enabling models to interpret both physical and epistemic viewpoints. Current training paradigms often neglect these interactive contexts, resulting in challenges when models must reason about the subjectivity of individual perspectives or navigate environments with multiple observers. This study evaluates whether explicitly incorporating diverse points of view using the ReAct framework, an approach that integrates reasoning and acting, can enhance an LLM's ability to understand and ground the demands of other agents. We extend the classic Director task by introducing active visual exploration across a suite of seven scenarios of increasing perspective-taking complexity. These scenarios are designed to challenge the agent's capacity to resolve referential ambiguity based on visual access and interaction, under varying state representations and prompting strategies, including ReAct-style reasoning. Our results demonstrate that explicit perspective cues, combined with active exploration strategies, significantly improve the model's interpretative accuracy and collaborative effectiveness.

The unpredictable evolution of state variables poses a significant challenge for meeting predefined constraints using various control methods. To address this, we present a new algorithm that computes safe policies to determine the safety level across a finite state set. This algorithm reduces the safety objective to the standard average reward Markov Decision Process (MDP) objective.

In order to overcome the limitations of existing negative sampling strategies, such as vulnerability to false negatives, limited generalization, and lack of control over sample hardness, we propose DANS-KGC (Diffusion-based Adaptive Negative Sampling for Knowledge Graph Completion). DANS-KGC comprises three key components: the Difficulty Assessment Module (DAM), the Adaptive Negative Sampling Module (ANS), and the Dynamic Training Mechanism (DTM). DAM evaluates the learning difficulty of entities by integrating semantic and structural features. Based on this assessment, ANS employs a conditional diffusion model with difficulty-aware noise scheduling, leveraging semantic and neighborhood information during the denoising phase to generate negative samples of diverse hardness. DTM further enhances learning by dynamically adjusting the hardness distribution of negative samples throughout training, enabling a curriculum-style progression from easy to hard examples.

Despite their success in open-loop evaluations, these systems often exhibit significant performance degradation in closed-loop scenarios due to causal confusion. This confusion is fundamentally exacerbated by the overreliance of the imitation learning paradigm on expert trajectories, which often contain unattributable noise and interfere with the modeling of causal relationships between environmental contexts and appropriate driving actions.\n  To address this fundamental limitation, we propose Perception-Guided Self-Supervision (PGS) - a simple yet effective training paradigm that leverages perception outputs as the primary supervisory signals, explicitly modeling causal relationships in decision-making. The proposed framework aligns both the inputs and outputs of the decision-making module with perception results, such as lane centerlines and the predicted motions of surrounding agents, by introducing positive and negative self-supervision for the ego trajectory. This alignment is specifically designed to mitigate causal confusion arising from the inherent noise in expert trajectories.\n  Equipped with perception-driven supervision, our method, built on a standard end-to-end architecture, achieves a Driving Score of 78.08 and a mean success rate of 48.64% on the challenging closed-loop Bench2Drive benchmark, significantly outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods, including those employing more complex network architectures and inference pipelines. These results underscore the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed PGS framework and point to a promising direction for addressing causal confusion and enhancing real-world generalization in autonomous driving.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u611f\u77e5\u5f15\u5bfc\u81ea\u76d1\u7763(PGS)\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u611f\u77e5\u8f93\u51fa\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e3b\u8981\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u6df7\u6dc6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u5c01\u95ed\u73af\u8bc4\u6d4b\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e13\u5bb6\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8f68\u8ff9\u5305\u542b\u4e0d\u53ef\u5f52\u56e0\u7684\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u5e72\u6270\u4e86\u73af\u5883\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e0e\u9a7e\u9a76\u52a8\u4f5c\u4e4b\u95f4\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u5c01\u95ed\u73af\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u611f\u77e5\u7ed3\u679c\uff08\u5982\u8f66\u9053\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7ebf\u548c\u5468\u56f4\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u9884\u6d4b\u8fd0\u52a8\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e3b\u8981\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u6b63\u8d1f\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u6765\u5bf9\u9f50\u51b3\u7b56\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0e\u611f\u77e5\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u5efa\u6a21\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u5728Bench2Drive\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u9a7e\u9a76\u5206\u6570\u8fbe\u523078.08\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4e3a48.64%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4f7f\u7528\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "PGS\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u56e0\u679c\u6df7\u6dc6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

This study investigated the neurophysiological mechanisms of adaptive reasoning using a card-sorting paradigm combined with electroencephalography and compared human performance with that of a multimodal large language model.

In contrast, the multimodal large language model exhibited only short-term feedback-driven adjustments without hierarchical rule abstraction or genuine adaptive reasoning. These findings identify the neural signatures of human adaptive reasoning and highlight the need for brain-inspired artificial intelligence that incorporates oscillatory feedback coordination for true context-sensitive adaptation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u8111\u7535\u56fe\u548c\u5361\u7247\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0delta-theta-alpha\u632f\u8361\u534f\u8c03\u53c2\u4e0e\u89c4\u5219\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u800c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u4f7f\u4eba\u7c7b\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u73af\u5883\u89c4\u5219\u6216\u60c5\u5883\u53d8\u5316\u65f6\u7075\u6d3b\u8c03\u6574\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u673a\u5236\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5361\u7247\u5206\u7c7b\u8303\u5f0f\u7ed3\u5408\u8111\u7535\u56fe\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4eba\u7c7b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u523a\u6fc0\u9501\u5b9a\u548c\u53cd\u9988\u9501\u5b9a\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u6d3b\u52a8\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u534f\u8c03\u7684delta-theta-alpha\u52a8\u6001\uff1a\u65e9\u671fdelta-theta\u6d3b\u52a8\u53cd\u6620\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u76d1\u6d4b\u548c\u89c4\u5219\u63a8\u65ad\uff0c\u800c\u6795\u53f6alpha\u53c2\u4e0e\u8868\u660e\u6210\u529f\u89c4\u5219\u8bc6\u522b\u540e\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ec5\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u77ed\u671f\u53cd\u9988\u9a71\u52a8\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5c42\u6b21\u89c4\u5219\u62bd\u8c61\u6216\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u5305\u542b\u632f\u8361\u53cd\u9988\u534f\u8c03\u7684\u8111\u542f\u53d1\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u654f\u611f\u9002\u5e94\u3002"}}

With the ever-increasing incorporation of these data-driven models into the estimation domain, model predictions with reliable margins of error are a requirement -- especially for safety-critical applications. This paper discusses the application of a novel real-time, data-driven estimation approach based on the multi-fidelity residual physics-informed neural process (MFR-PINP) toward the real-time state estimation of a robotic system. Specifically, we address the model-mismatch issue of selecting an accurate kinematic model by tasking the MFR-PINP to also learn the residuals between simple, low-fidelity predictions and complex, high-fidelity ground-truth dynamics. To account for model uncertainty present in a physical implementation, robust uncertainty guarantees from the split conformal (SC) prediction framework are modeled in the training and inference paradigms. We provide implementation details of our MFR-PINP-based estimator for a hybrid online learning setting to validate our model's usage in real-time applications. Experimental results of our approach's performance in comparison to the state-of-the-art variants of the Kalman filter (i.e. unscented Kalman filter and deep Kalman filter) in estimation scenarios showed promising results for the MFR-PINP model as a viable option in real-time estimation tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u6b8b\u5dee\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u795e\u7ecf\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff08MFR-PINP\uff09\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5206\u88c2\u4fdd\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u9760\u8bef\u5dee\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u65f6\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u6b8b\u5dee\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u795e\u7ecf\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff08MFR-PINP\uff09\u5b66\u4e60\u7b80\u5355\u4f4e\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u590d\u6742\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u771f\u5b9e\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5206\u88c2\u4fdd\u5f62\uff08SC\uff09\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\u5efa\u6a21\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u53d8\u4f53\uff08\u65e0\u8ff9\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\uff09\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cMFR-PINP\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4f30\u8ba1\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6709\u5e0c\u671b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "MFR-PINP\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5b9e\u65f6\u4f30\u8ba1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

This results from an inherent risk in road traffic, which arises from multiple sources of complexity and can never be fully eliminated. One central challenge lies in developing a defensible case that the residual risk has been reduced to a reasonable level. While a safety argumentation is a common means to represent this case, there is a need to guide its creation and maintenance by adequate processes. In this paper, we derive requirements for a safety argumentation lifecycle based on examining the current state of the art. In particular, the requirement-driven process design accounts for both identified limitations of current process specifications and implicit knowledge contained in related work. Subsequently, we reflect on interdependencies between the resulting safety argumentation lifecycle and the system lifecycle. Moreover, we discuss a gap in literature regarding transparent ex ante risk communication. Correspondingly, we introduce the concept of representation-supported communication that is based on deriving representations from the argumentation with respect to target stakeholders and communication purposes. Finally, we demonstrate how this approach can be integrated into the system lifecycle to facilitate stakeholder communication.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b89\u5168\u8bba\u8bc1\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bba\u8bc1\u7684\u8868\u793a\u652f\u6301\u901a\u4fe1\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u6c9f\u901a\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fd0\u884c\u4e0d\u53ef\u907f\u514d\u5730\u4f1a\u53d1\u751f\u4e8b\u6545\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u53ef\u8fa9\u62a4\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\u8bc1\u660e\u6b8b\u4f59\u98ce\u9669\u5df2\u964d\u81f3\u5408\u7406\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u4f46\u76ee\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6307\u5bfc\u5b89\u5168\u8bba\u8bc1\u521b\u5efa\u548c\u7ef4\u62a4\u7684\u9002\u5f53\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u73b0\u72b6\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u5b89\u5168\u8bba\u8bc1\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u5f53\u524d\u6d41\u7a0b\u89c4\u8303\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u9690\u542b\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4ece\u8bba\u8bc1\u4e2d\u63a8\u5bfc\u9488\u5bf9\u76ee\u6807\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u548c\u6c9f\u901a\u76ee\u7684\u7684\u8868\u793a\u652f\u6301\u901a\u4fe1\u6982\u5ff5\u3002", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u8bba\u8bc1\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u5173\u4e8e\u900f\u660e\u4e8b\u524d\u98ce\u9669\u6c9f\u901a\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u53ef\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u7cfb\u7edf\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u793a\u652f\u6301\u901a\u4fe1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8bba\u8bc1\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u548c\u8868\u793a\u652f\u6301\u901a\u4fe1\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u6307\u5bfc\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8bba\u8bc1\u521b\u5efa\u3001\u7ef4\u62a4\u548c\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u6c9f\u901a\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5efa\u7acb\u53ef\u8fa9\u62a4\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6848\u4f8b\u3002"}}

The system integrates a lightweight conditional diffusion encoder and convolutional classifier trained using subject-specific EEG data acquired from a Korean-language paradigm. A dual-criterion early stopping strategy enabled rapid convergence under limited calibration data, while dropout regularization and grouped temporal convolutions ensured stable generalization. During online operation, continuous EEG streams were processed in two-second sliding windows to generate class probabilities that dynamically modulated visual and auditory feedback according to decoding confidence. Across twenty real-time trials, the framework achieved 65% top-1 and 70% top-2 accuracy, outperforming offline evaluation (50% top-1). These results demonstrate the feasibility of deploying diffusion-based EEG decoding under practical clinical constraints, maintaining reliable performance despite environmental variability and minimal preprocessing.

However, extending these methods to quadruped robots remains challenging due to their distinct and highly dynamic motion patterns. Models that perform well on pedestrian data often experience severe degradation when deployed on legged platforms. To tackle this challenge, we introduce X-IONet, a cross-platform inertial odometry framework that operates solely using a single Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). X-IONet incorporates a rule-based expert selection module to classify motion platforms and route IMU sequences to platform-specific expert networks. The displacement prediction network features a dual-stage attention architecture that jointly models long-range temporal dependencies and inter-axis correlations, enabling accurate motion representation. It outputs both displacement and associated uncertainty, which are further fused through an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) for robust state estimation. Extensive experiments on public pedestrian datasets and a self-collected quadruped robot dataset demonstrate that X-IONet achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing Absolute Trajectory Error (ATE) by 14.3% and Relative Trajectory Error (RTE) by 11.4% on pedestrian data, and by 52.8% and 41.3% on quadruped robot data.

Yet existing studies on mathematics problem generation have focused on data augmentation for training neural language models rather than on direct educational deployment. To bridge this gap, we define a new task, Isomorphic Math Problem Generation (IMPG), designed to produce structurally consistent variants of source problems. Subsequently, we explored LLM-based frameworks for automatic IMPG through successive refinements, and established Computational Blueprints for Isomorphic Twins (CBIT). With meta-level generation and template-based selective variation, CBIT achieves high mathematical correctness and structural consistency while reducing the cost of generation. Empirical results across refinements demonstrate that CBIT is superior on generation accuracy and cost-effectiveness at scale.

Each body part is controlled by a phase variable capable of forward and backward evolution, with a phase coverage reward to promote the exploration of the leg phase space. Additionally, morphological symmetry of the robot is incorporated via data augmentation, improving sample efficiency and enforcing both motion-level and task-level symmetry in learned behaviors.

Extended version with full Appendix", "summary": "Efficient retrieval of external knowledge bases and web pages is crucial for enhancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs. Previous works on training LLMs to leverage external retrievers for solving complex problems have predominantly employed end-to-end reinforcement learning. However, these approaches neglect supervision over the reasoning process, making it difficult to guarantee logical coherence and rigor. To address these limitations, we propose Thinker, a hierarchical thinking model for deep search through multi-turn interaction, making the reasoning process supervisable and verifiable. It decomposes complex problems into independently solvable sub-problems, each dually represented in both natural language and an equivalent logical function to support knowledge base and web searches. Concurrently, dependencies between sub-problems are passed as parameters via these logical functions, enhancing the logical coherence of the problem-solving process. To avoid unnecessary external searches, we perform knowledge boundary determination to check if a sub-problem is within the LLM's intrinsic knowledge, allowing it to answer directly. Experimental results indicate that with as few as several hundred training samples, the performance of Thinker is competitive with established baselines. Furthermore, when scaled to the full training set, Thinker significantly outperforms these methods across various datasets and model sizes.

However, current intent inference methods often ignore subtle motion that can be strong indicators for a sudden change in intent. Specifically, we aim to tackle 1) if we can detect sudden jumps in operator trajectories, 2) how we appropriately use these sudden jump motions to infer an operator's goal state, and 3) how to incorporate these discontinuous and continuous dynamics to infer operator motion. Our framework, called Psychic, models these small indicative motions through a jump-drift-diffusion stochastic differential equation to cover discontinuous and continuous dynamics. Kramers-Moyal (KM) coefficients allow us to detect jumps with a trajectory which we pair with a statistical outlier detection algorithm to nominate goal transitions. Through identifying jumps, we can perform early detection of existing goals and discover undefined goals in unstructured scenarios. Our framework then applies a Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) model using KM coefficients with the goal transitions as a control input to infer an operator's motion behavior in unstructured scenarios. We demonstrate Psychic can produce probabilistic reachability sets and compare our strategy to a negative log-likelihood model fit. We perform a retrospective study on 600 operator trajectories in a hands-free teleoperation task to evaluate the efficacy of our opensource package, Psychic, in both offline and online learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Psychic\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8df3\u8dc3-\u6f02\u79fb-\u6269\u6563\u968f\u673a\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u5efa\u6a21\u64cd\u4f5c\u8005\u7684\u7ec6\u5fae\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Kramers-Moyal\u7cfb\u6570\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u76ee\u6807\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u65e9\u671f\u68c0\u6d4b\u64cd\u4f5c\u8005\u610f\u56fe\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u610f\u56fe\u63a8\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f80\u5f80\u5ffd\u7565\u7ec6\u5fae\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u800c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8fd0\u52a8\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u610f\u56fe\u7a81\u7136\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u5f3a\u6307\u6807\u3002\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\uff1a1\uff09\u68c0\u6d4b\u64cd\u4f5c\u8005\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e2d\u7684\u7a81\u7136\u8df3\u8dc3\uff1b2\uff09\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8df3\u8dc3\u8fd0\u52a8\u63a8\u65ad\u64cd\u4f5c\u8005\u76ee\u6807\u72b6\u6001\uff1b3\uff09\u7ed3\u5408\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u548c\u8fde\u7eed\u52a8\u6001\u63a8\u65ad\u64cd\u4f5c\u8005\u8fd0\u52a8\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u8df3\u8dc3-\u6f02\u79fb-\u6269\u6563\u968f\u673a\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u548c\u8fde\u7eed\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Kramers-Moyal\u7cfb\u6570\u68c0\u6d4b\u8df3\u8dc3\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7edf\u8ba1\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b97\u6cd5\u63d0\u540d\u76ee\u6807\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528SINDy\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u65ad\u64cd\u4f5c\u8005\u8fd0\u52a8\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u5728600\u4e2a\u64cd\u4f5c\u8005\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u56de\u987e\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86Psychic\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u6982\u7387\u53ef\u8fbe\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u79bb\u7ebf\u548c\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u73b0\u6709\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u53d1\u73b0\u672a\u5b9a\u4e49\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "conclusion": "Psychic\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u64cd\u4f5c\u8005\u610f\u56fe\u7684\u7a81\u7136\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u9065\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e9\u671f\u610f\u56fe\u63a8\u65ad\uff0c\u4e3a\u64cd\u4f5c\u8005\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4f19\u4f34\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u884c\u52a8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

A major challenge lies in modeling the intrinsic stochasticity of temporal dynamics, as real-world sequences often exhibit random fluctuations and localized variations. While diffusion models have achieved remarkable success, their generation process is computationally inefficient, often requiring hundreds to thousands of expensive function evaluations per sample. Flow matching has emerged as a more efficient paradigm, yet its conventional ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based formulation fails to explicitly capture stochasticity, thereby limiting the fidelity of generated sequences. By contrast, stochastic differential equation (SDE) are naturally suited for modeling randomness and uncertainty. Motivated by these insights, we propose TimeFlow, a novel SDE-based flow matching framework that integrates a encoder-only architecture. Specifically, we design a component-wise decomposed velocity field to capture the multi-faceted structure of time series and augment the vanilla flow-matching optimization with an additional stochastic term to enhance representational expressiveness. TimeFlow is flexible and general, supporting both unconditional and conditional generation tasks within a unified framework.

Here, we propose a tactile-encoded BCI that leverages sensory afferents through a novel tactile-evoked P300 paradigm, allowing intuitive and reliable decoding of supernumerary motor intentions even when superimposed with voluntary actions. The interface was evaluated in a multi-day experiment comprising of a single motor recognition task to validate baseline BCI performance and a dual task paradigm to assess the potential influence between the BCI and natural human movement. The brain interface achieved real-time and reliable decoding of four supernumerary degrees of freedom, with significant performance improvements after only three days of training.

Addressing these challenges, we introduce VersAtile and Risk-Sensitive cardiac diagnosis (VARS), an innovative approach that employs a graph-based representation to uniformly model heterogeneous ECG signals. VARS stands out by transforming ECG signals into versatile graph structures that capture critical diagnostic features, irrespective of signal diversity in the lead count, sampling frequency, and duration. This graph-centric formulation also enhances diagnostic sensitivity, enabling precise localization and identification of abnormal ECG patterns that often elude standard analysis methods. To facilitate representation transformation, our approach integrates denoising reconstruction with contrastive learning to preserve raw ECG information while highlighting pathognomonic patterns. We rigorously evaluate the efficacy of VARS on three distinct ECG datasets, encompassing a range of structural variations. The results demonstrate that VARS not only consistently surpasses existing state-of-the-art models across all these datasets but also exhibits substantial improvement in identifying risk signals. Additionally, VARS offers interpretability by pinpointing the exact waveforms that lead to specific model outputs, thereby assisting clinicians in making informed decisions. These findings suggest that our VARS will likely emerge as an invaluable tool for comprehensive cardiac health assessment.", "AI": {"tldr": "VARS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u7684\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u7edf\u4e00\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u540c\u914d\u7f6e\u7684ECG\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60ECG\u8bca\u65ad\u4e2d\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u969c\u788d\uff1a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5904\u7406\u591a\u6837\u5316ECG\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u7531\u4e8e\u6837\u672c\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u4fe1\u53f7\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7684\u8868\u793a\u7edf\u4e00\u5efa\u6a21\u5f02\u8d28ECG\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5c06ECG\u4fe1\u53f7\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u53bb\u566a\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u6765\u4fdd\u7559\u539f\u59cb\u4fe1\u606f\u5e76\u7a81\u51fa\u75c5\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684ECG\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cVARS\u5728\u6240\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6301\u7eed\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u98ce\u9669\u4fe1\u53f7\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "VARS\u5c06\u6210\u4e3a\u5168\u9762\u5fc3\u810f\u5065\u5eb7\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u5b9d\u8d35\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u786e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5bfc\u81f4\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u6ce2\u5f62\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u4e34\u5e8a\u533b\u751f\u505a\u51fa\u660e\u667a\u51b3\u7b56\u3002"}}

The resection planner operates directly on segmented CT volumes of prostate phantoms, automatically generating tool trajectories for a three-phase median lobe resection workflow: left/median trough resection, right/median trough resection, and median blunt dissection. The retraction network, PushCVAE, trained on surgeon demonstrations, generates retractions according to the procedural phase. The procedure is executed under Level-3 (supervised) autonomy on a prostate phantom composed of hydrogel materials that replicate the mechanical and cutting properties of tissue. As a feasibility study, we demonstrate that our combined autonomous system achieves a 97.1% resection of the targeted volume of the median lobe.

Our approach yields explainable counterfactuals in a non-generative manner by quantifying similarity and weighting component contributions within regions of interest between correctly classified and misclassified samples.

WSTL learning problems, when implemented naively, lead to multi-linear constraints in the weights to be learned. By introducing structural pruning and log-transform procedures, we reduce the problem size and recast the problem as a Mixed-Integer Linear Program while preserving safety guarantees. Experiments on robotic navigation and real-world Formula 1 data demonstrate that the method effectively captures nuanced preferences and models complex task objectives.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u52a0\u6743\u4fe1\u53f7\u65f6\u5e8f\u903b\u8f91\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u504f\u597d\u3001\u6392\u540d\u6216\u6f14\u793a\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u526a\u679d\u548c\u5bf9\u6570\u53d8\u6362\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u6df7\u5408\u6574\u6570\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u80fd\u9002\u5e94\u884c\u4e3a\u53c8\u80fd\u786e\u4fdd\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u52a0\u6743\u4fe1\u53f7\u65f6\u5e8f\u903b\u8f91\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u526a\u679d\u548c\u5bf9\u6570\u53d8\u6362\u5c06\u591a\u7ebf\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u6df7\u5408\u6574\u6570\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5bfc\u822a\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754cF1\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u7ec6\u5fae\u504f\u597d\u5e76\u5efa\u6a21\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3001\u6700\u4f18\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u504f\u597d\u3001\u6392\u540d\u548c\u6f14\u793a\u6570\u636e\u3002"}}

However, existing legal benchmarks often conflate factual recall with genuine inference, fragment the reasoning process, and overlook the quality of reasoning. To address these limitations, we introduce MSLR, the first Chinese multi-step legal reasoning dataset grounded in real-world judicial decision making. MSLR adopts the IRAC framework (Issue, Rule, Application, Conclusion) to model structured expert reasoning from official legal documents. In addition, we design a scalable Human-LLM collaborative annotation pipeline that efficiently produces fine-grained step-level reasoning annotations and provides a reusable methodological framework for multi-step reasoning datasets. Evaluation of multiple LLMs on MSLR shows only moderate performance, highlighting the challenges of adapting to complex legal reasoning. Further experiments demonstrate that Self-Initiated Chain-of-Thought prompts generated by models autonomously improve reasoning coherence and quality, outperforming human-designed prompts. MSLR contributes to advancing LLM reasoning and Chain-of-Thought strategies and offers open resources for future research.

While recent rectified flow approaches have advanced visuomotor policy learning, they suffer from a key limitation: After iterative distillation, generated actions may deviate from the ground-truth actions corresponding to the current visual observation, leading to accumulated error as the reflow process repeats and unstable task execution. We present Selective Flow Alignment (SeFA), an efficient and accurate visuomotor policy learning framework. SeFA resolves this challenge by a selective flow alignment strategy, which leverages expert demonstrations to selectively correct generated actions and restore consistency with observations, while preserving multimodality. This design introduces a consistency correction mechanism that ensures generated actions remain observation-aligned without sacrificing the efficiency of one-step flow inference. Extensive experiments across both simulated and real-world manipulation tasks show that SeFA Policy surpasses state-of-the-art diffusion-based and flow-based policies, achieving superior accuracy and robustness while reducing inference latency by over 98%. By unifying rectified flow efficiency with observation-consistent action generation, SeFA provides a scalable and dependable solution for real-time visuomotor policy learning.

While manually crafting CQs can be highly time-consuming and costly for ontology engineers, recent studies have explored the use of large language models (LLMs) to automate this process. However, prior approaches have largely evaluated generated CQs based on their similarity to existing datasets, which often fail to verify semantic pitfalls such as \"Misusing allValuesFrom\". Since such pitfalls cannot be reliably detected through rule-based methods, we propose a novel dataset and model of Validating Semantic Pitfalls in Ontology (VSPO) for CQ generation specifically designed to verify the semantic pitfalls. To simulate missing and misused axioms, we use LLMs to generate natural language definitions of classes and properties and introduce misalignments between the definitions and the ontology by removing axioms or altering logical operators (e.g., substituting union with intersection). We then fine-tune LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct to generate CQs that validate these semantic discrepancies between the provided definitions and the corresponding axioms. The resulting CQs can detect a broader range of modeling errors compared to existing public datasets. Our fine-tuned model demonstrates superior performance over baselines, showing 26% higher precision and 28.2% higher recall than GPT-4.1 in generating CQs for pitfall validation. This research enables automatic generation of TBox-validating CQs using LLMs, significantly reducing manual effort while improving semantic alignment between ontologies and expert knowledge.

How to enhance the logical expressive power of GNNs is still a key issue. Motivated by this, we propose Path-Neighbor enhanced GNN (PN-GNN), a method to enhance the logical expressive power of GNN by aggregating node-neighbor embeddings on the reasoning path. First, we analyze the logical expressive power of existing GNN-based methods and point out the shortcomings of the expressive power of these methods. Then, we theoretically investigate the logical expressive power of PN-GNN, showing that it not only has strictly stronger expressive power than C-GNN but also that its $(k+1)$-hop logical expressiveness is strictly superior to that of $k$-hop. Finally, we evaluate the logical expressive power of PN-GNN on six synthetic datasets and two real-world datasets.

This problem is particularly important in machine learning involving high-dimensional, multimodal data such as social media, bioinformatics or recommendation systems. Existing Multi-View Multi-Label Feature Selection (MVMLFS) methods mainly focus on analyzing statistical information of data, but seldom consider semantic information. In this paper, we aim to use these two types of information jointly and propose a method that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) semantic reasoning with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) structural modeling for MVMLFS. Specifically, the method consists of three main components. (1) LLM is first used as an evaluation agent to assess the latent semantic relevance among feature, view, and label descriptions.

To explore this issue, we propose a new perturbation framework to evaluate LLMs' reasoning ability in complex environments by injecting additional semantically irrelevant perturbation sentences and gradually increasing the perturbation intensity. At the same time, we use an additional perturbation method: core questioning instruction missing, to further analyze the LLMs' problem-solving mechanism. The experimental results show that LLMs perform stably when facing perturbation sentences without numbers, but there is also a robustness boundary. As the perturbation intensity increases, the performance exhibits varying degrees of decline; when facing perturbation sentences with numbers, the performance decreases more significantly, most open source models with smaller parameters decrease by nearly or even more than 10%, and further increasing with the enhancement of perturbation intensity, with the maximum decrease reaching 51.55%. Even the most advanced commercial LLMs have seen a 3%-10% performance drop. By analyzing the reasoning process of LLMs in detail, We find that models are more sensitive to perturbations with numerical information and are more likely to give incorrect answers when disturbed by irrelevant numerical information. The higher the perturbation intensity, the more obvious these defects are. At the same time, in the absence of core questioning instruction, models can still maintain an accuracy of 20%-40%, indicating that LLMs may rely on memory templates or pattern matching to complete the task, rather than logical reasoning. In general, our work reveals the shortcomings and limitations of current LLMs in their reasoning capabilities, which is of great significance for the further development of LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u5165\u8bed\u4e49\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u53e5\u5b50\u5e76\u9010\u6b65\u589e\u52a0\u6270\u52a8\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0LLM\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u6570\u5b57\u6270\u52a8\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4e14\u53ef\u80fd\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6a21\u677f\u800c\u975e\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22LLM\u662f\u5426\u771f\u6b63\u5177\u5907\u6570\u5b66\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5f53\u524dLLM\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\u548c\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6ce8\u5165\u8bed\u4e49\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u53e5\u5b50\u548c\u9010\u6b65\u589e\u52a0\u6270\u52a8\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u6838\u5fc3\u63d0\u95ee\u6307\u4ee4\u7f3a\u5931\u7684\u989d\u5916\u6270\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be6\u7ec6\u5206\u6790LLM\u7684\u89e3\u9898\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "LLM\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u65e0\u6570\u5b57\u6270\u52a8\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8fb9\u754c\uff1b\u9762\u5bf9\u6709\u6570\u5b57\u6270\u52a8\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u964d\u8fd110%\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff0c\u6700\u5927\u4e0b\u964d\u8fbe51.55%\uff1b\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u5546\u4e1aLLM\u4e5f\u67093%-10%\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u5728\u6838\u5fc3\u63d0\u95ee\u6307\u4ee4\u7f3a\u5931\u65f6\u4ecd\u80fd\u4fdd\u630120%-40%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u5bf9\u542b\u6570\u5b57\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u66f4\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u5728\u65e0\u5173\u6570\u5b57\u4fe1\u606f\u5e72\u6270\u4e0b\u7ed9\u51fa\u9519\u8bef\u7b54\u6848\uff1b\u53ef\u80fd\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6a21\u677f\u6216\u6a21\u5f0f\u5339\u914d\u800c\u975e\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u5b8c\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\uff1b\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524dLLM\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\u548c\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5bf9LLM\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u53d1\u5c55\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

While large language models(LLMs) show promise in such tasks, their application to biomolecular problems is hindered by logical inconsistencies and the lack of grounding in domain knowledge. Existing approaches often exacerbate these issues: reasoning steps may deviate from biological facts or fail to capture long mechanistic dependencies. To address these challenges, we propose a Knowledge-Augmented Long-CoT Reasoning framework that integrates LLMs with knowledge graph-based multi-hop reasoning chains. The framework constructs mechanistic chains via guided multi-hop traversal and pruning on the knowledge graph; these chains are then incorporated into supervised fine-tuning to improve factual grounding and further refined with reinforcement learning to enhance reasoning reliability and consistency. Furthermore, to overcome the shortcomings of existing benchmarks, which are often restricted in scale and scope and lack annotations for deep reasoning chains, we introduce PrimeKGQA, a comprehensive benchmark for biomolecular question answering. Experimental results on both PrimeKGQA and existing datasets demonstrate that although larger closed-source models still perform well on relatively simple tasks, our method demonstrates clear advantages as reasoning depth increases, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multi-hop tasks that demand traversal of structured biological knowledge.

Traditional LLM benchmarks suffer from training data contamination and fail to measure agentic capabilities such as multi-step tool use and decision-making under uncertainty. We present the Kamiwaza Agentic Merit Index (KAMI) v0.1, an enterprise-focused benchmark that addresses both contamination resistance and agentic evaluation. Through 170,000 LLM test items processing over 5.5 billion tokens across 35 model configurations, we demonstrate that traditional benchmark rankings poorly predict practical agentic performance. Notably, newer generation models like Llama 4 or Qwen 3 do not always outperform their older generation variants on enterprise-relevant tasks, contradicting traditional benchmark trends. We also present insights on cost-performance tradeoffs, model-specific behavioral patterns, and the impact of reasoning capabilities on token efficiency -- findings critical for enterprises making deployment decisions.", "AI": {"tldr": "KAMI v0.1\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9762\u5411\u4f01\u4e1a\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53AI\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfLLM\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6c61\u67d3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u6b65\u9aa4\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u51b3\u7b56\u7b49\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f01\u4e1a\u91c7\u7528\u667a\u80fd\u4f53AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u8981\u80fd\u591f\u53cd\u6620\u771f\u5b9e\u90e8\u7f72\u573a\u666f\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f20\u7edfLLM\u57fa\u51c6\u5b58\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6c61\u67d3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u8861\u91cf\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86Kamiwaza\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4ef7\u503c\u6307\u6570(KAMI)v0.1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5904\u7406170,000\u4e2aLLM\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9879\u3001\u8d85\u8fc755\u4ebf\u4e2atoken\u3001\u6db5\u76d635\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u914d\u7f6e\u6765\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u51c6\u6392\u540d\u65e0\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u5b9e\u9645\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u65b0\u4e00\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u5982Llama 4\u6216Qwen 3\u5728\u4f01\u4e1a\u76f8\u5173\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5e76\u4e0d\u603b\u662f\u4f18\u4e8e\u65e7\u7248\u672c\uff0c\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u51c6\u8d8b\u52bf\u76f8\u77db\u76fe\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u4f01\u4e1a\u90e8\u7f72\u51b3\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6210\u672c-\u6027\u80fd\u6743\u8861\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u7279\u5b9a\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\u4ee5\u53ca\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u5bf9token\u6548\u7387\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

However, the key research question of identifying reasoning steps that balance complexity and computational efficiency remains unsolved. Recent research has increasingly drawn upon psychological theories to explore strategies for optimizing cognitive pathways. The LLM's final outputs and intermediate steps are regarded as System 1 and System 2, respectively. However, an in-depth exploration of the System 2 reasoning is still lacking. Therefore, we propose a novel psychologically backed Scaffold Reasoning framework for code debugging, which encompasses the Scaffold Stream, Analytic Stream, and Integration Stream. The construction of reference code within the Scaffold Stream is integrated with the buggy code analysis results produced by the Analytic Stream through the Integration Stream. Our framework achieves an 88.91% pass rate and an average inference time of 5.36 seconds per-problem on DebugBench, outperforming other reasoning approaches across various LLMs in both reasoning accuracy and efficiency. Further analyses elucidate the advantages and limitations of various cognitive pathways across varying problem difficulties and bug types.

Existing methods generally suffer from limited scalability, weak semantic preservation, and high costs. Therefore, we propose MSCR, an automated adversarial attack method based on multi-source candidate replacement. By combining three information sources including cosine similarity in the embedding space of LLMs, the WordNet dictionary, and contextual predictions from a masked language model, we generate for each word in the input question a set of semantically similar candidates, which are then filtered and substituted one by one to carry out the attack. We conduct large-scale experiments on LLMs using the GSM8K and MATH500 benchmarks. The results show that even a slight perturbation involving only a single word can significantly reduce the accuracy of all models, with the maximum drop reaching 49.89% on GSM8K and 35.40% on MATH500, while preserving the high semantic consistency of the perturbed questions. Further analysis reveals that perturbations not only lead to incorrect outputs but also substantially increase the average response length, which results in more redundant reasoning paths and higher computational resource consumption.

The widespread adoption of test-time scaling further aggravates the tension between model capability and resource consumption, highlighting the importance of inference efficiency. However, a unified metric that accurately reflects an LLM's efficiency across different model sizes and architectures remains absent. Motivated by the correlation between compression and intelligence, we introduce information capacity, a measure of model efficiency based on text compression performance relative to computational complexity. Larger models can predict the next token more accurately, achieving greater compression gains but at higher computational costs. Empirical evaluations on mainstream open-source models show that models of varying sizes within a series exhibit consistent information capacity. This metric enables a fair efficiency comparison across model series and accurate performance prediction within a model series.

Anomaly detection in this type of data constitutes a challenging problem yet with numerous applications in science and engineering because anomaly scores come from the simultaneous consideration of the temporal and variable relationships. In this paper, we propose a clustering-based approach to detect anomalies concerning the amplitude and the shape of multivariate time series. First, we use a sliding window to generate a set of multivariate subsequences and thereafter apply an extended fuzzy clustering to reveal a structure present within the generated multivariate subsequences. Finally, a reconstruction criterion is employed to reconstruct the multivariate subsequences with the optimal cluster centers and the partition matrix. We construct a confidence index to quantify a level of anomaly detected in the series and apply Particle Swarm Optimization as an optimization vehicle for the problem of anomaly detection. Experimental studies completed on several synthetic and six real-world datasets suggest that the proposed methods can detect the anomalies in multivariate time series. With the help of available clusters revealed by the extended fuzzy clustering, the proposed framework can detect anomalies in the multivariate time series and is suitable for identifying anomalous amplitude and shape patterns in various application domains such as health care, weather data analysis, finance, and disease outbreak detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u805a\u7c7b\u7684\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u751f\u6210\u5b50\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6269\u5c55\u6a21\u7cca\u805a\u7c7b\u5206\u6790\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u5f62\u72b6\u5f02\u5e38\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7c92\u5b50\u7fa4\u4f18\u5316\u8fdb\u884c\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u9700\u8981\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u53d8\u91cf\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u6784\u6210\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u751f\u6210\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u5b50\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u6269\u5c55\u6a21\u7cca\u805a\u7c7b\u63ed\u793a\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u91cd\u6784\u51c6\u5219\u548c\u7c92\u5b50\u7fa4\u4f18\u5316\u8fdb\u884c\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5408\u6210\u548c\u516d\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u68c0\u6d4b\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u533b\u7597\u3001\u5929\u6c14\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u3001\u91d1\u878d\u548c\u75be\u75c5\u7206\u53d1\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u3002"}}

Through iterative experimentation with different proportions of synthetic data, we attempt to find an optimal balance that maximizes the benefits of synthetic data while preserving the authenticity and relevance of real data. Our results suggest that the inclusion of synthetic data improves the model's ability to handle different scenarios, with potential practical industrial applications to reduce manual labor, machine use, and material waste. This approach provides a valuable alternative for situations where extensive data collection and maintenance has been impractical or costly and thus could contribute to more efficient manufacturing processes in the future.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5728\u6ce8\u5851\u6210\u578b\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7LSTM\u67b6\u6784\u7ed3\u5408\u6a21\u62df\u751f\u4ea7\u5468\u671f\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u6765\u6539\u5584\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5de5\u4e1a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u96c6\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u8017\u65f6\uff0c\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u8db3\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u751f\u4ea7\u5468\u671f\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u4ee5\u4e0d\u540c\u6bd4\u4f8b\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u6df7\u5408\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u73b0\u6709\u7684LSTM\u67b6\u6784\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5bfb\u627e\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "result": "\u5305\u542b\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u540c\u573a\u666f\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u51cf\u5c11\u4eba\u5de5\u52b3\u52a8\u3001\u673a\u5668\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u6750\u6599\u6d6a\u8d39\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u96c6\u548c\u7ef4\u62a4\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u672a\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5236\u9020\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002"}}

Speech-based assessments show promise for early detection, as phonetic motor planning deficits alter acoustic features (e.g., pitch, tone), while memory and language impairments lead to syntactic and semantic errors. However, conventional speech-processing pipelines with hand-crafted features or general-purpose audio classifiers often exhibit limited performance and generalizability. To address these limitations, we introduce SpeechCARE, a multimodal speech processing pipeline that leverages pretrained, multilingual acoustic and linguistic transformer models to capture subtle speech-related cues associated with cognitive impairment. Inspired by the Mixture of Experts (MoE) paradigm, SpeechCARE employs a dynamic fusion architecture that weights transformer-based acoustic, linguistic, and demographic inputs, allowing integration of additional modalities (e.g., social factors, imaging) and enhancing robustness across diverse tasks. Its robust preprocessing includes automatic transcription, large language model (LLM)-based anomaly detection, and task identification. A SHAP-based explainability module and LLM reasoning highlight each modality's contribution to decision-making. SpeechCARE achieved AUC = 0.88 and F1 = 0.72 for classifying cognitively healthy, MCI, and AD individuals, with AUC = 0.90 and F1 = 0.62 for MCI detection. Bias analysis showed minimal disparities, except for adults over 80. Mitigation techniques included oversampling and weighted loss.

These data are often collected from online sources. This raises serious concerns about the protection of user data, as individuals may not have given consent for their data to be used in training. To address this concern, recent studies introduce the concept of unlearnable examples, i.e., data instances that appear natural but are intentionally altered to prevent models from effectively learning from them. While existing methods demonstrate empirical effectiveness, they typically rely on heuristic trials and lack formal guarantees. Besides, when unlearnable examples are mixed with clean data, as is often the case in practice, their unlearnability disappears. In this work, we propose a novel approach to constructing unlearnable examples by systematically maximising the Bayes error, a measurement of irreducible classification error. We develop an optimisation-based approach and provide an efficient solution using projected gradient ascent. Our method provably increases the Bayes error and remains effective when the unlearning examples are mixed with clean samples. Experimental results across multiple datasets and model architectures are consistent with our theoretical analysis and show that our approach can restrict data learnability, effectively in practice.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u5927\u5316\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u4e0d\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u5e72\u51c0\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u6709\u6548\u6027", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u7528\u6237\u6570\u636e\u4fdd\u62a4\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u672a\u7ecf\u540c\u610f\u7684\u6570\u636e\u88ab\u7528\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e14\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u5e72\u51c0\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u5931\u6548", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6295\u5f71\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5347\u6765\u6700\u5927\u5316\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e0d\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6837\u672c", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u9650\u5236\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e00\u81f4", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6784\u5efa\u4e0d\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u5e72\u51c0\u6570\u636e\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u6709\u6548\u6027"}}

Recent advances in artificial intelligence, particularly large language models (LLMs), have enabled virtual screening methods that reduce costs and improve efficiency. However, the growing complexity of these tools has limited their accessibility to wet-lab researchers. Multi-agent systems offer a promising solution by combining the interpretability of LLMs with the precision of specialized models and tools. In this work, we present MADD, a multi-agent system that builds and executes customized hit identification pipelines from natural language queries. MADD employs four coordinated agents to handle key subtasks in de novo compound generation and screening.

While von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distributions offer a theoretically grounded alternative on the sphere, their reliance on Bessel functions and rejection sampling hinders practical adoption. We propose \\textbf{Geometric Action Control (GAC)}, a novel action generation paradigm that preserves the geometric benefits of spherical distributions while \\textit{simplifying computation}. GAC decomposes action generation into a direction vector and a learnable concentration parameter, enabling efficient interpolation between deterministic actions and uniform spherical noise. This design reduces parameter count from \\(2d\\) to \\(d+1\\), and avoids the \\(O(dk)\\) complexity of vMF rejection sampling, achieving simple \\(O(d)\\) operations. Empirically, GAC consistently matches or exceeds state-of-the-art methods across six MuJoCo benchmarks, achieving 37.6\\% improvement over SAC on Ant-v4 and the best results on 4 out of 6 tasks. Our ablation studies reveal that both \\textbf{spherical normalization} and \\textbf{adaptive concentration control} are essential to GAC's success. These findings suggest that robust and efficient continuous control does not require complex distributions, but a principled respect for the geometry of action spaces.

These metrics fail to capture the quality of an agent's decisions, its operational autonomy, or its ultimate business value. This white paper proposes a novel, comprehensive framework of eleven outcome-based, task-agnostic performance metrics for AI agents that transcend domain boundaries. These metrics are designed to enable organizations to evaluate agents based on the quality of their decisions, their degree of autonomy, their adaptability to new challenges, and the tangible business value they deliver, regardless of the underlying model architecture or specific use case. We introduce metrics such as Goal Completion Rate (GCR), Autonomy Index (AIx), Multi-Step Task Resilience (MTR), and Business Impact Efficiency (BIE). Through a large-scale simulated experiment involving four distinct agent architectures (ReAct, Chain-of-Thought, Tool-Augmented, Hybrid) across five diverse domains (Healthcare, Finance, Marketing, Legal, and Customer Service), we demonstrate the framework's efficacy. Our results reveal significant performance trade-offs between different agent designs, highlighting the Hybrid Agent as the most consistently high-performing model across the majority of our proposed metrics, achieving an average Goal Completion Rate of 88.8\\% and the highest Return on Investment (ROI).

To address these challenges, task-vector-based methods have been explored by inserting compact representations of many-shot in-context demonstrations into model activations. However, existing task-vector-based methods either overlook the importance of where to insert task vectors or struggle to determine suitable values for each location. To this end, we propose a novel Sensitivity-aware Task Vector insertion framework (STV) to figure out where and what to insert. Our key insight is that activation deltas across query-context pairs exhibit consistent structural patterns, providing a reliable cue for insertion. Based on the identified sensitive-aware locations, we construct a pre-clustered activation bank for each location by clustering the activation values, and then apply reinforcement learning to choose the most suitable one to insert. We evaluate STV across a range of multimodal models (e.g., Qwen-VL, Idefics-2) and tasks (e.g., VizWiz, OK-VQA), demonstrating its effectiveness and showing consistent improvements over previous task-vector-based methods with strong generalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86STV\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u654f\u611f\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u5411\u91cf\u63d2\u5165\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u63d2\u5165\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u591a\u6837\u672c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u6709\u9650\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u4efb\u52a1\u5411\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u5ffd\u89c6\u63d2\u5165\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u96be\u4ee5\u786e\u5b9a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u5408\u9002\u503c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u654f\u611f\u611f\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\u5411\u91cf\u63d2\u5165\u6846\u67b6(STV)\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u67e5\u8be2-\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5bf9\u95f4\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5dee\u5f02\u6a21\u5f0f\u8bc6\u522b\u654f\u611f\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u9884\u805a\u7c7b\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5e93\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u5408\u9002\u7684\u63d2\u5165\u503c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b(Qwen-VL\u3001Idefics-2)\u548c\u4efb\u52a1(VizWiz\u3001OK-VQA)\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cSTV\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u4efb\u52a1\u5411\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "STV\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u786e\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u5411\u91cf\u63d2\u5165\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Most existing GraphRAG efforts focus on Resource Description Framework (RDF) knowledge graphs, relying on triple representations and SPARQL queries. However, the potential of Cypher and Labeled Property Graph (LPG) databases to serve as scalable and effective reasoning engines within GraphRAG pipelines remains underexplored in current research literature. To fill this gap, we propose Multi-Agent GraphRAG, a modular LLM agentic system for text-to-Cypher query generation serving as a natural language interface to LPG-based graph data. Our proof-of-concept system features an LLM-based workflow for automated Cypher queries generation and execution, using Memgraph as the graph database backend. Iterative content-aware correction and normalization, reinforced by an aggregated feedback loop, ensures both semantic and syntactic refinement of generated queries. We evaluate our system on the CypherBench graph dataset covering several general domains with diverse types of queries. In addition, we demonstrate performance of the proposed workflow on a property graph derived from the IFC (Industry Foundation Classes) data, representing a digital twin of a building.

Traditional peer-to-peer repositories and developer communities for shared technical knowledge and best practice have witnessed dramatic drops in participation in a short period of time. At the same time, agentic functional equivalents are yet to emerge leaving AI agents, which already generate a significant proportion of all new software code produced, without access to repositories of valuable shared learning.\n  In this paper, we introduce Spark, a novel shared agentic memory architecture which is designed to emulate the collective intelligence and know-how of human developer communities. Spark enables AI coding agents to both contribute to and draw from a persistent and continuously evolving experiential memory. Agents operating in the same general problem space use the Spark shared memory as a repository of new knowledge to achieve collective continual learning. We evaluate Spark as a coach for AI coding agents performing software development tasks. We demonstrate that recommendations made by Spark improve the quality of code generated by generic code generation models at varying sizes and capability tiers. Boosted by Spark, a small open-weights model with 30 billion parameters was able to match the code quality afforded by a much larger state-of-the-art model.

Advanced machine learning algorithms are employed to clean and preprocess the data, analyse its features, and automatically select appropriate visualizations. The system establishes the process of automating AI-based analysis and visualization from the context of data-driven environments, and eliminates the challenge of time-consuming manual data analysis. The combination of a Python Flask backend to access the dataset, paired with a React frontend, provides a robust platform that automatically interacts with Firebase Cloud Storage for numerous data processing and data analysis solutions and real-time sources. Key contributions include automatic and intelligent data cleaning, with imputation for missing values, and detection of outliers, via analysis of the data set. AI solutions to intelligently select features, using four different algorithms, and intelligent title generation and visualization are determined by the attributes of the dataset. These contributions were evaluated using two separate datasets to assess the platform's performance. In the process evaluation, the initial analysis was performed in real-time on datasets as large as 100000 rows, while the cloud-based demand platform scales to meet requests from multiple users and processes them simultaneously.

Following the growing scientific interest in mechanistic interpretability, recent work encoded refusal behavior as a single direction in the model's latent space; e.g., computed as the difference between the centroids of harmful and harmless prompt representations. However, emerging evidence suggests that concepts in LLMs often appear to be encoded as a low-dimensional manifold embedded in the high-dimensional latent space. Motivated by these findings, we propose a novel method leveraging Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) to extract multiple refusal directions. To this end, we first prove that SOMs generalize the prior work's difference-in-means technique. We then train SOMs on harmful prompt representations to identify multiple neurons. By subtracting the centroid of harmless representations from each neuron, we derive a set of multiple directions expressing the refusal concept. We validate our method on an extensive experimental setup, demonstrating that ablating multiple directions from models' internals outperforms not only the single-direction baseline but also specialized jailbreak algorithms, leading to an effective suppression of refusal. Finally, we conclude by analyzing the mechanistic implications of our approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6620\u5c04(SOMs)\u4ece\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u591a\u4e2a\u62d2\u7edd\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5355\u65b9\u5411\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u62d2\u7edd\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5c06\u62d2\u7edd\u884c\u4e3a\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u5355\u4e00\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u4f46\u8bc1\u636e\u8868\u660e\u6982\u5ff5\u5728LLMs\u4e2d\u901a\u5e38\u4ee5\u4f4e\u7ef4\u6d41\u5f62\u5f62\u5f0f\u7f16\u7801\u3002\u53d7\u6b64\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u591a\u4e2a\u62d2\u7edd\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6620\u5c04(SOMs)\u5728\u6709\u5bb3\u63d0\u793a\u8868\u5f81\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u591a\u4e2a\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u6bcf\u4e2a\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u51cf\u53bb\u65e0\u5bb3\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u8d28\u5fc3\u6765\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u591a\u4e2a\u62d2\u7edd\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4ece\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u6d88\u878d\u591a\u4e2a\u65b9\u5411\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u65b9\u5411\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u8fd8\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u8d8a\u72f1\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236\u62d2\u7edd\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u673a\u5236\u542b\u4e49\uff0c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u591a\u4e2a\u62d2\u7edd\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\u7684\u673a\u68b0\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

Building on these insights, we propose FaithAct, a faithfulness-first planning and acting framework that enforces evidential grounding at every reasoning step. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that FaithAct improves perceptual faithfulness by up to 26% without degrading task accuracy compared to prompt-based and tool-augmented baselines.

From researchers choosing which problems to tackle next, to students deciding which ones to engage with, people's choices are often guided by judgments about how interesting or challenging problems are likely to be. As AI systems, such as LLMs, increasingly participate in mathematics with people -- whether for advanced research or education -- it becomes important to understand how well their judgments align with human ones. Our work examines this alignment through two empirical studies of human and LLM assessment of mathematical interestingness and difficulty, spanning a range of mathematical experience. We study two groups: participants from a crowdsourcing platform and International Math Olympiad competitors. We show that while many LLMs appear to broadly agree with human notions of interestingness, they mostly do not capture the distribution observed in human judgments. Moreover, most LLMs only somewhat align with why humans find certain math problems interesting, showing weak correlation with human-selected interestingness rationales. Together, our findings highlight both the promises and limitations of current LLMs in capturing human interestingness judgments for mathematical AI thought partnerships.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86LLMs\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u8da3\u5473\u6027\u548c\u96be\u5ea6\u5224\u65ad\u4e0a\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0LLMs\u867d\u7136\u5927\u81f4\u8ba4\u540c\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u8da3\u5473\u6027\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b8c\u5168\u6355\u6349\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u9009\u62e9\u8da3\u5473\u6027\u7406\u7531\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u8f83\u5f31\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u53c2\u4e0e\u6570\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u6559\u80b2\uff0c\u7406\u89e3LLMs\u7684\u5224\u65ad\u662f\u5426\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u9f50\u53d8\u5f97\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u8da3\u5473\u6027\u548c\u96be\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u9762\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u8c03\u67e5\u4e86\u4f17\u5305\u5e73\u53f0\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u548c\u56fd\u9645\u6570\u5b66\u5965\u6797\u5339\u514b\u7ade\u8d5b\u9009\u624b\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4eba\u7c7b\u548cLLMs\u5bf9\u6570\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u8da3\u5473\u6027\u548c\u96be\u5ea6\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "LLMs\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u8da3\u5473\u6027\u5224\u65ad\u4e0a\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u6709\u5927\u81f4\u5171\u8bc6\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b8c\u5168\u590d\u5236\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u8da3\u5473\u6027\u7406\u7531\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u8f83\u5f31\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524dLLMs\u5728\u6355\u6349\u4eba\u7c7b\u6570\u5b66\u8da3\u5473\u6027\u5224\u65ad\u65b9\u9762\u65e2\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u4e5f\u6709\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6570\u5b66AI\u601d\u7ef4\u5408\u4f5c\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

DPrL parameterizes all derivation steps with neural networks, allowing efficient neural guidance over the proving system. Additionally, we establish a formal mapping between the resolution process of our deep stochastic logic programs and Markov Decision Processes, enabling the application of dynamic programming and reinforcement learning techniques for efficient inference and learning.

These developments point toward the emergence of video foundation models that function not only as visual generators but also as implicit world models, models that simulate the physical dynamics, agent-environment interactions, and task planning that govern real or imagined worlds. This survey provides a systematic overview of this evolution, conceptualizing modern video foundation models as the combination of two core components: an implicit world model and a video renderer. The world model encodes structured knowledge about the world, including physical laws, interaction dynamics, and agent behavior. It serves as a latent simulation engine that enables coherent visual reasoning, long-term temporal consistency, and goal-driven planning. The video renderer transforms this latent simulation into realistic visual observations, effectively producing videos as a \"window\" into the simulated world. We trace the progression of video generation through four generations, in which the core capabilities advance step by step, ultimately culminating in a world model, built upon a video generation model, that embodies intrinsic physical plausibility, real-time multimodal interaction, and planning capabilities spanning multiple spatiotemporal scales. For each generation, we define its core characteristics, highlight representative works, and examine their application domains such as robotics, autonomous driving, and interactive gaming. Finally, we discuss open challenges and design principles for next-generation world models, including the role of agent intelligence in shaping and evaluating these systems.
