Here, we propose and apply a methodology that overcomes this limitation and is able to find and characterize also the different possible unbalanced structures in signed networks. Applying our methodology to 24 empirical networks, from social-political, financial, and biological domains, we find that unbalanced meso-scale structures are prevalent in real-world networks, including cases with substantial balance at the micro-scale of triangles. In particular, we find that assortativity often prevails regardless of the interaction sign and that core-periphery structures are typical in online social networks. Our findings highlight the complexity of meso-scale relational structures, the importance of using computational methods that are a priori agnostic to specific patterns, and the importance of independently evaluating micro- and meso-scale predictions of social balance theory."}

Although popular graph-theoretic methods, such as Louvain, optimize for modularity, they can overlook nuanced, geometric community structures. Conversely, topological data analysis (TDA) methods such as ToMATo are powerful in identifying density-defined clusters in embedded data but can be sensitive to initial projection. We propose a unified framework that integrates both paradigms to take advantage of their complementary advantages. Our method uses spectral embedding to capture the network's geometric skeleton, creating a landscape where communities manifest as density basins. The ToMATo algorithm then provides a topologically-grounded and parameter-aware method to extract persistent clusters from this landscape. Our comprehensive analysis across synthetic benchmarks shows that this hybrid approach is highly robust: it performs on par with Louvain on modular networks. These results argue for a new class of hybrid algorithms that select strategies based on network geometry, moving beyond one-size-fits-all solutions."}

Furthermore, many measures found in the literature do not accurately represent the physical or probabilistic characteristics of nodal centrality, network flow, and other salient properties. For example, recurrent spreading in a network is often overlooked by these metrics. Standard centrality measures have limitations, being optimal for one application but not for others. Here, we present new metrics based on our influence spreading model to characterize network structure for various network science applications. These probabilistic measures account for all feasible walks and cycles in the network. We compare our new metrics with the standard metrics in terms of the node rankings given by different centrality measures, by examining scatter plots, and by using the Pearson correlation coefficient. In the influence spreading model, we define the in-centrality measure to characterize how central a node is as a target of influence by other nodes and the out-centrality measure to characterize how central a node is as a source of influence on other nodes. Our results show that the influence spreading betweenness centrality reveals the importance of alternative routes while maintaining similarity to standard betweenness centrality."}

Although standard explanations focus on demographics, economics, and geography, movement across the city may also depend on cultural styles and amenity mix. This study proposes a relational, cross-national model in which local culture and amenity mix alignment creates a \"soft infrastructure\" of urban mobility, i.e., symbolic cues and functional features that shape expectations about the character of places. Using ~650 million Google Places reviews to measure co-visitation between U.S. ZIP codes and ~30 million Canadian change-of-address to track residential mobility, results show that neighborhoods with similar cultural styles and amenities are significantly more connected. These effects persist even after controlling for race, income, education, politics, housing costs, and distance. Urban cohesion and segregation depend not only on who lives where or how far apart neighborhoods are, but on the shared cultural and material ecologies that structure movement across the city."}

The inherent difficulty of modeling MILPs that accurately represent stochastic real world problems leads to suboptimal performance in the real world. Recently, machine learning methods have been applied to build MILP models for decision quality rather than how accurately they model the real world problem. However, these approaches typically rely on supervised learning, assume access to true optimal decisions, and use surrogates for the MILP gradients. In this work, we introduce a proof of concept CORL framework that end to end fine tunes an MILP scheme using reinforcement learning (RL) on real world data to maximize its operational performance. We enable this by casting an MILP solved by B&B as a differentiable stochastic policy compatible with RL.

Recent work demonstrates that techniques such as repeated sampling, self-verification, and self-reflection can significantly enhance task success by allocating more inference-time compute. However, applying these techniques across multiple agents in a multi-agent system is difficult: there does not exist principled mechanisms to allocate compute to foster collaboration among agents, to extend test-time scaling to collaborative interactions, or to distribute compute across agents under explicit budget constraints. To address this gap, we propose FutureWeaver, a framework for planning and optimizing test-time compute allocation in multi-agent systems under fixed budgets. FutureWeaver introduces modularized collaboration, formalized as callable functions that encapsulate reusable multi-agent workflows. These modules are automatically derived through self-play reflection by abstracting recurring interaction patterns from past trajectories. Building on these modules, FutureWeaver employs a dual-level planning architecture that optimizes compute allocation by reasoning over the current task state while also speculating on future steps. Experiments on complex agent benchmarks demonstrate that FutureWeaver consistently outperforms baselines across diverse budget settings, validating its effectiveness for multi-agent collaboration in inference-time optimization."}

Recently, machine learning methods have been applied to build MILP models for decision quality rather than how accurately they model the real world problem. However, these approaches typically rely on supervised learning, assume access to true optimal decisions, and use surrogates for the MILP gradients. In this work, we introduce a proof of concept CORL framework that end to end fine tunes an MILP scheme using reinforcement learning (RL) on real world data to maximize its operational performance. We enable this by casting an MILP solved by B&B as a differentiable stochastic policy compatible with RL.

We model the OFEX combinatorial bundling problem as a multi-commodity one-to-one pickup-and-delivery selective traveling salesperson problem (m1-PDSTSP), which optimizes revenue-driven freight bundling under capacity, precedence, and route-length constraints. The key challenge is to couple combinatorial bundle selection with pickup-and-delivery routing under sub-second latency. We propose a learning--accelerated hybrid search pipeline that pairs a Transformer Neural Network-based constructive policy with an innovative Multi-Start Large Neighborhood Search (MSLNS) metaheuristic within a rolling-horizon scheme in which the platform repeatedly freezes the current marketplace into a static snapshot and solves it under a short time budget.

Recent work demonstrates that techniques such as repeated sampling, self-verification, and self-reflection can significantly enhance task success by allocating more inference-time compute. However, applying these techniques across multiple agents in a multi-agent system is difficult: there does not exist principled mechanisms to allocate compute to foster collaboration among agents, to extend test-time scaling to collaborative interactions, or to distribute compute across agents under explicit budget constraints. To address this gap, we propose FutureWeaver, a framework for planning and optimizing test-time compute allocation in multi-agent systems under fixed budgets. FutureWeaver introduces modularized collaboration, formalized as callable functions that encapsulate reusable multi-agent workflows. These modules are automatically derived through self-play reflection by abstracting recurring interaction patterns from past trajectories. Building on these modules, FutureWeaver employs a dual-level planning architecture that optimizes compute allocation by reasoning over the current task state while also speculating on future steps. Experiments on complex agent benchmarks demonstrate that FutureWeaver consistently outperforms baselines across diverse budget settings, validating its effectiveness for multi-agent collaboration in inference-time optimization."}

This study proposes a relational, cross-national model in which local culture and amenity mix alignment creates a \"soft infrastructure\" of urban mobility, i.e., symbolic cues and functional features that shape expectations about the character of places. Using ~650 million Google Places reviews to measure co-visitation between U.S. ZIP codes and ~30 million Canadian change-of-address to track residential mobility, results show that neighborhoods with similar cultural styles and amenities are significantly more connected. These effects persist even after controlling for race, income, education, politics, housing costs, and distance. Urban cohesion and segregation depend not only on who lives where or how far apart neighborhoods are, but on the shared cultural and material ecologies that structure movement across the city."}

However, this practice often raises concerns about fairness at both the individual and group levels. At the individual level, a customer may perceive unfair treatment if he/she notices being charged a higher price than others. At the group level, pricing disparities can result in discrimination against certain protected groups, such as those defined by gender or race. Existing studies on fair pricing typically address individual and group fairness separately. This paper bridges the gap by introducing a new formulation of the personalized pricing problem that incorporates both dimensions of fairness in social network settings. To solve the problem, we propose FairPricing, a novel framework based on graph neural networks (GNNs) that learns a personalized pricing policy using customer features and network topology. In FairPricing, individual perceived unfairness is captured through a penalty on customer demand, and thus the profit objective, while group-level discrimination is mitigated using adversarial debiasing and a price regularization term. Unlike existing optimization-based personalized pricing, which requires re-optimization whenever the network updates, the pricing policy learned by FairPricing assigns personalized prices to all customers in an updated network based on their features and the new network structure, thereby generalizing to network changes. Extensive experimental results show that FairPricing achieves high profitability while improving individual fairness perceptions and satisfying group fairness requirements."}

While recent work improves MAS cost-effectiveness by shaping inter-agent communication topologies and selecting agent backbones, it rarely models and optimizes under explicit token-cost and latency budgets that reflect deployment constraints. This often leads to topology-first designs and suboptimal cost-effectiveness when budgets are binding. We present AgentBalance, a framework for constructing cost-effective MAS under explicit token-cost and latency budgets via a backbone-then-topology design. AgentBalance first performs backbone-oriented agent generation, constructing agents with heterogeneous backbones through LLM pool construction, pool selection, and role-backbone matching. It then performs adaptive MAS topology generation, guiding inter-agent communication via agent representation learning, gating, and latency-aware topology synthesis. Experiments on benchmarks with 14 candidate LLM backbones show that AgentBalance achieves up to 10% and 22% performance gains under matched token-cost and latency budgets, respectively, and yields strong AUC on performance-versus-budget curves across benchmarks. AgentBalance also functions as a plug-in for existing MAS, improving performance under the same token-cost and latency constraints, and it generalizes well to unseen LLMs for practical, budget-aware deployment.

These metrics rely on a baseline function to alter the pixels of the input image that the attribution map deems most important. In this work, we highlight a critical problem with these metrics: the choice of a given baseline will inevitably favour certain attribution methods over others. More concerningly, even a simple linear model with commonly used baselines contradicts itself by designating different optimal methods. A question then arises: which baseline should we use? We propose to study this problem through two desirable properties of a baseline: (i) that it removes information and (ii) that it does not produce overly out-of-distribution (OOD) images. We first show that none of the tested baselines satisfy both criteria, and there appears to be a trade-off among current baselines: either they remove information or they produce a sequence of OOD images. Finally, we introduce a novel baseline by leveraging recent work in feature visualisation to artificially produce a model-dependent baseline that removes information without being overly OOD, thus improving on the trade-off when compared to other existing baselines.

While recent work improves MAS cost-effectiveness by shaping inter-agent communication topologies and selecting agent backbones, it rarely models and optimizes under explicit token-cost and latency budgets that reflect deployment constraints. This often leads to topology-first designs and suboptimal cost-effectiveness when budgets are binding. We present AgentBalance, a framework for constructing cost-effective MAS under explicit token-cost and latency budgets via a backbone-then-topology design. AgentBalance first performs backbone-oriented agent generation, constructing agents with heterogeneous backbones through LLM pool construction, pool selection, and role-backbone matching. It then performs adaptive MAS topology generation, guiding inter-agent communication via agent representation learning, gating, and latency-aware topology synthesis. Experiments on benchmarks with 14 candidate LLM backbones show that AgentBalance achieves up to 10% and 22% performance gains under matched token-cost and latency budgets, respectively, and yields strong AUC on performance-versus-budget curves across benchmarks. AgentBalance also functions as a plug-in for existing MAS, improving performance under the same token-cost and latency constraints, and it generalizes well to unseen LLMs for practical, budget-aware deployment.

These metrics rely on a baseline function to alter the pixels of the input image that the attribution map deems most important. In this work, we highlight a critical problem with these metrics: the choice of a given baseline will inevitably favour certain attribution methods over others. More concerningly, even a simple linear model with commonly used baselines contradicts itself by designating different optimal methods. A question then arises: which baseline should we use? We propose to study this problem through two desirable properties of a baseline: (i) that it removes information and (ii) that it does not produce overly out-of-distribution (OOD) images. We first show that none of the tested baselines satisfy both criteria, and there appears to be a trade-off among current baselines: either they remove information or they produce a sequence of OOD images. Finally, we introduce a novel baseline by leveraging recent work in feature visualisation to artificially produce a model-dependent baseline that removes information without being overly OOD, thus improving on the trade-off when compared to other existing baselines.

While classical methods like Integer Linear Programming (ILP) guarantee optimal solutions, they face exponential scaling with grid size, and recent advances in machine learning offer promising alternatives for pattern-based approximation. This paper presents the first systematic comparison of classical optimization and AI approaches to this problem, evaluating their performance against traditional algorithms. We apply PatternBoost transformer learning and reinforcement learning (PPO) to this problem for the first time, comparing them against ILP. ILP achieves provably optimal solutions up to 19 by 19 grids, while PatternBoost matches optimal performance up to 14 by 14 grids with 96% test loss reduction. PPO achieves perfect solutions on 10 by 10 grids but fails at 11 by 11 grids, where constraint violations prevent valid configurations. These results demonstrate that classical optimization remains essential for exact solutions while AI methods offer competitive performance on smaller instances, with hybrid approaches presenting the most promising direction for scaling to larger problem sizes."}

For nine globally limiting pests, weeds, and plant diseases, we assessed the factual accuracy, data consistency, and breadth of knowledge or data completeness of each LLM. Overall, DeepSeek consistently screened a 4.8-49.7-fold larger literature corpus and reported 1.6-2.4-fold more biological control agents or management solutions than ChatGPT. As a result, DeepSeek reported 21.6% higher efficacy estimates, exhibited greater laboratory-to-field data consistency, and showed more realistic effects of pest identity and management tactics. However, both models hallucinated, i.e., fabricated fictitious agents or references, reported on implausible ecological interactions or outcomes, confused old and new scientific nomenclatures, and omitted data on key agents or solutions. Despite these shortcomings, both LLMs correctly reported low-resolution efficacy trends. Overall, when paired with rigorous human oversight, LLMs may pose a powerful tool to support farm-level decision-making and unleash scientific creativity."}

Tasks such as drug recommendation, treatment planning, and adverse-effect prediction demand robust, multi-step reasoning grounded in reliable biomedical knowledge. Agentic AI methods, exemplified by TxAgent, address these challenges through iterative retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). TxAgent employs a fine-tuned Llama-3.1-8B model that dynamically generates and executes function calls to a unified biomedical tool suite (ToolUniverse), integrating FDA Drug API, OpenTargets, and Monarch resources to ensure access to current therapeutic information. In contrast to general-purpose RAG systems, medical applications impose stringent safety constraints, rendering the accuracy of both the reasoning trace and the sequence of tool invocations critical. These considerations motivate evaluation protocols treating token-level reasoning and tool-usage behaviors as explicit supervision signals.

Although popular graph-theoretic methods, such as Louvain, optimize for modularity, they can overlook nuanced, geometric community structures. Conversely, topological data analysis (TDA) methods such as ToMATo are powerful in identifying density-defined clusters in embedded data but can be sensitive to initial projection. We propose a unified framework that integrates both paradigms to take advantage of their complementary advantages. Our method uses spectral embedding to capture the network's geometric skeleton, creating a landscape where communities manifest as density basins. The ToMATo algorithm then provides a topologically-grounded and parameter-aware method to extract persistent clusters from this landscape. Our comprehensive analysis across synthetic benchmarks shows that this hybrid approach is highly robust: it performs on par with Louvain on modular networks. These results argue for a new class of hybrid algorithms that select strategies based on network geometry, moving beyond one-size-fits-all solutions."}

The history of the current passing through the coil is remembered by the magnetization inside the magnetic core. Such a meminductor can play a unique role (that cannot be played by a memristor) in neuromorphic computing, deep learning and brain inspired since the time constant of a neuromorphic RLC circuit is jointly determined by the inductance and capacitance, rather than the resistance.

Furthermore, many measures found in the literature do not accurately represent the physical or probabilistic characteristics of nodal centrality, network flow, and other salient properties. For example, recurrent spreading in a network is often overlooked by these metrics. Standard centrality measures have limitations, being optimal for one application but not for others. Here, we present new metrics based on our influence spreading model to characterize network structure for various network science applications. These probabilistic measures account for all feasible walks and cycles in the network. We compare our new metrics with the standard metrics in terms of the node rankings given by different centrality measures, by examining scatter plots, and by using the Pearson correlation coefficient. In the influence spreading model, we define the in-centrality measure to characterize how central a node is as a target of influence by other nodes and the out-centrality measure to characterize how central a node is as a source of influence on other nodes. Our results show that the influence spreading betweenness centrality reveals the importance of alternative routes while maintaining similarity to standard betweenness centrality."}

The model also demonstrates strong robustness, as the\n  cross-validation across two years of data yields an average MAPE of 3.88 percent."}

Although standard explanations focus on demographics, economics, and geography, movement across the city may also depend on cultural styles and amenity mix. This study proposes a relational, cross-national model in which local culture and amenity mix alignment creates a \"soft infrastructure\" of urban mobility, i.e., symbolic cues and functional features that shape expectations about the character of places. Using ~650 million Google Places reviews to measure co-visitation between U.S. ZIP codes and ~30 million Canadian change-of-address to track residential mobility, results show that neighborhoods with similar cultural styles and amenities are significantly more connected. These effects persist even after controlling for race, income, education, politics, housing costs, and distance. Urban cohesion and segregation depend not only on who lives where or how far apart neighborhoods are, but on the shared cultural and material ecologies that structure movement across the city."}

Tasks such as drug recommendation, treatment planning, and adverse-effect prediction demand robust, multi-step reasoning grounded in reliable biomedical knowledge. Agentic AI methods, exemplified by TxAgent, address these challenges through iterative retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). TxAgent employs a fine-tuned Llama-3.1-8B model that dynamically generates and executes function calls to a unified biomedical tool suite (ToolUniverse), integrating FDA Drug API, OpenTargets, and Monarch resources to ensure access to current therapeutic information. In contrast to general-purpose RAG systems, medical applications impose stringent safety constraints, rendering the accuracy of both the reasoning trace and the sequence of tool invocations critical. These considerations motivate evaluation protocols treating token-level reasoning and tool-usage behaviors as explicit supervision signals. This work presents insights derived from our participation in the CURE-Bench NeurIPS 2025 Challenge, which benchmarks therapeutic-reasoning systems using metrics that assess correctness, tool utilization, and reasoning quality. We analyze how retrieval quality for function (tool) calls influences overall model performance and demonstrate performance gains achieved through improved tool-retrieval strategies.

However, the relative impact of these methods during the learning and post-learning phases remains unclear. In this work, we present a large-scale study comparing the effectiveness of various intervention methods in elementary programming both during learning and on novel tasks post-learning. Specifically, we compare three intervention methods: code-edit recommendations (Code-Rec), quizzes based on code edits (Code-Quiz), and quizzes based on metacognitive strategies (Plan-Quiz), along with a no-intervention control (group None). A total of 398 students (across grades 4-7) participated in a two-phase study: learning phase comprising write-code tasks from the Hour of Code: Maze Challenge with the intervention, followed by a post-learning phase comprising more advanced write-code tasks without any intervention. All intervention methods significantly improved learning performance over the control group while preserving students' problem-solving skills in the post-learning phase. Quiz-based methods further improved performance on novel post-learning tasks. Students in intervention groups also reported greater engagement and perceived skill growth."}

Existing approaches vary in their flexibility, interpretability, scalability, and support for diverse outcome types, often limiting their utility in real-world applications. To address these limitations, we propose a neural network-based partial-linear single-index (NeuralPLSI) modeling framework that bridges semiparametric regression modeling interpretability with the expressive power of deep learning. The NeuralPLSI model constructs an interpretable exposure index via a learnable projection and models its relationship with the outcome through a flexible neural network. The framework accommodates continuous, binary, and time-to-event outcomes, and supports inference through a bootstrap-based procedure that yields confidence intervals for key model parameters. We evaluated NeuralPLSI through simulation studies under a range of scenarios and applied it to data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) to demonstrate its practical utility. Together, our contributions establish NeuralPLSI as a scalable, interpretable, and versatile modeling tool for mixture analysis. To promote adoption and reproducibility, we release a user-friendly open-source software package that implements the proposed methodology and supports downstream visualization and inference (\\texttt{https://github.com/hyungrok-do/NeuralPLSI})."}
