Recent advances in deep learning, natural language processing, and multi-omics integration make it possible to understand and optimize food systems with unprecedented depth. However, AI adoption across the food sector remains uneven due to heterogeneous datasets, limited model and system interoperability, and a persistent skills gap between data scientists and food domain experts. To address these challenges and advance responsible innovation, the AI Institute for Next Generation Food Systems (AIFS) convened the inaugural AI for Food Product Development Symposium at University of California, Davis, in October 2025. This white paper synthesizes insights from the symposium, organized around five domains where AI can have the greatest near-term impact: supply chain; formulation and processing; consumer insights and sensory prediction; nutrition and health; and education and workforce development. Across the areas, participants emphasized the importance of interoperable data standards, transparent and interpretable models, and cross-sector collaboration to accelerate the translation of AI research into practice. The discussions further highlighted the need for robust digital infrastructure, privacy-preserving data-sharing mechanisms, and interdisciplinary training pathways that integrate AI literacy with domain expertise. Collectively, the priorities outline a roadmap for integrating AI into food manufacturing in ways that enhance innovation, sustainability, and human well-being while ensuring that technological progress remains grounded in ethics, scientific rigor, and societal benefit.", "AI": {"tldr": "AI\u5728\u98df\u54c1\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6b63\u5728\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u6784\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u5dee\u548c\u6280\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u3002AIFS\u7814\u8ba8\u4f1a\u63d0\u51faAI\u5728\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u3001\u914d\u65b9\u52a0\u5de5\u3001\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u6d1e\u5bdf\u3001\u8425\u517b\u5065\u5eb7\u548c\u4eba\u624d\u57f9\u517b\u4e94\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8def\u7ebf\u56fe\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a8\u52a8AI\u5728\u98df\u54c1\u884c\u4e1a\u7684\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u521b\u65b0\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u6784\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u5dee\u548c\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u5bb6\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6280\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u52a0\u901fAI\u7814\u7a76\u5411\u5b9e\u8df5\u7684\u8f6c\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7AIFS\u5728\u52a0\u5dde\u5927\u5b66\u6234\u7ef4\u65af\u5206\u6821\u4e3e\u529e\u7684AI\u98df\u54c1\u4ea7\u54c1\u5f00\u53d1\u7814\u8ba8\u4f1a\uff0c\u56f4\u7ed5\u4e94\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u9886\u57df\u6536\u96c6\u4e13\u5bb6\u89c1\u89e3\uff1a\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u3001\u914d\u65b9\u52a0\u5de5\u3001\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u6d1e\u5bdf\u4e0e\u611f\u5b98\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u8425\u517b\u5065\u5eb7\u3001\u6559\u80b2\u53ca\u4eba\u624d\u57f9\u517b\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u8ba8\u4f1a\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86AI\u5728\u98df\u54c1\u5236\u9020\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u5148\u5e94\u7528\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u8981\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u6570\u636e\u6807\u51c6\u3001\u900f\u660e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u8de8\u90e8\u95e8\u5408\u4f5c\u3001\u5f3a\u5927\u6570\u5b57\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u6570\u636e\u5171\u4eab\u673a\u5236\u548c\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u57f9\u8bad\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5236\u5b9a\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c06AI\u6574\u5408\u5230\u98df\u54c1\u5236\u9020\u7684\u8def\u7ebf\u56fe\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u589e\u5f3a\u521b\u65b0\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u798f\u7949\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u786e\u4fdd\u6280\u672f\u8fdb\u6b65\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f26\u7406\u3001\u79d1\u5b66\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u6548\u76ca\u3002"}}

Researcher efforts have sought to understand the limitations and potential for harm of generative AI, which we contribute to here. Conducting a systematic review of six AI-powered chat systems (ChatGPT 3.5; ChatGPT 4 Mini; Microsoft Copilot in Bing; Google Search AI; Perplexity; and Grok in Twitter/X), this study examines how these leading products respond to questions related to conspiracy theories. This follows the platform policy implementation audit approach established by Glazunova et al. (2023). We select five well-known and comprehensively debunked conspiracy theories and four emerging conspiracy theories that relate to breaking news events at the time of data collection. Our findings demonstrate that the extent of safety guardrails against conspiratorial ideation in generative AI chatbots differs markedly, depending on chatbot model and conspiracy theory. Our observations indicate that safety guardrails in AI chatbots are often very selectively designed: generative AI companies appear to focus especially on ensuring that their products are not seen to be racist; they also appear to pay particular attention to conspiracy theories that address topics of substantial national trauma such as 9/11 or relate to well-established political issues. Future work should include an ongoing effort extended to further platforms, multiple languages, and a range of conspiracy theories extending well beyond the United States.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5bf96\u4e2a\u4e3b\u6d41AI\u804a\u5929\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5ba1\u67e5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5b83\u4eec\u5bf9\u9634\u8c0b\u8bba\u76f8\u5173\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u56de\u5e94\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u62a4\u680f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u79cd\u65cf\u4e3b\u4e49\u548c\u91cd\u5927\u56fd\u5bb6\u521b\u4f24\u76f8\u5173\u8bae\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740AI\u804a\u5929\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e5\u76ca\u666e\u53ca\u5e76\u5d4c\u5165\u5404\u79cd\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u4e86\u89e3\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5728\u9650\u5236\u6f5c\u5728\u5371\u5bb3\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9488\u5bf9\u9634\u8c0b\u8bba\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528Glazunova\u7b49\u4eba\u5efa\u7acb\u7684\u5e73\u53f0\u653f\u7b56\u5b9e\u65bd\u5ba1\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5ba1\u67e56\u4e2aAI\u804a\u5929\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf95\u4e2a\u77e5\u540d\u9634\u8c0b\u8bba\u548c4\u4e2a\u65b0\u5174\u9634\u8c0b\u8bba\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u56de\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0AI\u804a\u5929\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b89\u5168\u62a4\u680f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u79cd\u65cf\u4e3b\u4e49\u548c\u91cd\u5927\u56fd\u5bb6\u521b\u4f24\u76f8\u5173\u8bae\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u5bf9\u5176\u4ed6\u7c7b\u578b\u9634\u8c0b\u8bba\u7684\u9632\u62a4\u76f8\u5bf9\u8584\u5f31\u3002", "conclusion": "AI\u516c\u53f8\u5e94\u6269\u5c55\u5b89\u5168\u62a4\u680f\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u9700\u8981\u6db5\u76d6\u66f4\u591a\u5e73\u53f0\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u5168\u7403\u8303\u56f4\u7684\u9634\u8c0b\u8bba\u7c7b\u578b\u3002"}}

While governments seek greater control over it, the very foundations of AI--global data pipelines, semiconductor supply chains, open-source ecosystems, and international standards--resist enclosure. This paper develops a conceptual and formal framework for understanding sovereign AI as a continuum rather than a binary condition, balancing autonomy with interdependence. Drawing on classical theories, historical analogies, and contemporary debates on networked autonomy, we present a planner's model that identifies two policy heuristics: equalizing marginal returns across the four sovereignty pillars and setting openness where global benefits equal exposure risks.\n  We apply the model to India, highlighting sovereign footholds in data, compute, and norms but weaker model autonomy. The near-term challenge is integration via coupled Data x Compute investment, lifecycle governance (ModelOps), and safeguarded procurement. We then apply the model to the Middle East (Saudi Arabia and the UAE), where large public investment in Arabic-first models and sovereign cloud implies high sovereignty weights, lower effective fiscal constraints, and strong Data x Compute complementarities. An interior openness setting with guardrails emerges as optimal. Across contexts, the lesson is that sovereignty in AI needs managed interdependence, not isolation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c06AI\u4e3b\u6743\u89c6\u4e3a\u8fde\u7eed\u8c31\u800c\u975e\u4e8c\u5143\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u5728\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u4e0e\u76f8\u4e92\u4f9d\u5b58\u4e4b\u95f4\u5bfb\u6c42\u5e73\u8861\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u89c4\u5212\u8005\u6a21\u578b\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u653f\u7b56\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\uff1a\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u4e3b\u6743\u652f\u67f1\u95f4\u5747\u8861\u8fb9\u9645\u56de\u62a5\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u5168\u7403\u6536\u76ca\u7b49\u4e8e\u66b4\u9732\u98ce\u9669\u65f6\u8bbe\u5b9a\u5f00\u653e\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "AI\u4f5c\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u901a\u7528\u6280\u672f\u5f15\u53d1\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u4e3b\u6743\u56f0\u5883\uff0c\u5404\u56fd\u653f\u5e9c\u5e0c\u671b\u52a0\u5f3a\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u4f46AI\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u8981\u7d20\uff08\u5168\u7403\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u9053\u3001\u534a\u5bfc\u4f53\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u3001\u5f00\u6e90\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u3001\u56fd\u9645\u6807\u51c6\uff09\u5177\u6709\u6297\u5c01\u95ed\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u65b0\u601d\u8003\u4e3b\u6743\u6982\u5ff5\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u6982\u5ff5\u548c\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u501f\u9274\u7ecf\u5178\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u5386\u53f2\u7c7b\u6bd4\u548c\u5f53\u4ee3\u7f51\u7edc\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u8fa9\u8bba\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u89c4\u5212\u8005\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u5206\u6790\u4e3b\u6743AI\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u8c31\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5370\u5ea6\u548c\u4e2d\u4e1c\u6848\u4f8b\uff1a\u5370\u5ea6\u5728\u6570\u636e\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u89c4\u8303\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u4e3b\u6743\u7acb\u8db3\u70b9\u4f46\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u8f83\u5f31\uff1b\u4e2d\u4e1c\u56fd\u5bb6\u901a\u8fc7\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u4f18\u5148\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4e3b\u6743\u4e91\u6295\u8d44\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u4e3b\u6743\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u5f3a\u3002", "conclusion": "AI\u4e3b\u6743\u9700\u8981\u7ba1\u7406\u76f8\u4e92\u4f9d\u5b58\u800c\u975e\u9694\u79bb\uff0c\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u662f\u5728\u8bbe\u7f6e\u62a4\u680f\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u9002\u5ea6\u5f00\u653e\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u4e0e\u5168\u7403\u4e92\u8054\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002"}}

Ten Commandments for the Wise & Responsible Use of AI", "comment": null, "summary": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is no longer futuristic; it is a daily companion shaping our private and work lives. While AI simplifies our lives, its rise also invites us to rethink who we are - and who we wish to remain - as humans. Even if AI does not think, feel, or desire, it learns from our behavior, mirroring our collective values, biases, and aspirations. The question, then, is not what AI is, but what we are allowing it to become through data, computing power, and other parameters \"teaching\" it - and, even more importantly, who we are becoming through our relationship with AI.\n  As the EU AI Act and the Vienna Manifesto on Digital Humanism emphasize, technology must serve human dignity,social well-being, and democratic accountability. In our opinion, responsible use of AI is not only a matter of code nor law, but also of conscientious practice: how each of us engages and teaches others to use AI at home and at work.

To compensate for constant disturbances and guarantee offset-free tracking in the presence of model-plant mismatches, we propose a novel reformulation of the RNN model in velocity form. Conditions based on linear matrix inequalities are then derived for the design of a nonlinear state observer and a nonlinear state-feedback controller, ensuring global or regional closed-loop stability of the origin of the velocity form dynamics. Moreover, to handle input and output constraints, a theoretically sound offset-free nonlinear model predictive control algorithm is developed. The algorithm exploits the velocity form model as the prediction model and the static controller as an auxiliary law for the definition of the terminal ingredients.

By integrating multiple models, the ensemble large language model (eLLM) framework addresses common weaknesses of individual systems, including inconsistency, hallucination, category inflation, and misclassification. The eLLM approach yields a substantial performance improvement of up to 65\\% in F1-score over the strongest single model. We formalize the ensemble process through a mathematical model of collective decision-making and establish principled aggregation criteria. Using the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) hierarchical taxonomy, we evaluate ten state-of-the-art LLMs under identical zero-shot conditions on a human-annotated corpus of 8{,}660 samples. Results show that individual models plateau in performance due to the compression of semantically rich text into sparse categorical representations, while eLLM improves both robustness and accuracy.

JEL codes: J13, J22, I21", "summary": "This paper studies the impact of the 2022 Dobbs decision and subsequent state level abortion bans on the labor supply of young women (ages 18-24). Using monthly CPS micro data from January 2021 to December 2023, I exploit cross state variation in post Dobbs abortion policy and estimate Difference-in-Differences (DiD) and Triple-Difference (DDD) models. In a simple DiD comparing young women in ban versus protected states, labor force participation in ban states rises by 3.6 percentage points, while participation among young men in the same states falls by 2.9 percentage points, suggesting that the female response is unlikely to be driven by stronger local labor demand. The preferred DDD specification with state-by-month and gender interacted fixed effects implies a 6.6 percentage point increase in labor force participation for young women in ban states relative to young men. School enrollment does not change significantly, whereas employment increases by about 3 percentage points. These results suggest that abortion bans are associated with an immediate increase in young women's labor market attachment, potentially shifting their short run focus toward current earnings rather than human capital accumulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "2022\u5e74Dobbs\u88c1\u51b3\u540e\uff0c\u5dde\u7ea7\u5815\u80ce\u7981\u4ee4\u5bfc\u81f418-24\u5c81\u5e74\u8f7b\u5973\u6027\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u53c2\u4e0e\u7387\u663e\u8457\u4e0a\u53473.6-6.6\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff0c\u800c\u5e74\u8f7b\u7537\u6027\u53c2\u4e0e\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8fd9\u4e0d\u662f\u7531\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u9700\u6c42\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76Dobbs\u88c1\u51b3\u548c\u5dde\u7ea7\u5815\u80ce\u7981\u4ee4\u5bf9\u5e74\u8f7b\u5973\u6027\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u4f9b\u7ed9\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u751f\u6b96\u6743\u5229\u9650\u5236\u5982\u4f55\u6539\u53d8\u5973\u6027\u7684\u52b3\u52a8\u5e02\u573a\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u75282021\u5e741\u6708\u81f32023\u5e7412\u6708\u7684\u6708\u5ea6CPS\u5fae\u89c2\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u91cd\u5dee\u5206(DiD)\u548c\u4e09\u91cd\u5dee\u5206(DDD)\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5404\u5dde\u5815\u80ce\u653f\u7b56\u7684\u8de8\u5dde\u5dee\u5f02\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u5815\u80ce\u7981\u4ee4\u5dde\u7684\u5e74\u8f7b\u5973\u6027\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u53c2\u4e0e\u7387\u4e0a\u53473.6-6.6\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff0c\u5c31\u4e1a\u7387\u4e0a\u5347\u7ea63\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff0c\u5b66\u6821\u6ce8\u518c\u7387\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5e74\u8f7b\u7537\u6027\u53c2\u4e0e\u7387\u4e0b\u964d2.9\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5815\u80ce\u7981\u4ee4\u4e0e\u5e74\u8f7b\u5973\u6027\u52b3\u52a8\u5e02\u573a\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u7684\u7acb\u5373\u589e\u52a0\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u4f7f\u5979\u4eec\u77ed\u671f\u5185\u66f4\u5173\u6ce8\u5f53\u524d\u6536\u5165\u800c\u975e\u4eba\u529b\u8d44\u672c\u79ef\u7d2f\u3002"}}

The temporal dynamics is engineered by controlling the thickness of the Chemical Vapor Deposited (CVD) MoS$_2$ films. Devices with a monolayer (1L)-MoS$_2$ film exhibit volatile (short-term memory) switching dynamics. We also report non-volatile resistance switching with excellent uniformity and analog behavior in conductance tuning for the multilayer (ML) MoS$_2$ memristive devices. We correlate this performance with trap-assisted space-charge limited conduction (SCLC) mechanism, leading to a bulk-limited resistance switching behavior. Four-bit reservoir states are generated using volatile memristors. The readout layer is implemented with an array of nonvolatile synapses.

However, NSFW is becoming more common on mainstream platforms, with X now allowing such material. We examine the top 15 NSFW-restricted subreddits by size to explore the complexities of responsibly sharing adult content, aiming to balance ethical and legal considerations with monetization opportunities. We find that users often use NSFW subreddits as a social springboard, redirecting readers to private or specialized adult social platforms such as Telegram, Kik or OnlyFans for further interactions. They also directly negotiate image \"trades\" through credit cards or payment platforms such as PayPal, Bitcoin or Venmo. Disturbingly, we also find linguistic cues linked to non-consensual content sharing. To help platforms moderate such behavior, we trained a RoBERTa-based classification model, which outperforms GPT-4 and traditional classifiers such as logistic regression and random forest in identifying non-consensual content sharing, demonstrating superior performance in this specific task.

As AI tools become more integrated into classrooms, there is an urgent need for pedagogical approaches that help students use them critically and reflectively. This study proposes a pedagogical design that integrates AI and peer feedback in a graduate-level academic writing activity. Over eight weeks, students developed literature review projects through multiple writing and revision stages, receiving feedback from both a custom-built AI reviewer and human peers. We examine two questions: (1) How did students interact with and incorporate AI and peer feedback during the writing process? and (2) How did they reflect on and build relationships with both human and AI reviewers? Data sources include student writing artifacts, AI and peer feedback, AI chat logs, and student reflections. Findings show that students engaged differently with each feedback source-relying on AI for rubric alignment and surface-level edits, and on peer feedback for conceptual development and disciplinary relevance. Reflections revealed evolving relationships with AI, characterized by increasing confidence, strategic use, and critical awareness of its limitations. The pedagogical design supported writing development, AI literacy, and disciplinary understanding.

The framework integrates data-driven modeling, event-triggered communication, and fractional-order sliding mode control (FSMC) to enhance the resilience against adversarial interventions. A dynamic model decomposition (DMD)-based methodology is employed to extract the lateral dynamics from real-world data, eliminating the reliance on conventional mechanistic modeling. To optimize communication efficiency, an event-triggered transmission scheme is designed to reduce the redundant transmissions while ensuring system stability. Furthermore, an extended state observer (ESO) is developed for real-time estimation and mitigation of actuator attack effects. Theoretical stability analysis, conducted using Lyapunov methods and linear matrix inequality (LMI) formulations, guarantees exponential error convergence. Extensive simulations validate the proposed event-triggered secure control framework, demonstrating substantial improvements in attack mitigation, communication efficiency, and lateral tracking performance. The results show that the framework effectively counteracts actuator attacks while optimizing communication-resource utilization, making it highly suitable for safety-critical AV applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u6267\u884c\u5668\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u4e8b\u4ef6\u89e6\u53d1\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u5206\u6570\u9636\u6ed1\u6a21\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u89e3\u63d0\u53d6\u6a2a\u5411\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e8b\u4ef6\u89e6\u53d1\u4f20\u8f93\u65b9\u6848\u4f18\u5316\u901a\u4fe1\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u6269\u5c55\u72b6\u6001\u89c2\u6d4b\u5668\u5b9e\u65f6\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\u653b\u51fb\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u9762\u4e34\u6267\u884c\u5668\u653b\u51fb\u7b49\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u673a\u7406\u5efa\u6a21\u4e14\u901a\u4fe1\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u65f6\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\u653b\u51fb\u3001\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u901a\u4fe1\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u89e3\u4ece\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u6a2a\u5411\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e8b\u4ef6\u89e6\u53d1\u4f20\u8f93\u65b9\u6848\u51cf\u5c11\u5197\u4f59\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u6269\u5c55\u72b6\u6001\u89c2\u6d4b\u5668\u5b9e\u65f6\u4f30\u8ba1\u653b\u51fb\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5206\u6570\u9636\u6ed1\u6a21\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Lyapunov\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u7ebf\u6027\u77e9\u9635\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u8fdb\u884c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u653b\u51fb\u7f13\u89e3\u3001\u901a\u4fe1\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6a2a\u5411\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6027\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u62b5\u6d88\u6267\u884c\u5668\u653b\u51fb\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u901a\u4fe1\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u4e8b\u4ef6\u89e6\u53d1\u5b89\u5168\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u6267\u884c\u5668\u653b\u51fb\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7cfb\u7edf\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Prior approaches often assume fixed goals, reducing goal prediction to a one-time inference. However, in real-world scenarios, humans frequently shift goals, making it challenging for robots to adapt without explicit communication. We propose a method for detecting goal changes by tracking multiple candidate action sequences and verifying their plausibility against a policy bank. Upon detecting a change, the robot refines its belief in relevant past actions and constructs Receding Horizon Planning (RHP) trees to actively select actions that assist the human while encouraging Differentiating Actions to reveal their updated goal. We evaluate our approach in a collaborative cooking environment with up to 30 unique recipes and compare it to three comparable human goal prediction algorithms.

We develop a framework where bounded rationality and heterogeneous cognitive biases shape the evolutionary dynamics of norm coordination. Extending evolutionary game theory with quantal response equilibria and prospect-theoretic utility, we show that subjective evaluation of payoffs systematically alters population-level equilibrium selection, generating stable but inefficient attractors. Counterintuitively, our analysis demonstrates that the benefit of rationality and the cost of risk aversion on welfare behave in nonmonotone ways: intermediate precision enhances coordination, while excessive precision or strong loss aversion leads to persistent lock-in at low-payoff and zero-sum equilibria. These dynamics produce an endogenous equity-efficiency trade-off: parameter configurations that raise aggregate welfare also increase inequality, while more equal distributions are associated with lower efficiency. The results highlight how distorted payoff perceptions can anchor societies in divergent institutional trajectories, offering a behavioral-evolutionary explanation for persistent zero-sum norms and inequality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408\u6709\u9650\u7406\u6027\u548c\u8ba4\u77e5\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u535a\u5f08\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u4f55\u96f6\u548c\u601d\u7ef4\u7b49\u4f4e\u6548\u89c4\u8303\u4f1a\u6301\u7eed\u5b58\u5728\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u7406\u6027\u7a0b\u5ea6\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u89c4\u907f\u5bf9\u798f\u5229\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u662f\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u7684\uff0c\u4e2d\u7b49\u7406\u6027\u7a0b\u5ea6\u6709\u5229\u4e8e\u534f\u8c03\uff0c\u800c\u8fc7\u5ea6\u7406\u6027\u6216\u5f3a\u635f\u5931\u538c\u6076\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f4e\u6536\u76ca\u5747\u8861\u9501\u5b9a\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u5373\u4f7f\u4f1a\u7834\u574f\u5408\u4f5c\u548c\u6295\u8d44\uff0c\u96f6\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u7b49\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u826f\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u548c\u89c4\u8303\u4ecd\u7136\u6301\u7eed\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u63a2\u7a76\u6709\u9650\u7406\u6027\u548c\u8ba4\u77e5\u504f\u5dee\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u89c4\u8303\u534f\u8c03\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "method": "\u6269\u5c55\u6f14\u5316\u535a\u5f08\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u91cf\u5316\u53cd\u5e94\u5747\u8861\u548c\u524d\u666f\u7406\u8bba\u6548\u7528\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e3b\u89c2\u6536\u76ca\u8bc4\u4f30\u5982\u4f55\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u6539\u53d8\u7fa4\u4f53\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u5747\u8861\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u7406\u6027\u7a0b\u5ea6\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u89c4\u907f\u5bf9\u798f\u5229\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u662f\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u7684\uff1a\u4e2d\u7b49\u7cbe\u5ea6\u589e\u5f3a\u534f\u8c03\uff0c\u800c\u8fc7\u5ea6\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6216\u5f3a\u635f\u5931\u538c\u6076\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f4e\u6536\u76ca\u548c\u96f6\u548c\u5747\u8861\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u9501\u5b9a\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u52a8\u6001\u4ea7\u751f\u5185\u751f\u7684\u516c\u5e73-\u6548\u7387\u6743\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "\u626d\u66f2\u7684\u6536\u76ca\u611f\u77e5\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c06\u793e\u4f1a\u951a\u5b9a\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5236\u5ea6\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e3a\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u96f6\u548c\u89c4\u8303\u548c\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u884c\u4e3a\u6f14\u5316\u89e3\u91ca\u3002"}}

In an era of intense political polarization, a critical question is whether these widely-watched \"debate\" shows foster genuine discussion or have devolved into partisan echo chambers that deepen societal divides. While these programs claim to air competing viewpoints, no large-scale evidence exists to quantify how often hosts and guests actually disagree. Measuring these exchanges is a significant challenge, as live broadcasts contain overlapping speakers, sarcasm, and billions of words of text. To address this gap, we construct the first speaker-resolved map of agreement and disagreement across U.S. cable opinion programming. Our study assembles over 21,000 episodes from 24 flagship shows on Fox News, MSNBC, and CNN from 2010-2024, segmenting them into host-guest turns and labeling 2.13 million turn-pairs using a high-fidelity large-language-model classifier. We present three findings: (1) the proportion of disagreement/debate on prime time shows a consistent downward trend, dropping by roughly one-third between 2017 and 2024; (2) on-air challenge is partisan and asymmetric--conservatives seldom face push-back on Fox, liberals seldom on MSNBC, with CNN declining toward the midpoint; and (3) polarizing issues such as abortion, gun rights, and immigration attract the least disagreement. The work contributes a public corpus, an open-source stance pipeline, and the first longitudinal evidence that televised \"debate\" is retreating from genuine discussion. By transforming into platforms for partisan affirmation, these shows erode the cross-cutting cleavages essential for a pluralistic society, thereby intensifying affective polarization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u7f8e\u56fd\u9ec4\u91d1\u65f6\u6bb5\u6709\u7ebf\u65b0\u95fb\u8fa9\u8bba\u8282\u76ee\u4e2d\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u8fa9\u8bba\u6bd4\u4f8b\u6301\u7eed\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5206\u6b67\u5bf9\u8bdd\u57282017-2024\u5e74\u95f4\u51cf\u5c11\u7ea6\u4e09\u5206\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u5448\u73b0\u51fa\u515a\u6d3e\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u6781\u5316\u8bae\u9898\u5438\u5f15\u6700\u5c11\u5206\u6b67\u8ba8\u8bba\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u653f\u6cbb\u6781\u5316\u52a0\u5267\u7684\u65f6\u4ee3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u91cf\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fd9\u4e9b\u58f0\u79f0\u5c55\u793a\u7ade\u4e89\u89c2\u70b9\u7684\u8282\u76ee\u662f\u5426\u771f\u6b63\u4fc3\u8fdb\u8ba8\u8bba\uff0c\u8fd8\u662f\u5df2\u6ca6\u4e3a\u52a0\u6df1\u793e\u4f1a\u5206\u88c2\u7684\u515a\u6d3e\u56de\u97f3\u5ba4\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e862010-2024\u5e74\u798f\u514b\u65af\u65b0\u95fb\u3001MSNBC\u548cCNN\u768424\u4e2a\u65d7\u8230\u8282\u76ee\u517121,000\u591a\u96c6\u7684\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5bf9213\u4e07\u5bf9\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8f6e\u6b21\u8fdb\u884c\u6807\u6ce8\u3002", "result": "1) \u8fa9\u8bba\u6bd4\u4f8b\u5448\u4e0b\u964d\u8d8b\u52bf\uff1b2) \u73b0\u573a\u6311\u6218\u5448\u73b0\u515a\u6d3e\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff1b3) \u6781\u5316\u8bae\u9898\u5438\u5f15\u6700\u5c11\u5206\u6b67\u8ba8\u8bba\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7535\u89c6'\u8fa9\u8bba'\u6b63\u5728\u8fdc\u79bb\u771f\u6b63\u8ba8\u8bba\uff0c\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u515a\u6d3e\u80af\u5b9a\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u4fb5\u8680\u591a\u5143\u793e\u4f1a\u6240\u9700\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u5206\u6b67\uff0c\u52a0\u5267\u60c5\u611f\u6781\u5316\u3002"}}

Focusing on analogizing as a fundamental driver of knowledge, we examine how LLMs generate connections through large-scale statistical inference. Analyzing their operation across the dimensions of surface/deep analogies and near/far domains, we highlight both their capacity to expand organizational knowing and the epistemic risks they introduce.

These findings highlight the potential of functional and transformative auditory design to enhance human-robot collaboration and inform future sound-based interaction strategies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u58f0\u97f3\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u64cd\u4f5c\u58f0\u97f3\u4e0d\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4fa7\u5411\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u51c6\u786e\u4f46\u6b63\u5411\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u7a7a\u95f4\u58f0\u97f3\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u4f20\u9012\u4efb\u52a1\u4fe1\u606f\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u6e29\u6696\u611f\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u65e5\u76ca\u878d\u5165\u65e5\u5e38\u751f\u6d3b\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u5b83\u4eec\u5982\u4f55\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u6c9f\u901a\u53d8\u5f97\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u58f0\u97f3\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u6e20\u9053\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u64cd\u4f5c\u566a\u97f3\u548c\u6709\u610f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u542c\u89c9\u63d0\u793a\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u4ea4\u63a5\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u7ed3\u679c\u6027\u548c\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u58f0\u97f3\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u7a7a\u95f4\u58f0\u97f3\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "result": "Kinova Gen3\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u6027\u58f0\u97f3\u672a\u5bf9\u611f\u77e5\u4ea7\u751f\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u4fa7\u5411\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u9ad8\u5ea6\u51c6\u786e\uff0c\u4f46\u6b63\u5411\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u7a7a\u95f4\u58f0\u97f3\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u4f20\u8fbe\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\u5e76\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6e29\u6696\u611f\u3001\u51cf\u5c11\u4e0d\u9002\u3002", "conclusion": "\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u548c\u53d8\u9769\u6027\u542c\u89c9\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u589e\u5f3a\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u57fa\u4e8e\u58f0\u97f3\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u4f9b\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

We present MACIE Multi Agent Causal Intelligence Explainer, a framework combining structural causal models, interventional counterfactuals, and Shapley values to provide comprehensive explanations. MACIE addresses three questions. First, each agent's causal contribution using interventional attribution scores. Second, system level emergent intelligence through synergy metrics separating collective effects from individual contributions. Third, actionable explanations using natural language narratives synthesizing causal insights. We evaluate MACIE across four MARL scenarios: cooperative, competitive, and mixed motive. Results show accurate outcome attribution, mean phi_i equals 5.07, standard deviation less than 0.05, detection of positive emergence in cooperative tasks, synergy index up to 0.461, and efficient computation, 0.79 seconds per dataset on CPU.

Currently, most AIBM studies are based on the classical Independent Cascade (IC) model, which omits the time factor and thus hinders their applications to time-critical scenarios like political campaigns or public emergencies. More importantly, existing AIBM studies have not investigated in-depth the submodularity of the objective function, resulting in their failure to provide a theoretical lower bound for the problem. To address these challenges, firstly, this paper proposes the Time-Critical Independent Cascade (TC-IC) model, which incorporates time constraints into the classical IC model. Secondly, the Time-Critical Adversarial Influence Blocking Maximization (TC-AIBM) is established to better handle time-critical scenarios. A detailed formulation of the problem is then presented, along with a theoretical proof of its submodularity under three different tie-breaking rules. Finally, a Bidirectional Influence Sampling (BIS) algorithm is proposed to solve the TC-AIBM problem.

Recent literature suggests that such technologies represent more than just an efficiency tool; they mark a paradigm shift in regulation and the evolution of financial oversight (Kurum, 2023). This paper aims to provide a narrative review of recent RegTech applications in financial crime prevention, with a focus on key compliance domains. A structured literature review was conducted to examine publications between 2020 and 2024 with a thematic synthesis of findings related to customer due diligence (CDD) and know your customer (KYC), transaction monitoring, regulatory reporting and compliance automation, information sharing and cross border cooperation, as well as cost efficiency. Findings reveal that RegTech solutions give financial institutions more responsibility for detecting and managing financial crime risks, making them more active players in compliance processes traditionally overseen by regulators. The combined use of technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, and big data also generates synergistic effects that improve compliance outcomes beyond what these technologies achieve individually. This demonstrates the strategic relevance of integrated RegTech approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf92020-2024\u5e74\u95f4RegTech\u5728\u91d1\u878d\u72af\u7f6a\u9884\u9632\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u53d9\u8ff0\u6027\u7efc\u8ff0\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5ba2\u6237\u5c3d\u804c\u8c03\u67e5\u3001\u4ea4\u6613\u76d1\u63a7\u3001\u76d1\u7ba1\u62a5\u544a\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u5408\u89c4\u9886\u57df\u3002", "motivation": "RegTech\u6b63\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u5148\u8fdb\u4fe1\u606f\u6280\u672f\u6765\u6539\u53d8\u91d1\u878d\u5408\u89c4\uff0c\u52a0\u5f3a\u53cd\u6d17\u94b1\u548c\u53cd\u6050\u6016\u878d\u8d44\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8fd9\u4ee3\u8868\u4e86\u76d1\u7ba1\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u8f6c\u53d8\u548c\u91d1\u878d\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u6f14\u53d8\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5bf92020-2024\u5e74\u95f4\u7684\u51fa\u7248\u7269\u8fdb\u884c\u5ba1\u67e5\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u5ba2\u6237\u5c3d\u804c\u8c03\u67e5\u3001\u4ea4\u6613\u76d1\u63a7\u3001\u76d1\u7ba1\u62a5\u544a\u3001\u5408\u89c4\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u5171\u4eab\u548c\u8de8\u5883\u5408\u4f5c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u7b49\u4e3b\u9898\u8fdb\u884c\u7efc\u5408\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0RegTech\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u4f7f\u91d1\u878d\u673a\u6784\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u7ba1\u7406\u91d1\u878d\u72af\u7f6a\u98ce\u9669\u65b9\u9762\u627f\u62c5\u66f4\u591a\u8d23\u4efb\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u5728\u4f20\u7edf\u4e0a\u7531\u76d1\u7ba1\u673a\u6784\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u5408\u89c4\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u6210\u4e3a\u66f4\u79ef\u6781\u7684\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u3002\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u3001\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u548c\u5927\u6570\u636e\u7b49\u6280\u672f\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u4f7f\u7528\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\u534f\u540c\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u5408\u89c4\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7efc\u5408RegTech\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u6218\u7565\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u6280\u672f\u7ec4\u5408\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u534f\u540c\u6548\u5e94\u8d85\u51fa\u4e86\u5355\u4e2a\u6280\u672f\u6240\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

Submitted to Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies. Preprint version", "summary": "Reconstructing complete traffic flow time-space diagrams from vehicle trajectories offer a comprehensive view on traffic dynamics at arterial intersections. However, obtaining full trajectories across networks is costly, and accurately inferring lane-changing (LC) and car-following behaviors in multi-lane environments remains challenging. This study proposes a generative framework for arterial vehicle trajectory reconstruction that jointly models lane-changing and car-following behaviors through physics-informed multi-task joint learning. The framework consists of a Lane-Change Generative Adversarial Network (LC-GAN) and a Trajectory-GAN. The LC-GAN models stochastic LC behavior from historical trajectories while considering physical conditions of arterial intersections, such as signal control, geometric configuration, and interactions with surrounding vehicles. The Trajectory-GAN then incorporates LC information from the LC-GAN with initial trajectories generated from physics-based car-following models, refining them in a data-driven manner to adapt to dynamic traffic conditions. The proposed framework is designed to reconstruct complete trajectories from only a small subset of connected vehicle (CV) trajectories; for example, even a single observed trajectory per lane, by incorporating partial trajectory information into the generative process. A multi-task joint learning facilitates synergistic interaction between the LC-GAN and Trajectory-GAN, allowing each component to serves as both auxiliary supervision and a physical condition for the other. Validation using two real-world trajectory datasets demonstrates that the framework outperforms conventional benchmark models in reconstructing complete time-space diagrams for multi-lane arterial intersections.

Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Robotics (T-RO), 2025", "summary": "Many robots are not equipped with a manipulator and many objects are not suitable for prehensile manipulation (such as large boxes and cylinders). In these cases, pushing is a simple yet effective non-prehensile skill for robots to interact with and further change the environment. Existing work often assumes a set of predefined pushing modes and fixed-shape objects. This work tackles the general problem of controlling a robotic fleet to push collaboratively numerous arbitrary objects to respective destinations, within complex environments of cluttered and movable obstacles. It incorporates several characteristic challenges for multi-robot systems such as online task coordination under large uncertainties of cost and duration, and for contact-rich tasks such as hybrid switching among different contact modes, and under-actuation due to constrained contact forces. The proposed method is based on combinatorial hybrid optimization over dynamic task assignments and hybrid execution via sequences of pushing modes and associated forces. It consists of three main components: (I) the decomposition, ordering and rolling assignment of pushing subtasks to robot subgroups; (II) the keyframe guided hybrid search to optimize the sequence of parameterized pushing modes for each subtask; (III) the hybrid control to execute these modes and transit among them.

Recent instruction-first systems translate grids into concise natural-language or DSL rules executed in generate-execute-select loops, yet we lack a principled account of how encodings shape model perception and how to separate instruction errors from execution errors. We hypothesize that modality imposes perceptual bottlenecks -- text flattens 2D structure into 1D tokens while images preserve layout but can introduce patch-size aliasing -- thereby shaping which grid features are reliably perceived. To test this, we isolate perception from reasoning across nine text and image modalities using a weighted set-disagreement metric and a two-stage reasoning pipeline, finding that structured text yields precise coordinates on sparse features, images capture 2D shapes yet are resolution-sensitive, and combining them improves execution (about 8 perception points; about 0.20 median similarity).

This paper introduces a synaptic Q-learning algorithm for the control of the classical Cartpole, where the Bellman equations are incorporated at the synaptic level. This formulation enables the iterative evolution of the network topology, represented as a directed graph, throughout the training process. This is followed by a similar approach called neuromorphic Bellman Memory Units (BMU(s)), which are implemented with the Neural Engineering Framework on Intel's Loihi neuromorphic chip.

We present the \"Semantic Glitch,\" a soft flying robotic art installation whose physical form, a 3D pixel style cloud, is a \"physical glitch\" derived from digital archaeology. We detail a novel autonomous pipeline that rejects conventional sensors like LiDAR and SLAM, relying solely on the qualitative, semantic understanding of a Multimodal Large Language Model to navigate. By authoring a bio-inspired personality for the robot through a natural language prompt, we create a \"narrative mind\" that complements the \"weak,\" historically, loaded body. Our analysis begins with a 13-minute autonomous flight log, and a follow-up study statistically validates the framework's robustness for authoring quantifiably distinct personas. The combined analysis reveals emergent behaviors, from landmark-based navigation to a compelling \"plan to execution\" gap, and a character whose unpredictable, plausible behavior stems from a lack of precise proprioception.

However, the scarcity of high-quality trajectories still hinders the development of stronger LLM agents. Most existing works on multi-turn dialogue synthesis validate correctness only at the trajectory level, which may overlook turn-level errors that can propagate during training and degrade model performance. To address these limitations, we introduce ToolMind, a large-scale, high-quality tool-agentic dataset with 160k synthetic data instances generated using over 20k tools and 200k augmented open-source data instances. Our data synthesis pipeline first constructs a function graph based on parameter correlations and then uses a multi-agent framework to simulate realistic user-assistant-tool interactions. Beyond trajectory-level validation, we employ fine-grained turn-level filtering to remove erroneous or suboptimal steps, ensuring that only high-quality reasoning traces are retained. This approach mitigates error amplification during training while preserving self-corrective reasoning signals essential for robust tool-use learning.

We further examine how GenAI and LLMs transform the research process itself, comparing the capabilities of human researchers and AI agents across the entire research workflow.

Artificial Intelligence and modern computing are unlocking opportunities, yet their value lies in the data that fuels them. The value of healthcare data is no longer limited to individual patients. However, data stewardship and governance has not kept pace, and privacy-centric policies are hindering both innovation and patient protections. As healthcare moves toward a data-driven future, we must define reformed data stewardship that prioritizes patients' interests by proactively managing modern risks and opportunities while addressing key challenges in cost, efficacy, and accessibility.\n  Current healthcare data policies are rooted in 20th-century legislation shaped by outdated understandings of data-prioritizing perceived privacy over innovation and inclusion. While other industries thrive in a data-driven era, the evolution of medicine remains constrained by regulations that impose social rather than scientific boundaries. Large-scale aggregation is happening, but within opaque, closed systems. As we continue to uphold foundational ethical principles - autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, and justice - there is a growing imperative to acknowledge they exist in evolving technological, social, and cultural realities.\n  Ethical principles should facilitate, rather than obstruct, dialogue on adapting to meet opportunities and address constraints in medical practice and healthcare delivery. The new ethics of data stewardship places patients first by defining governance that adapts to changing landscapes. It also rejects the legacy of treating perceived privacy as an unquestionable, guiding principle.

This paper presents a hardware-efficient complex neural dynamics model achieved through the linear decoupling, diagonalization, and reparameterization of the state-space model, introducing a novel paradigm for the physics-informed method that offers high explainability and accuracy in electric motor temperature estimation tasks.

We introduce Bi-AQUA, the first underwater bilateral control-based imitation learning framework that integrates lighting-aware visual processing for underwater robot arms. Bi-AQUA employs a hierarchical three-level lighting adaptation mechanism: a Lighting Encoder that extracts lighting representations from RGB images without manual annotation and is implicitly supervised by the imitation objective, FiLM modulation of visual backbone features for adaptive, lighting-aware feature extraction, and an explicit lighting token added to the transformer encoder input for task-aware conditioning. Experiments on a real-world underwater pick-and-place task under diverse static and dynamic lighting conditions show that Bi-AQUA achieves robust performance and substantially outperforms a bilateral baseline without lighting modeling. Ablation studies further confirm that all three lighting-aware components are critical. This work bridges terrestrial bilateral control-based imitation learning and underwater manipulation, enabling force-sensitive autonomous operation in challenging marine environments.

However, much of this content is not easily digestible by LLMs due to LLM-unfriendly formats and limitations of context length. To address this issue, we propose a method for generating general-purpose, information-dense summaries that act as plain-text repositories of web content. Inspired by Hegel's dialectical method, our approach, denoted as Chain of Summaries (CoS), iteratively refines an initial summary (thesis) by identifying its limitations through questioning (antithesis), leading to a general-purpose summary (synthesis) that can satisfy current and anticipate future information needs. Experiments on the TriviaQA, TruthfulQA, and SQUAD datasets demonstrate that CoS outperforms zero-shot LLM baselines by up to 66% and specialized summarization methods such as BRIO and PEGASUS by up to 27%. CoS-generated summaries yield higher Q&A performance compared to the source content, while requiring substantially fewer tokens and being agnostic to the specific downstream LLM. CoS thus resembles an appealing option for website maintainers to make their content more accessible for LLMs, while retaining possibilities for human oversight.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faChain of Summaries (CoS)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7c7b\u4f3c\u9ed1\u683c\u5c14\u8fa9\u8bc1\u6cd5\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u6458\u8981\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u4fe1\u606f\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6458\u8981\uff0c\u4f7f\u7f51\u9875\u5185\u5bb9\u66f4\u6613\u4e8eLLM\u6d88\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3LLM\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5916\u90e8\u7f51\u9875\u5185\u5bb9\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u683c\u5f0f\u4e0d\u53cb\u597d\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u9650\u5236\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f7f\u7f51\u9875\u5185\u5bb9\u66f4\u6613\u4e8eLLM\u8bbf\u95ee\u548c\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u9ed1\u683c\u5c14\u8fa9\u8bc1\u6cd5\u601d\u60f3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u521d\u59cb\u6458\u8981\uff08\u6b63\u9898\uff09\u3001\u8d28\u7591\u8bc6\u522b\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff08\u53cd\u9898\uff09\u3001\u751f\u6210\u901a\u7528\u6458\u8981\uff08\u5408\u9898\uff09\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u4fe1\u606f\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6458\u8981\u3002", "result": "\u5728TriviaQA\u3001TruthfulQA\u548cSQUAD\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cCoS\u6bd4\u96f6\u6837\u672cLLM\u57fa\u7ebf\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe66%\uff0c\u6bd4\u4e13\u95e8\u6458\u8981\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982BRIO\u548cPEGASUS\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe27%\u3002\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6458\u8981\u7528\u66f4\u5c11token\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u9ad8Q&A\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "CoS\u4e3a\u7f51\u7ad9\u7ef4\u62a4\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f7f\u5185\u5bb9\u66f4\u6613\u4e8eLLM\u8bbf\u95ee\u7684\u5438\u5f15\u4eba\u9009\u9879\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u4eba\u5de5\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002"}}

In safety-critical environments such as construction sites, accident data often exists in multiple formats, such as written reports, inspection records, and site imagery, making it challenging to synthesize hazards using traditional approaches. To address this, this thesis proposed a multimodal AI framework that combines text and image analysis to assist in identifying safety hazards on construction sites. Two case studies were consucted to evaluate the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) for automated hazard identification.The first case study introduces a hybrid pipeline that utilizes GPT 4o and GPT 4o mini to extract structured insights from a dataset of 28,000 OSHA accident reports (2000-2025). The second case study extends this investigation using Molmo 7B and Qwen2 VL 2B, lightweight, open-source VLMs. Using the public ConstructionSite10k dataset, the performance of the two models was evaluated on rule-level safety violation detection using natural language prompts. This experiment served as a cost-aware benchmark against proprietary models and allowed testing at scale with ground-truth labels. Despite their smaller size, Molmo 7B and Quen2 VL 2B showed competitive performance in certain prompt configurations, reinforcing the feasibility of low-resource multimodal systems for rule-aware safety monitoring.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u6a21\u6001AI\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6587\u672c\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u5efa\u7b51\u5de5\u5730\u5b89\u5168\u9690\u60a3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86LLM\u548cVLM\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u5371\u9669\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5efa\u7b51\u5de5\u5730\u7b49\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e8b\u6545\u6570\u636e\u901a\u5e38\u4ee5\u591a\u79cd\u683c\u5f0f\u5b58\u5728\uff08\u5982\u4e66\u9762\u62a5\u544a\u3001\u68c0\u67e5\u8bb0\u5f55\u548c\u73b0\u573a\u56fe\u50cf\uff09\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u7efc\u5408\u8bc6\u522b\u5371\u9669\u6e90\u3002", "method": "\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528GPT 4o\u548cGPT 4o mini\u4ece28,000\u4efdOSHA\u4e8b\u6545\u62a5\u544a\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u89c1\u89e3\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u4e2a\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528Molmo 7B\u548cQwen2 VL 2B\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5f00\u6e90VLM\uff0c\u5728ConstructionSite10k\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u89c4\u5219\u7ea7\u5b89\u5168\u8fdd\u89c4\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u8f83\u5c0f\uff0c\u4f46Molmo 7B\u548cQwen2 VL 2B\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u63d0\u793a\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff0c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7528\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u611f\u77e5\u5b89\u5168\u76d1\u63a7\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001AI\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u7ed3\u5408\u6587\u672c\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u6570\u636e\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u5efa\u7b51\u5b89\u5168\uff0c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u76d1\u63a7\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Despite increasing policy and research attention, existing LoC definitions vary significantly in scope and timeline, hindering effective LoC assessment and mitigation. To address this issue, we draw from an extensive literature review and propose a graded LoC taxonomy, based on the metrics of severity and persistence, that distinguishes between Deviation, Bounded LoC, and Strict LoC. We model pathways toward a societal state of vulnerability in which sufficiently advanced AI systems have acquired or could acquire the means to cause Bounded or Strict LoC once a catalyst, either misalignment or pure malfunction, materializes. We argue that this state becomes increasingly likely over time, absent strategic intervention, and propose a strategy to avoid reaching a state of vulnerability. Rather than focusing solely on intervening on AI capabilities and propensities potentially relevant for LoC or on preventing potential catalysts, we introduce a complementary framework that emphasizes three extrinsic factors: Deployment context, Affordances, and Permissions (the DAP framework). Compared to work on intrinsic factors and catalysts, this framework has the unfair advantage of being actionable today. Finally, we put forward a plan to maintain preparedness and prevent the occurrence of LoC outcomes should a state of societal vulnerability be reached, focusing on governance measures (threat modeling, deployment policies, emergency response) and technical controls (pre-deployment testing, control measures, monitoring) that could maintain a condition of perennial suspension.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5931\u63a7(LoC)\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e25\u91cd\u6027\u548c\u6301\u4e45\u6027\u6307\u6807\u7684\u5206\u7ea7LoC\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5(\u504f\u5dee\u3001\u6709\u754c\u5931\u63a7\u3001\u4e25\u683c\u5931\u63a7)\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u90e8\u7f72\u73af\u5883\u3001\u53ef\u7528\u8d44\u6e90\u548c\u6743\u9650(DAP)\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u9884\u9632\u5931\u63a7\u72b6\u6001\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709AI\u5931\u63a7\u5b9a\u4e49\u5728\u8303\u56f4\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u7ebf\u4e0a\u5dee\u5f02\u5f88\u5927\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684LoC\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684LoC\u5b9a\u4e49\u548c\u51c6\u5907\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u6587\u732e\u56de\u987e\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e25\u91cd\u6027\u548c\u6301\u4e45\u6027\u6307\u6807\u7684\u5206\u7ea7LoC\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86DAP\u6846\u67b6(\u90e8\u7f72\u73af\u5883\u3001\u53ef\u7528\u8d44\u6e90\u3001\u6743\u9650)\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u884c\u52a8\u7684\u5916\u90e8\u56e0\u7d20\u5e72\u9884\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b\u6cbb\u7406\u63aa\u65bd(\u5a01\u80c1\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u90e8\u7f72\u653f\u7b56\u3001\u5e94\u6025\u54cd\u5e94)\u548c\u6280\u672f\u63a7\u5236(\u90e8\u7f72\u524d\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3001\u63a7\u5236\u63aa\u65bd\u3001\u76d1\u63a7)\u7684\u51c6\u5907\u8ba1\u5212\uff0c\u4ee5\u7ef4\u6301\u6c38\u4e45\u6682\u505c\u72b6\u6001\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4eca\u5929\u5c31\u53ef\u5b9e\u65bd\u7684\u884c\u52a8\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5173\u6ce8\u5916\u90e8\u56e0\u7d20\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u5185\u5728\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u50ac\u5316\u5242\uff0c\u4e3a\u9884\u9632AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5931\u63a7\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

Its core idea is to replace \"raw data communication\" with \"semantic communication\" by performing \"semantic distillation\" at the robot edge, reconstructing high-dimensional perceptual data into compact, structured physical representations. This idea is primarily realized through two key components: (1) a novel Physical Interaction Prediction Network (PIPN), derived from large model knowledge distillation, to generate this representation; and (2) a Hamiltonian Energy Network (HEN) controller, based on energy conservation, to precisely translate this representation into coordinated actions. Experiments show that, compared to baseline methods, PIPHEN can compress the information representation to less than 5% of the original data volume and reduce collaborative decision-making latency from 315ms to 76ms, while significantly improving task success rates.

While existing surveys often categorize recent progress based on input modality (e.g., text, image, video, or 3D), we argue that spatial ability is not solely determined by the input format. Instead, our survey introduces a taxonomy that organizes spatial intelligence from cognitive aspect and divides tasks in terms of reasoning complexity, linking them to several cognitive functions. We map existing benchmarks across text only, vision language, and embodied settings onto this taxonomy, and review evaluation metrics and methodologies for assessing spatial reasoning ability. This cognitive perspective enables more principled cross-task comparisons and reveals critical gaps between current model capabilities and human-like reasoning.

However, existing approaches to measuring AI exposure in the workforce predominantly rely on concurrent market conditions, offering limited predictive capacity for anticipating future disruptions. This paper presents a predictive study examining whether online discussions about LLMs can function as early indicators of labor market shifts. We employ four distinct analytical approaches to identify the domains and timeframes in which public discourse serves as a leading signal for employment changes, thereby demonstrating its predictive validity for labor market dynamics. Drawing on a comprehensive dataset that integrates the REALM corpus of LLM discussions, LinkedIn job postings, Indeed employment indices, and over 4 million LinkedIn user profiles, we analyze the relationship between discussion intensity across news media and Reddit forums and subsequent variations in job posting volumes, occupational net change ratios, job tenure patterns, unemployment duration, and transitions to GenAI-related roles across thirteen occupational categories. Our findings reveal that discussion intensity predicts employment changes 1-7 months in advance across multiple indicators, including job postings, net hiring rates, tenure patterns, and unemployment duration.

While most existing studies employ sequential Monte Carlo simulation and assume independent sampling of component failures, this oversimplification neglects the spatial correlations induced by meteorological factors such as hurricanes. In this paper, we identify and address the gap in modeling spatial dependence among component failures under extreme weather. We analyze how the mean, variance, and correlation structure of weather intensity random variables influence the correlation of component failures. To fill this gap, we propose a spatially dependent sampling method that enables joint sampling of multiple component failures by generating correlated meteorological intensity random variables. Comparative studies show that our approach captures long-tailed scenarios and reveals more extreme events than conventional methods. Furthermore, we evaluate the impact of scenario selection on preventive control performance. Our key findings are: (1) Strong spatial correlations in uncertain weather intensity consistently lead to interdependent component failures, regardless of mean value level; (2) The proposed method uncovers more high-severity scenarios that are missed by independent sampling; (3) Preventive control requires balancing load curtailment and over-generation costs under different scenario severities; (4) Ignoring failure correlations results in underestimating risk from high-severity events, undermining the robustness of preventive control strategies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8003\u8651\u7a7a\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7684\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u9884\u9632\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6c14\u8c61\u5f3a\u5ea6\u968f\u673a\u53d8\u91cf\u6765\u8054\u5408\u91c7\u6837\u591a\u4e2a\u7ec4\u4ef6\u6545\u969c\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u72ec\u7acb\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u53d1\u73b0\u66f4\u591a\u6781\u7aef\u4e8b\u4ef6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u987a\u5e8f\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6a21\u62df\u5e76\u5047\u8bbe\u7ec4\u4ef6\u6545\u969c\u72ec\u7acb\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u7b80\u5316\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u98d3\u98ce\u7b49\u6c14\u8c61\u56e0\u7d20\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u65e0\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u5efa\u6a21\u6781\u7aef\u5929\u6c14\u4e0b\u7684\u7ec4\u4ef6\u6545\u969c\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6c14\u8c61\u5f3a\u5ea6\u968f\u673a\u53d8\u91cf\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u4e2a\u7ec4\u4ef6\u6545\u969c\u7684\u8054\u5408\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6c14\u8c61\u5f3a\u5ea6\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u5747\u503c\u3001\u65b9\u5dee\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u7ec4\u4ef6\u6545\u969c\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u957f\u5c3e\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u63ed\u793a\u66f4\u591a\u6781\u7aef\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff1b\u5f3a\u7a7a\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u59cb\u7ec8\u5bfc\u81f4\u7ec4\u4ef6\u6545\u969c\u76f8\u4e92\u4f9d\u8d56\uff1b\u5ffd\u7565\u6545\u969c\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4f1a\u4f4e\u4f30\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u5a01\u80c1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9884\u9632\u63a7\u5236\u9700\u8981\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u573a\u666f\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0b\u5e73\u8861\u8d1f\u8377\u524a\u51cf\u548c\u53d1\u7535\u8fc7\u5269\u6210\u672c\uff1b\u5ffd\u7565\u6545\u969c\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4f1a\u524a\u5f31\u9884\u9632\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4f4e\u4f30\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u5a01\u80c1\u3002"}}

In this work, we introduce DynaMimicGen (D-MG), a scalable dataset generation framework that enables policy training from minimal human supervision while uniquely supporting dynamic task settings. Given only a few human demonstrations, D-MG first segments the demonstrations into meaningful sub-tasks, then leverages Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMPs) to adapt and generalize the demonstrated behaviors to novel and dynamically changing environments. Improving prior methods that rely on static assumptions or simplistic trajectory interpolation, D-MG produces smooth, realistic, and task-consistent Cartesian trajectories that adapt in real time to changes in object poses, robot states, or scene geometry during task execution. Our method supports different scenarios - including scene layouts, object instances, and robot configurations - making it suitable for both static and highly dynamic manipulation tasks. We show that robot agents trained via imitation learning on D-MG-generated data achieve strong performance across long-horizon and contact-rich benchmarks, including tasks like cube stacking and placing mugs in drawers, even under unpredictable environment changes. By eliminating the need for extensive human demonstrations and enabling generalization in dynamic settings, D-MG offers a powerful and efficient alternative to manual data collection, paving the way toward scalable, autonomous robot learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "DynaMimicGen (D-MG) \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u5c11\u91cf\u4eba\u7c7b\u6f14\u793a\u5c31\u80fd\u8bad\u7ec3\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u652f\u6301\u52a8\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u8bbe\u7f6e\u3002\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5272\u6f14\u793a\u4e3a\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u8fd0\u52a8\u57fa\u5143\u6765\u9002\u5e94\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6765\u5b66\u4e60\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4f46\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u8017\u65f6\u8d39\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4e0d\u5b9e\u7528\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u4ece\u5c11\u91cf\u4eba\u7c7b\u76d1\u7763\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u5e76\u9002\u5e94\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "D-MG\u9996\u5148\u5c06\u5c11\u91cf\u4eba\u7c7b\u6f14\u793a\u5206\u5272\u4e3a\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5229\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u8fd0\u52a8\u57fa\u5143(DMPs)\u6765\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6f14\u793a\u884c\u4e3a\u5230\u65b0\u9896\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u73af\u5883\u3002\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f9d\u8d56\u9759\u6001\u5047\u8bbe\u6216\u7b80\u5355\u8f68\u8ff9\u63d2\u503c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cD-MG\u751f\u6210\u5e73\u6ed1\u3001\u771f\u5b9e\u4e14\u4efb\u52a1\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u7b1b\u5361\u5c14\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528D-MG\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u5728\u957f\u89c6\u91ce\u548c\u63a5\u89e6\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u79ef\u6728\u5806\u53e0\u548c\u5c06\u676f\u5b50\u653e\u5165\u62bd\u5c49\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u4e0d\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\u4e5f\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u826f\u597d\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "D-MG\u901a\u8fc7\u6d88\u9664\u5bf9\u5927\u91cf\u4eba\u7c7b\u6f14\u793a\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u4e3a\u624b\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u800c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b66\u4e60\u94fa\u5e73\u4e86\u9053\u8def\u3002"}}

These issues become especially critical in human-computer interaction settings, where data quality, semantic reliability, and annotation consistency vary across users and recording conditions. This thesis tackles these challenges by exploring uncertainty-resilient multimodal learning through consistency-guided cross-modal transfer. The central idea is to use cross-modal semantic consistency as a basis for robust representation learning. By projecting heterogeneous modalities into a shared latent space, the proposed framework mitigates modality gaps and uncovers structural relations that support uncertainty estimation and stable feature learning. Building on this foundation, the thesis investigates strategies to enhance semantic robustness, improve data efficiency, and reduce the impact of noise and imperfect supervision without relying on large, high-quality annotations. Experiments on multimodal affect-recognition benchmarks demonstrate that consistency-guided cross-modal transfer significantly improves model stability, discriminative ability, and robustness to noisy or incomplete supervision. Latent space analyses further show that the framework captures reliable cross-modal structure even under challenging conditions. Overall, this thesis offers a unified perspective on resilient multimodal learning by integrating uncertainty modeling, semantic alignment, and data-efficient supervision, providing practical insights for developing reliable and adaptive brain-computer interface systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u8fc1\u79fb\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5f02\u6784\u6a21\u6001\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u5171\u4eab\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u6570\u636e\u3001\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u6807\u7b7e\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u5f02\u65f6\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u566a\u58f0\u6570\u636e\u3001\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u6807\u7b7e\u548c\u5f02\u6784\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6807\u6ce8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\u8f83\u5927\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u8fc1\u79fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u9c81\u68d2\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5c06\u5f02\u6784\u6a21\u6001\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u5171\u4eab\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u8ddd\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u652f\u6301\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u5224\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u6216\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u6311\u6218\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4e5f\u80fd\u6355\u83b7\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u53ef\u9760\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u8111\u673a\u63a5\u53e3\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

However, this view neglects the causal role of \"normative friction\": the complex system of administrative rules, exam validity windows, and prerequisite chains that constrain student progression. This paper introduces \"The Regularity Trap,\" a phenomenon where rigid assessment timelines decouple learning from accreditation. We operationalize the CAPIRE framework into a calibrated Agent-Based Model (ABM) simulating 1,343 student trajectories across a 42-course Civil Engineering curriculum. The model integrates empirical course parameters and thirteen psycho-academic archetypes derived from a 15-year longitudinal dataset. By formalizing the \"Regularity Regime\" as a decaying validity function, we isolate the effect of administrative time limits on attrition. Results reveal that 86.4% of observed dropouts are driven by normative mechanisms (expiry cascades) rather than purely academic failure (5.3%). While the overall dropout rate stabilized at 32.4%, vulnerability was highly heterogeneous: archetypes with myopic planning horizons faced attrition rates up to 49.0%, compared to 13.2% for strategic agents, despite comparable academic ability. These findings challenge the neutrality of administrative structures, suggesting that rigid validity windows act as an invisible filter that disproportionately penalizes students with lower self-regulatory capital.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e13\u4e1a\u9ad8\u8f8d\u5b66\u7387\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8e\u884c\u653f\u89c4\u5219\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\"\u89c4\u8303\u6027\u6469\u64e6\"\u800c\u975e\u5b66\u751f\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u53d1\u73b086.4%\u7684\u8f8d\u5b66\u7531\u884c\u653f\u65f6\u95f4\u9650\u5236\u9a71\u52a8\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5b66\u672f\u5931\u8d25\u3002", "motivation": "\u6311\u6218\u4f20\u7edf\u5c06\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e13\u4e1a\u9ad8\u8f8d\u5b66\u7387\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8e\u5b66\u751f\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u89c2\u70b9\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u884c\u653f\u89c4\u5219\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u8f8d\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u6a21\u578b(ABM)\uff0c\u6a21\u62df1,343\u540d\u5b66\u751f\u572842\u95e8\u571f\u6728\u5de5\u7a0b\u8bfe\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8bfe\u7a0b\u53c2\u6570\u548c13\u79cd\u5fc3\u7406-\u5b66\u672f\u539f\u578b\u3002", "result": "86.4%\u7684\u8f8d\u5b66\u7531\u89c4\u8303\u6027\u673a\u5236(\u6709\u6548\u671f\u7ea7\u8054)\u9a71\u52a8\uff0c\u4ec55.3%\u7531\u7eaf\u7cb9\u5b66\u672f\u5931\u8d25\u5bfc\u81f4\uff1b\u77ed\u89c6\u89c4\u5212\u539f\u578b\u7684\u8f8d\u5b66\u7387\u9ad8\u8fbe49.0%\uff0c\u800c\u7b56\u7565\u578b\u539f\u578b\u4ec513.2%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u884c\u653f\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u521a\u6027\u6709\u6548\u671f\u7a97\u53e3\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9690\u5f62\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5668\uff0c\u4e0d\u6210\u6bd4\u4f8b\u5730\u60e9\u7f5a\u81ea\u6211\u8c03\u8282\u80fd\u529b\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u5b66\u751f\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u884c\u653f\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u4e2d\u7acb\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u3002"}}

Nevertheless, this is a digital transformation, and the cyber-attack surface area has increased considerably, to the point that EV traction power electronics are becoming vulnerable to various cybersecurity risks. This paper is able to provide its expertise on possible cyber-attack vectors which can attack important parts of the traction, powertrain, including things like inverters, motor controllers, and communicated systems within the embedded bits. Using the (STRIDE) threat modeling framework, the research outlines and groups the vulnerabilities of the architecture and runs some attack simulations, such as the Denial of Service (DoS), spoofing, firmware manipulation, and data injection.

Existing model-centric optimization paths, such as model compression (which often leads to performance degradation) or policy distillation (whose products are model-dependent and lack generality), fail to fundamentally address this data-level challenge. To this end, this paper introduces FT-NCFM, a fundamentally different, data-centric generative data distillation framework. Our framework employs a self-contained Fact-Tracing (FT) engine that combines causal attribution with programmatic contrastive verification to assess the intrinsic value of samples. Guided by these assessments, an adversarial NCFM process synthesizes a model-agnostic, information-dense, and reusable data asset. Experimental results on several mainstream VLA benchmarks show that models trained on just 5% of our distilled coreset achieve a success rate of 85-90% compared with training on the full dataset, while reducing training time by over 80%. Our work demonstrates that intelligent data distillation is a highly promising new path for building efficient, high-performance VLA models.", "AI": {"tldr": "FT-NCFM\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u6570\u636e\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e8b\u5b9e\u8ffd\u8e2a\u5f15\u64ce\u8bc4\u4f30\u6837\u672c\u5185\u5728\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5408\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684\u53ef\u91cd\u7528\u6570\u636e\u8d44\u4ea7\uff0c\u4ec5\u75285%\u7684\u84b8\u998f\u6838\u5fc3\u96c6\u5c31\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u5168\u6570\u636e\u96c685-90%\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c1180%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u91cf\u5197\u4f59\u4e14\u4ef7\u503c\u4e0d\u5747\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u6216\u7b56\u7565\u84b8\u998f\u65e0\u6cd5\u4ece\u6839\u672c\u4e0a\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u636e\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e8b\u5b9e\u8ffd\u8e2a\u5f15\u64ce\u7ed3\u5408\u56e0\u679c\u5f52\u56e0\u548c\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5316\u5bf9\u6bd4\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u6837\u672c\u5185\u5728\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6297\u6027NCFM\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5408\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684\u53ef\u91cd\u7528\u6570\u636e\u8d44\u4ea7\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4e3b\u6d41VLA\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u75285%\u7684\u84b8\u998f\u6838\u5fc3\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5c31\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u5168\u6570\u636e\u96c685-90%\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c1180%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u667a\u80fd\u6570\u636e\u84b8\u998f\u662f\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u6548\u9ad8\u6027\u80fdVLA\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e00\u6761\u6781\u5177\u524d\u666f\u7684\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Moreover, their performance typically declines when addressing complex problems that require multi-step reasoning and analysis. In response to these challenges, we propose leveraging both LLMs and AI agents to develop education assistants aimed at enhancing undergraduate learning in biomechanics courses that focus on analyzing the force and moment in the musculoskeletal system of the human body. To achieve our goal, we construct a dual-module framework to enhance LLM performance in biomechanics educational tasks: 1) we apply Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to improve the specificity and logical consistency of LLM's responses to the conceptual true/false questions; 2) we build a Multi-Agent System (MAS) to solve calculation-oriented problems involving multi-step reasoning and code execution. Specifically, we evaluate the performance of several LLMs, i.e., Qwen-1.0-32B, Qwen-2.5-32B, and Llama-70B, on a biomechanics dataset comprising 100 true/false conceptual questions and problems requiring equation derivation and calculation. Our results demonstrate that RAG significantly enhances the performance and stability of LLMs in answering conceptual questions, surpassing those of vanilla models. On the other hand, the MAS constructed using multiple LLMs demonstrates its ability to perform multi-step reasoning, derive equations, execute code, and generate explainable solutions for tasks that require calculation. These findings demonstrate the potential of applying RAG and MAS to enhance LLM performance for specialized courses in engineering curricula, providing a promising direction for developing intelligent tutoring in engineering education.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53cc\u6a21\u5757\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210(RAG)\u548c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf(MAS)\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u7269\u529b\u5b66\u6559\u80b2\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3LLMs\u5728\u4e13\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0d\u8db3\u548c\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u5728\u901a\u7528\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4e13\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u9e3f\u6c9f\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u9700\u8981\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u590d\u6742\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u6559\u80b2\u52a9\u624b\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u672c\u79d1\u751f\u7269\u529b\u5b66\u8bfe\u7a0b\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u53cc\u6a21\u5757\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u4f7f\u7528RAG\u63d0\u5347LLMs\u5728\u6982\u5ff5\u6027\u5224\u65ad\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u4e13\u4e1a\u6027\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1b2) \u4f7f\u7528MAS\u89e3\u51b3\u9700\u8981\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u6267\u884c\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u591a\u4e2aLLM\u6a21\u578b\u5728100\u4e2a\u751f\u7269\u529b\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "RAG\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86LLMs\u5728\u6982\u5ff5\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u539f\u59cb\u6a21\u578b\u3002MAS\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u65b9\u7a0b\u63a8\u5bfc\u3001\u4ee3\u7801\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u8ba1\u7b97\u4efb\u52a1\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "RAG\u548cMAS\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u5e94\u7528\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u63d0\u5347LLMs\u5728\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e13\u4e1a\u8bfe\u7a0b\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u5de5\u7a0b\u6559\u80b2\u667a\u80fd\u8f85\u5bfc\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Conventional robot cameras, with their small apertures and large depth of field, render both foreground obstacles and background objects in sharp focus, causing occluders to obscure critical scene information. This work establishes a formal connection between animal peering and synthetic aperture (SA) sensing from optical imaging. By having a robot execute a peering motion, its camera describes a wide synthetic aperture. Computational integration of the captured images synthesizes an image with an extremely shallow depth of field, effectively blurring out occluding elements while bringing the background into sharp focus. This efficient, wavelength-independent technique enables real-time, high-resolution perception across various spectral bands. We demonstrate that this approach not only restores basic scene understanding but also empowers advanced visual reasoning in large multimodal models, which fail with conventionally occluded imagery. Unlike feature-dependent multi-view 3D vision methods or active sensors like LiDAR, SA sensing via peering is robust to occlusion, computationally efficient, and immediately deployable on any mobile robot.

Critically, multi-agent systems exhibit zero quality variance across all trials, enabling production SLA commitments impossible with inconsistent single-agent outputs. Both architectures achieve similar comprehension latency (approx.40s), establishing that the architectural value lies in deterministic quality, not speed. We introduce Decision Quality (DQ), a novel metric capturing validity, specificity, and correctness properties essential for operational deployment that existing LLM metrics do not address.

Based on variations of the Shelling model of segregation, we explored the propagation of thinking about others as equals (empathy) in students with and without $SEN$ in school environments. We use the complex systems approach for modeling possible scenarios of inclusiveness in which patterns of empathy between students emerge instead of the well-known behavior of segregation. Based on simple transitional rules, which are evaluated by a set of null models, we show the emergence of empathy between students in school environments.

This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication", "summary": "This paper presents Funabot-Upper, a wearable haptic suit that enables users to perceive 14 upper-body motions, including those of the trunk, shoulder, elbow, and wrist. Inducing kinesthetic perception through wearable haptic devices has attracted attention, and various devices have been developed in the past. However, these have been limited to verifications on single body parts, and few have applied the same method to multiple body parts as well. In our previous study, we developed a technology that uses the contraction of artificial muscles to deform clothing in three dimensions. Using this technology, we developed a haptic suit that induces kinesthetic perception of 7 motions in multiple upper body. However, perceptual mixing caused by stimulating multiple human muscles has occurred between the shoulder and the elbow. In this paper, we established a new, simplified design policy and developed a novel haptic suit that induces kinesthetic perceptions in the trunk, shoulder, elbow, and wrist by stimulating joints and muscles independently. We experimentally demonstrated the induced kinesthetic perception and examined the relationship between stimulation and perceived kinesthetic perception under the new design policy. Experiments confirmed that Funabot-Upper successfully induces kinesthetic perception across multiple joints while reducing perceptual mixing observed in previous designs. The new suit improved recognition accuracy from 68.8% to 94.6% compared to the previous Funabot-Suit, demonstrating its superiority and potential for future haptic applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "Funabot-Upper\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u89e6\u89c9\u5957\u88c5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u523a\u6fc0\u5173\u8282\u548c\u808c\u8089\u72ec\u7acb\u5730\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7528\u6237\u611f\u77e514\u79cd\u4e0a\u534a\u8eab\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u7248\u672c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u611f\u77e5\u6df7\u5408\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ece68.8%\u63d0\u5347\u523094.6%\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u89e6\u89c9\u8bbe\u5907\u4e3b\u8981\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u5355\u4e2a\u8eab\u4f53\u90e8\u4f4d\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5f88\u5c11\u6709\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u4e2a\u8eab\u4f53\u90e8\u4f4d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u5728\u80a9\u90e8\u548c\u8098\u90e8\u4e4b\u95f4\u51fa\u73b0\u4e86\u611f\u77e5\u6df7\u5408\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u7b80\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u65b0\u578b\u89e6\u89c9\u5957\u88c5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u72ec\u7acb\u523a\u6fc0\u5173\u8282\u548c\u808c\u8089\u6765\u8bf1\u5bfc\u8eaf\u5e72\u3001\u80a9\u90e8\u3001\u8098\u90e8\u548c\u8155\u90e8\u7684\u52a8\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u52a8\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u523a\u6fc0\u4e0e\u611f\u77e5\u52a8\u89c9\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b9eFunabot-Upper\u6210\u529f\u8bf1\u5bfc\u4e86\u591a\u4e2a\u5173\u8282\u7684\u52a8\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u4e4b\u524d\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u6df7\u5408\u3002\u4e0e\u4e4b\u524d\u7684Funabot-Suit\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u65b0\u5957\u88c5\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ece68.8%\u63d0\u9ad8\u5230\u4e8694.6%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b0\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u90e8\u4f4d\u89e6\u89c9\u523a\u6fc0\u4e2d\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u6df7\u5408\u95ee\u9898\uff0cFunabot-Upper\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u672a\u6765\u89e6\u89c9\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u548c\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

This gap is particularly problematic when AI systems are used in critical applications, such as the food supply, healthcare, utilities, law, insurance, and transport.\n  We survey the current state of AI risk assessment and management, with a focus on the supply chain of AI and risks relating to the behavior and outputs of the AI system. We then present a proposed taxonomy specifically for categorizing AI supply chain entities. This taxonomy helps stakeholders, especially those without extensive AI expertise, to \"consider the right questions\" and systematically inventory dependencies across their organization's AI systems. Our contribution bridges a gap between the current state of AI governance and the urgent need for actionable risk assessment and management of AI use in critical applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

For the PV2VC operational scenario, it would be more beneficial for long-distance vehicle routes with low initial state of charge, sparse charging facilities, and where travel time is perceived to be higher than energy consumption costs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f16\u961f\u7684\u8f66\u5bf9\u8f66\u5145\u7535\u6280\u672fPV2VC\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408\u6574\u6570\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u9057\u4f20\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u8f66\u8f86\u7684\u80fd\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5728Sioux Falls\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u53ef\u8282\u770111%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u7684\u80fd\u6e90\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u603b\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u8f66\u8f86\u5728\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u884c\u9a76\u4e2d\u5145\u7535\u8bbe\u65bd\u7a00\u758f\u3001\u521d\u59cb\u7535\u91cf\u4f4e\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5145\u7535\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u80fd\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u3001\u65c5\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u603b\u6210\u672c\u3002", "method": "\u5efa\u7acb\u6df7\u5408\u6574\u6570\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u9057\u4f20\u7b97\u6cd5\u6c42\u89e3\uff0c\u5728\u6539\u8fdb\u7684Sioux Falls\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e94\u7ec4\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u5546\u4e1a\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4e0e\u9057\u4f20\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u6700\u4f18\u57fa\u51c6\u573a\u666f\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cPV2VC\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u8282\u770111.07%\u80fd\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u300111.65%\u65c5\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u548c11.26%\u603b\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u3001\u4f4e\u521d\u59cb\u7535\u91cf\u3001\u5145\u7535\u8bbe\u65bd\u7a00\u758f\u4e14\u65f6\u95f4\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e8e\u80fd\u6e90\u6210\u672c\u7684\u573a\u666f\u3002", "conclusion": "PV2VC\u6280\u672f\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u8f66\u8f86\u7684\u8fd0\u8425\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u548c\u73af\u5883\u6548\u76ca\u3002"}}

Tube-based Model Predictive Control provides robust constraint satisfaction under bounded model uncertainties arising from approximation errors and external disturbances. The Random Fourier Features method approximates nonlinear system dynamics by solving a numerically tractable least-squares problem, thereby reducing the approximation error. We develop the integration of RFF-based residual learning with tube MPC and demonstrate its application to an autonomous vehicle path-tracking problem using a nonlinear bicycle model. Compared to the linear baseline, the proposed method reduces the tube size by approximately 50%, leading to less conservative behavior and resulting in around 70% smaller errors in the test scenario.

However, bipedal locomotion in different environments is still a challenge when it comes to performing stable and dynamic movements. This is where state estimation plays a crucial role, providing fast and accurate feedback of the robot's floating base state to the motion controller. Although classical state estimation methods such as Kalman filters are widely used in robotics, they require expert knowledge to fine-tune the noise parameters. Due to recent advances in the field of machine learning, deep learning methods are increasingly used for state estimation tasks. In this work, we propose the InEKFormer, a novel hybrid state estimation method that incorporates an invariant extended Kalman filter (InEKF) and a Transformer network. We compare our method with the InEKF and the KalmanNet approaches on datasets obtained from the humanoid robot RH5. The results indicate the potential of Transformers in humanoid state estimation, but also highlight the need for robust autoregressive training in these high-dimensional problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u4e0d\u53d8\u6269\u5c55\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u548cTransformer\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5InEKFormer\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4eba\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u5728RH5\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4eba\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u53cc\u8db3\u8fd0\u52a8\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u6027\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u5bf9\u8fd0\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u5bb6\u77e5\u8bc6\u8c03\u6574\u566a\u58f0\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u800c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faInEKFormer\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e0d\u53d8\u6269\u5c55\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668(InEKF)\u548cTransformer\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5229\u7528InEKF\u5904\u7406\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u7ea6\u675f\uff0cTransformer\u7f51\u7edc\u5b66\u4e60\u6b8b\u5dee\u8865\u507f\u3002", "result": "\u5728RH5\u4eba\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86InEKFormer\u3001InEKF\u548cKalmanNet\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660eTransformer\u5728\u4eba\u5f62\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u9ad8\u7ef4\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "conclusion": "Transformer\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u4eba\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u9ad8\u7ef4\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

This study presents a comparative analysis of NLP low-compute rule-based methods and Large Language Models (LLMs) for information extraction from electronic health records (EHR) obtained from the Voivodeship Rehabilitation Hospital for Children in Ameryka, Poland. We evaluate both approaches by extracting patient demographics, clinical findings, and prescribed medications while examining the effects of lack of text normalisation and translation-induced information loss. Results demonstrate that rule-based methods provide higher accuracy in information retrieval tasks, particularly for age and sex extraction. However, LLMs offer greater adaptability and scalability, excelling in drug name recognition. The effectiveness of the LLMs was compared with texts originally in Polish and those translated into English, assessing the impact of translation. These findings highlight the trade-offs between accuracy, normalisation, and computational cost when deploying NLP in healthcare settings.

The system is formulated as a hybrid singularly perturbed dynamical system, enabling the systematic use of singular perturbation techniques to derive explicit bounds on the maximum allowable transmission intervals (MATI) for both fast and slow communication channels. Under the resulting conditions, the proposed observer guarantees that the estimation error satisfies a global exponential derivative-input-to-state stability (DISS)-like property, where the ultimate bound scales proportionally with the magnitudes of the measurement noise and the time derivative of the control input. The effectiveness of the approach is illustrated through a numerical example.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eff\u771f\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5904\u7406\u5177\u6709\u6d4b\u91cf\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u53cc\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7ebf\u6027\u7f51\u7edc\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408\u5947\u5f02\u6444\u52a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u5efa\u6a21\u548cMATI\u8fb9\u754c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\u6ee1\u8db3\u5168\u5c40\u6307\u6570\u5bfc\u6570\u8f93\u5165\u5230\u72b6\u6001\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5728\u6d4b\u91cf\u566a\u58f0\u5b58\u5728\u4e0b\uff0c\u53cc\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7ebf\u6027\u7f51\u7edc\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5982\u4f55\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u7cfb\u7edf\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u6df7\u5408\u5947\u5f02\u6444\u52a8\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5947\u5f02\u6444\u52a8\u6280\u672f\u63a8\u5bfc\u5feb\u6162\u901a\u4fe1\u4fe1\u9053\u7684\u6700\u5927\u5141\u8bb8\u4f20\u8f93\u95f4\u9694\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6ee1\u8db3DISS\u7279\u6027\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u5668\u80fd\u591f\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\u6ee1\u8db3\u5168\u5c40\u6307\u6570DISS\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5176\u6700\u7ec8\u8fb9\u754c\u4e0e\u6d4b\u91cf\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u8f93\u5165\u65f6\u95f4\u5bfc\u6570\u7684\u5927\u5c0f\u6210\u6bd4\u4f8b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u793a\u4f8b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u53cc\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7f51\u7edc\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b58\u5728\u6d4b\u91cf\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, this model-free paradigm often risks instability and unsafe exploration due to the time-varying nature of impedance gains. This work introduces Certified Gaussian Manifold Sampling (C-GMS), a novel trajectory-centric RL framework that learns combined DMP and VIC policies while guaranteeing Lyapunov stability and actuator feasibility by construction. Our approach reframes policy exploration as sampling from a mathematically defined manifold of stable gain schedules. This ensures every policy rollout is guaranteed to be stable and physically realizable, thereby eliminating the need for reward penalties or post-hoc validation. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical guarantee that our approach ensures bounded tracking error even in the presence of bounded model errors and deployment-time uncertainties. We demonstrate the effectiveness of C-GMS in simulation and verify its efficacy on a real robot, paving the way for reliable autonomous interaction in complex environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86C-GMS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91c7\u6837\u7a33\u5b9a\u589e\u76ca\u6d41\u5f62\u6765\u5b66\u4e60DMP\u548cVIC\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u674e\u96c5\u666e\u8bfa\u592b\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6267\u884c\u5668\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5956\u52b1\u60e9\u7f5a\u6216\u540e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65e0\u6a21\u578b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u534f\u4f5c\u6280\u80fd\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u963b\u6297\u589e\u76ca\u7684\u65f6\u53d8\u7279\u6027\u3002", "method": "C-GMS\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u7b56\u7565\u63a2\u7d22\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u4ece\u6570\u5b66\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u589e\u76ca\u6d41\u5f62\u4e2d\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7b56\u7565\u90e8\u7f72\u90fd\u662f\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u7269\u7406\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u6709\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4e5f\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6709\u754c\u8ddf\u8e2a\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "C-GMS\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u81ea\u4e3b\u4ea4\u4e92\u94fa\u5e73\u4e86\u9053\u8def\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Specialized agents evaluate localization quality, generate Socratic coaching, retrieve PubMed evidence, suggest similar cases from REFLACX, and trigger NV-Reason-CXR-3B for vision-language reasoning when mastery remains low or the learner explicitly asks. Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) maintains skill-specific mastery estimates that drive both knowledge reinforcement and case similarity retrieval. A lung-lobe segmentation module derived from a TensorFlow U-Net enables anatomically aware gaze feedback, and safety prompts prevent premature disclosure of ground-truth labels.

However, their inherent tendency toward hallucination often introduces functional errors into the generated HDL designs. To address this issue, we propose the framework CorrectHDL that leverages high-level synthesis (HLS) results as functional references to correct potential errors in LLM-generated HDL designs.The input to the proposed framework is a C/C++ program that specifies the target circuit's functionality. The program is provided to an LLM to directly generate an HDL design, whose syntax errors are repaired using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mechanism. The functional correctness of the LLM-generated circuit is iteratively improved by comparing its simulated behavior with an HLS reference design produced by conventional HLS tools, which ensures the functional correctness of the result but can lead to suboptimal area and power efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that circuits generated by the proposed framework achieve significantly better area and power efficiency than conventional HLS designs and approach the quality of human-engineered circuits. Meanwhile, the correctness of the resulting HDL implementation is maintained, highlighting the effectiveness and potential of agentic HDL design leveraging the generative capabilities of LLMs and the rigor of traditional correctness-driven IC design flows.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faCorrectHDL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528HLS\u7ed3\u679c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u529f\u80fd\u53c2\u8003\u6765\u4fee\u6b63LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684HDL\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u529f\u80fd\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u9762\u79ef\u548c\u529f\u8017\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3LLM\u5728\u786c\u4ef6\u524d\u7aef\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u56e0\u5e7b\u89c9\u503e\u5411\u5bfc\u81f4HDL\u8bbe\u8ba1\u51fa\u73b0\u529f\u80fd\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528C/C++\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7LLM\u751f\u6210HDL\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u7528RAG\u673a\u5236\u4fee\u590d\u8bed\u6cd5\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0eHLS\u53c2\u8003\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u884c\u4e3a\u6bd4\u8f83\u6765\u8fed\u4ee3\u6539\u8fdb\u529f\u80fd\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7535\u8def\u5728\u9762\u79ef\u548c\u529f\u8017\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfHLS\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u63a5\u8fd1\u4eba\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301HDL\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "CorrectHDL\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86LLM\u7684\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u4f20\u7edf\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u9a71\u52a8\u7684IC\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4ee3\u7406\u5f0fHDL\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

Previous solutions have made progress in explicitly modeling the dynamic obstacle motion for avoidance, but this key dependency of decision-making is time-consuming and unreliable in highly dynamic scenarios with occlusions. On the contrary, without introducing object detection, tracking, and prediction, we empower the reinforcement learning (RL) with single LiDAR sensing to realize an autonomous flight system directly from point to motion. For exteroception, a depth sensing distance map achieving fixed-shape, low-resolution, and detail-safe is encoded from raw point clouds, and an environment change sensing point flow is adopted as motion features extracted from multi-frame observations. These two are integrated into a lightweight and easy-to-learn representation of complex dynamic environments. For action generation, the behavior of avoiding dynamic threats in advance is implicitly driven by the proposed change-aware sensing representation, where the policy optimization is indicated by the relative motion modulated distance field. With the deployment-friendly sensing simulation and dynamics model-free acceleration control, the proposed system shows a superior success rate and adaptability to alternatives, and the policy derived from the simulator can drive a real-world quadrotor with safe maneuvers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5355\u6fc0\u5149\u96f7\u8fbe\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u907f\u969c\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u8ddd\u79bb\u56fe\u548c\u70b9\u6d41\u8fd0\u52a8\u7279\u5f81\u6765\u8868\u5f81\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u969c\u788d\u7269\u8fd0\u52a8\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u4e3b\u98de\u884c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u969c\u788d\u7269\u8fd0\u52a8\u8017\u65f6\u4e14\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u906e\u6321\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u9ad8\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u8ddf\u8e2a\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u611f\u77e5\u5230\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u6fc0\u5149\u96f7\u8fbe\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u5c06\u539f\u59cb\u70b9\u4e91\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u56fa\u5b9a\u5f62\u72b6\u3001\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e14\u4fdd\u7559\u7ec6\u8282\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u8ddd\u79bb\u56fe\uff0c\u5e76\u4ece\u591a\u5e27\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u70b9\u6d41\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8fd0\u52a8\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u7279\u5f81\u96c6\u6210\u5f62\u6210\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u73af\u5883\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u76f8\u5bf9\u8fd0\u52a8\u8c03\u5236\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u573a\u8fdb\u884c\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u90e8\u7f72\u53cb\u597d\u7684\u4f20\u611f\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u65e0\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u52a0\u901f\u63a7\u5236\u4e0b\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u6bd4\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u63a8\u5bfc\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u56db\u65cb\u7ffc\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u52a8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u53d8\u5316\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4f20\u611f\u8868\u793a\u9690\u5f0f\u9a71\u52a8\u907f\u969c\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u663e\u5f0f\u8fd0\u52a8\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u6742\u4e71\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u98de\u884c\u3002"}}

Practical domains, such as business management, require optimizing an open-ended and multi-faceted objective, actively learning environment dynamics from sparse experience, planning over long horizons in stochastic settings, and reasoning over spatial information. Yet existing human--AI benchmarks isolate subsets of these capabilities, limiting our ability to assess holistic decision-making competence. We introduce Mini Amusement Parks (MAPs), an amusement-park simulator designed to evaluate an agent's ability to model its environment, anticipate long-term consequences under uncertainty, and strategically operate a complex business. We provide human baselines and a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLM agents, finding that humans outperform these systems by 6.5x on easy mode and 9.8x on medium mode. Our analysis reveals persistent weaknesses in long-horizon optimization, sample-efficient learning, spatial reasoning, and world modelling. By unifying these challenges within a single environment, MAPs offers a new foundation for benchmarking agents capable of adaptable decision making.

In humans, this self-monitoring or metacognition is crucial for learning, decision making and problem solving. For instance, they can evaluate how confident they are in performing a task, thus regulating their own behavior and allocating proper resources. Taking inspiration from neuroscience, we propose a robot metacognition architecture centered on confidence (a second-order judgment on decisions) and we demonstrate it on the use case of autonomous tool invention. We propose the use of confidence as a metacognitive measure within the robot decision making scheme. Confidence-informed robots can evaluate the reliability of their decisions, improving their robustness during real-world physical deployment. This form of robotic metacognition emphasizes embodied action monitoring as a means to achieve better informed decisions.

We introduce Step-Audio-R1, the first audio reasoning model that successfully unlocks reasoning capabilities in the audio domain. Through our proposed Modality-Grounded Reasoning Distillation (MGRD) framework, Step-Audio-R1 learns to generate audio-relevant reasoning chains that genuinely ground themselves in acoustic features rather than hallucinating disconnected deliberations. Our model exhibits strong audio reasoning capabilities, surpassing Gemini 2.5 Pro and achieving performance comparable to the state-of-the-art Gemini 3 Pro across comprehensive audio understanding and reasoning benchmarks spanning speech, environmental sounds, and music. These results demonstrate that reasoning is a transferable capability across modalities when appropriately anchored, transforming extended deliberation from a liability into a powerful asset for audio intelligence.

This paper proposes a novel homogeneous Proportional-Integral-Derivative (hPID) control strategy tailored for MRMs to achieve robust and coordinated motion control. Unlike classical PID controllers, the hPID controller leverages the mathematical framework of homogeneous control theory to systematically enhance the stability and convergence properties of the closed-loop system, even in the presence of dynamic uncertainties and external disturbances involved into a system in a homogeneous way. A homogeneous PID structure is designed, ensuring improved convergence of tracking errors through a graded homogeneity approach that generalizes traditional PID gains to nonlinear, state-dependent functions. Stability analysis is conducted using Lyapunov-based methods, demonstrating that the hPID controller guarantees global asymptotic stability and finite-time convergence under mild assumptions. Experimental results on a representative MRM model validate the effectiveness of the hPID controller in achieving high-precision trajectory tracking for both the mobile base and manipulator arm, outperforming conventional linear PID controllers in terms of response time, steady-state error, and robustness to model uncertainties.

Although incorporating action supervision can alleviate these distractions, its effectiveness is restricted by the scarcity of available action labels. Optical flow represents pixel-level motion between consecutive frames, naturally suppressing background elements and emphasizing moving objects. Motivated by this, we propose robust Latent Action learning with Optical Flow constraints, called LAOF, a pseudo-supervised framework that leverages the agent's optical flow as an action-driven signal to learn latent action representations robust to distractors. Experimental results show that the latent representations learned by LAOF outperform existing methods on downstream imitation learning and reinforcement learning tasks. This superior performance arises from optical flow constraints, which substantially stabilize training and improve the quality of latent representations under extremely label-scarce conditions, while remaining effective as the proportion of action labels increases to 10 percent.

Prior work on LLM-as-a-judge frameworks typically relies on comparing candidate answers against ground-truth labels or other candidate answers using predefined metrics like entailment. However, this approach is inherently indirect and difficult to fully automate, offering limited support for fine-grained and scalable evaluation of reasoning outputs. In this work, we propose JudgeBoard, a novel evaluation pipeline that directly queries models to assess the correctness of candidate answers without requiring extra answer comparisons. We focus on two core reasoning domains: mathematical reasoning and science/commonsense reasoning, and construct task-specific evaluation leaderboards using both accuracy-based ranking and an Elo-based rating system across five benchmark datasets, enabling consistent model comparison as judges rather than comparators. To improve judgment performance in lightweight models, we propose MAJ (Multi-Agent Judging), a novel multi-agent evaluation framework that leverages multiple interacting SLMs with distinct reasoning profiles to approximate LLM-level judgment accuracy through collaborative deliberation. Experimental results reveal a significant performance gap between SLMs and LLMs in isolated judging tasks. However, our MAJ framework substantially improves the reliability and consistency of SLMs. On the MATH dataset, MAJ using smaller-sized models as backbones performs comparatively well or even better than their larger-sized counterparts.

To address these challenges, we propose KRAL (Knowledge and Reasoning Augmented Learning), a low-cost, scalable, privacy-preserving paradigm that leverages teacher-model reasoning to automatically distill knowledge and reasoning trajectories via answer-to-question reverse generation, employs heuristic learning for semi-supervised data augmentation (reducing manual annotation requirements by approximately 80%), and utilizes agentic reinforcement learning to jointly enhance medical knowledge and reasoning while optimizing computational and memory efficiency. A hierarchical evaluation employing diverse teacher-model proxies reduces assessment costs, while modular interface design facilitates seamless system updates. Experimental results demonstrate that KRAL significantly outperforms traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) methods. It improves knowledge question-answering capability (Accuracy@1 on the external open-source benchmark MEDQA increased by 1.8% vs. SFT and 3.6% vs. RAG) and reasoning capability (Pass@1 on the external benchmark PUMCH Antimicrobial increased by 27% vs. SFT and 27.2% vs. RAG), achieved at ~20% of SFT's long-term training costs.

While current VLA models have shown the strong effectiveness of large-scale real-robot pre-training, synthetic data has not previously demonstrated comparable capability at scale. This paper provides the first evidence that synthetic data alone can match the performance of the strongest $\u03c0$-dataset in pre-training a VLA model, revealing the substantial value of large-scale simulation. The resulting model also exhibits surprisingly zero-shot sim-to-real transfer on several challenging tasks. Our synthetic dataset, InternData-A1, contains over 630k trajectories and 7,433 hours across 4 embodiments, 18 skills, 70 tasks, and 227 scenes, covering rigid, articulated, deformable, and fluid-object manipulation.

Achieving this would mark significant progress toward generalizable robot manipulation in human environments, as it would reduce the reliance on labor-intensive robot data collection. Despite substantial efforts, progress toward this goal has been bottle-necked by the embodiment gap between humans and robots, as well as by difficulties in extracting relevant contextual and motion cues that enable learning of autonomous policies from in-the-wild human videos. We claim that with simple yet sufficiently powerful hardware for obtaining human data and our proposed framework AINA, we are now one significant step closer to achieving this dream. AINA enables learning multi-fingered policies from data collected by anyone, anywhere, and in any environment using Aria Gen 2 glasses. These glasses are lightweight and portable, feature a high-resolution RGB camera, provide accurate on-board 3D head and hand poses, and offer a wide stereo view that can be leveraged for depth estimation of the scene. This setup enables the learning of 3D point-based policies for multi-fingered hands that are robust to background changes and can be deployed directly without requiring any robot data (including online corrections, reinforcement learning, or simulation). We compare our framework against prior human-to-robot policy learning approaches, ablate our design choices, and demonstrate results across nine everyday manipulation tasks.

Despite its large success in scheduling, only three Constraint Programming (CP) models have been proposed for this problem considering minimum batch sizes, which is a common requirement in many practical settings, including the ion implantation area in semiconductor manufacturing. These existing CP models rely on a predefined virtual set of possible batches that suffers from the curse of dimensionality and adds complexity to the problem. This paper proposes a novel CP model that does not rely on this virtual set. Instead, it uses key alignment parameters that allow it to reason directly on the sequences of same-family jobs scheduled on the machines, resulting in a more compact formulation. This new model is further improved by exploiting the problem's structure with tailored search phases and strengthened inference levels of the constraint propagators. The extensive computational experiments on nearly five thousand instances compare the proposed models against existing methods in the literature, including mixed-integer programming formulations, tabu search meta-heuristics, and CP approaches.

We design a hybrid architecture, combining two powerful tools: the CNN LSTM model for time series forecasting and an orchestrator based on multi agent Deep Reinforcement Learning In fact the novelty is in how we combine them as we embed the predictive forecast from the CNN LSTM directly into the DRL agent state space.

To address these gaps, we propose MR-RML (Multidimensional Rubric-oriented Reward Model Learning) via GPRC (Geometric Projection Reference Constraints), a novel alignment framework that integrates medical standards into a structured \"Dimensions-Scenarios-Disciplines\" matrix to guide data generation and model optimization. MR-RML introduces three core innovations: (1) a \"Dimensions-Scenarios-Disciplines\" medical standard system that embeds domain standards into the full training pipeline; (2) an independent multi-dimensional reward model that decomposes evaluation criteria, shifting from real-time rubric-based scoring to internalized reward modeling for improved consistency and cost-efficiency; (3) geometric projection reference constraints that transform medical cognitive logic into mathematical regularization, aligning scoring gradients with clinical reasoning and enabling synthetic data-driven training. Through extensive evaluations on the authoritative medical benchmark Healthbench, our method yields substantial performance gains over the base LLM Qwen-32B (45% on the full subset and 85% on Hard subset, respectively).

The annotation of structured sequences of events (who does what, when, and where) used for soccer analytics requires a holistic approach that integrates both STAD and MOT. However, current action recognition methods remain insufficient for constructing reliable play-by-play data and are typically used to assist rather than fully automate annotation. Parallel research has advanced tactical modeling, trajectory forecasting, and performance analysis, all grounded in game-state and play-by-play data. This motivates leveraging tactical knowledge as a prior to support computer-vision-based predictions, enabling more automated and reliable extraction of play-by-play data. We introduce Footovision Play-by-Play Action Spotting in Soccer Dataset (FOOTPASS), the first benchmark for play-by-play action spotting over entire soccer matches in a multi-modal, multi-agent tactical context. It enables the development of methods for player-centric action spotting that exploit both outputs from computer-vision tasks (e.g., tracking, identification) and prior knowledge of soccer, including its tactical regularities over long time horizons, to generate reliable play-by-play data streams. These streams form an essential input for data-driven sports analytics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86FOOTPASS\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u5728\u8db3\u7403\u6bd4\u8d5b\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u3001\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6218\u672f\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u9010\u573a\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u51fa\u548c\u8db3\u7403\u6218\u672f\u77e5\u8bc6\u6765\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u9010\u573a\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u8db3\u7403\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u9010\u573a\u6570\u636e\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u4e0d\u8db3\u591f\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u53ea\u80fd\u8f85\u52a9\u800c\u975e\u5b8c\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6807\u6ce8\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u6218\u672f\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u7b49\u7814\u7a76\u9700\u8981\u57fa\u4e8e\u6bd4\u8d5b\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u9010\u573a\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5229\u7528\u6218\u672f\u77e5\u8bc6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5148\u9a8c\u6765\u652f\u6301\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165FOOTPASS\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5f00\u53d1\u7403\u5458\u4e2d\u5fc3\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e2\u5229\u7528\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u8f93\u51fa\uff08\u5982\u8ddf\u8e2a\u3001\u8bc6\u522b\uff09\uff0c\u4e5f\u5229\u7528\u8db3\u7403\u6218\u672f\u77e5\u8bc6\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u957f\u671f\u6218\u672f\u89c4\u5f8b\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u8986\u76d6\u6574\u573a\u8db3\u7403\u6bd4\u8d5b\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u3001\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6218\u672f\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u9010\u573a\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "conclusion": "FOOTPASS\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u9010\u573a\u6570\u636e\u6d41\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u662f\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u4f53\u80b2\u5206\u6790\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u9010\u573a\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u53d6\u3002"}}

Yet this rapid progress is largely performance-driven and opaque. Current LLM-based approaches rarely reveal why a generated algorithm works, which components matter or how design choices relate to underlying problem structures. This paper argues that the next breakthrough will come not from more automation, but from coupling automation with understanding from systematic benchmarking. We outline a vision for explainable automated algorithm design, built on three pillars: (i) LLM-driven discovery of algorithmic variants, (ii) explainable benchmarking that attributes performance to components and hyperparameters and (iii) problem-class descriptors that connect algorithm behaviour to landscape structure. Together, these elements form a closed knowledge loop in which discovery, explanation and generalisation reinforce each other. We argue that this integration will shift the field from blind search to interpretable, class-specific algorithm design, accelerating progress while producing reusable scientific insight into when and why optimisation strategies succeed.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u613f\u666f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u53d1\u73b0\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u95ee\u9898\u7c7b\u522b\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ece\u76f2\u76ee\u641c\u7d22\u5230\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u7c7b\u522b\u7279\u5b9a\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u8f6c\u53d8\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u6027\u80fd\u800c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u63ed\u793a\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e3a\u4f55\u6709\u6548\u3001\u54ea\u4e9b\u7ec4\u4ef6\u91cd\u8981\u6216\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\u4e0e\u95ee\u9898\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e09\u4e2a\u652f\u67f1\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u77e5\u8bc6\u5faa\u73af\uff1aLLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u53d8\u4f53\u53d1\u73b0\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff08\u5c06\u6027\u80fd\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8e\u7ec4\u4ef6\u548c\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\uff09\u3001\u95ee\u9898\u7c7b\u522b\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\uff08\u8fde\u63a5\u7b97\u6cd5\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u666f\u89c2\u7ed3\u6784\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u63a8\u52a8\u9886\u57df\u4ece\u76f2\u76ee\u641c\u7d22\u8f6c\u5411\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u7c7b\u522b\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4ea7\u751f\u5173\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u4f55\u65f6\u53ca\u4e3a\u4f55\u6210\u529f\u7684\u53ef\u91cd\u7528\u79d1\u5b66\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u7a81\u7834\u4e0d\u662f\u6765\u81ea\u66f4\u591a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u5c06\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u53d1\u73b0\u3001\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u76f8\u4e92\u52a0\u5f3a\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u77e5\u8bc6\u5faa\u73af\u3002"}}

Conventional reward models struggle to jointly optimize multiple, sometimes conflicting, preference dimensions (e.g., factuality, helpfulness, safety) and offer limited transparency into why a score is assigned. CRM addresses these issues by decomposing preference evaluation into domain-specific agents that each produce partial signals, alongside global evaluators such as ranker-based and embedding-similarity rewards. A centralized aggregator fuses these signals at each timestep, balancing factors like step-wise correctness, multi-agent agreement, and repetition penalties, yielding a single training reward compatible with standard RL pipelines. The policy is optimized with advantage-based updates (e.g., GAE), while a value model regresses to the aggregated reward, enabling multi-perspective reward shaping without requiring additional human annotations beyond those used to train the evaluators. To support training and assessment, we introduce rewardBench, a benchmark and training suite aligned with the collaborative structure of CRM.

We introduce ChemO, a new benchmark built from the International Chemistry Olympiad (IChO) 2025. ChemO features two key innovations for automated assessment: Assessment-Equivalent Reformulation (AER), which converts problems requiring visual outputs (e.g., drawing molecules) into computationally tractable formats, and Structured Visual Enhancement (SVE), a diagnostic mechanism to disentangle a model's visual perception capabilities from its core chemical reasoning. To tackle this benchmark, we propose ChemLabs, a hierarchical multi-agent framework that mimics human expert collaboration through specialized agents for problem decomposition, perception, reasoning, and auditing. Experiments on state-of-the-art multimodal models demonstrate that combining SVE with our multi-agent system yields dramatic performance gains. Our top configuration achieves a score of 93.6 out of 100, surpassing an estimated human gold medal threshold and establishing a new state-of-the-art in automated chemical problem-solving.

At the same time, textbooks and exercise materials contain abundant, high-quality human-authored Question-Answer(QA) content that remains underexploited due to the difficulty of transforming raw PDFs into AI-ready supervision. Although modern OCR and vision-language models can accurately parse document structure, their outputs lack the semantic alignment required for training. We propose an automated pipeline that extracts well-formed QA and visual-QA (VQA) pairs from educational documents by combining layout-aware OCR with LLM-based semantic parsing. Experiments across diverse document types show that the method produces accurate, aligned, and low-noise QA/VQA pairs. This approach enables scalable use of real-world educational content and provides a practical alternative to synthetic data generation for improving reasoning-oriented LLM training.

We make threefold contributions. First, we conduct a comprehensive empirical analysis and uncover that item lifecycles in short-video platforms follow a compressed three-phase pattern, i.e., rapid growth, transient stability, and sharp decay, which significantly deviates from the classical four-stage model (introduction, growth, maturity, decline). Second, we introduce LHRL, a lifecycle-aware hierarchical reinforcement learning framework that dynamically harmonizes fairness and accuracy by leveraging phase-specific exposure dynamics. LHRL consists of two key components: (1) PhaseFormer, a lightweight encoder combining STL decomposition and attention mechanisms for robust phase detection; (2) a two-level HRL agent, where the high-level policy imposes phase-aware fairness constraints, and the low-level policy optimizes immediate user engagement. This decoupled optimization allows for effective reconciliation between long-term equity and short-term utility. Third, experiments on multiple real-world interactive recommendation datasets demonstrate that LHRL significantly improves both fairness and user engagement. Furthermore, the integration of lifecycle-aware rewards into existing RL-based models consistently yields performance gains, highlighting the generalizability and practical value of our approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u9879\u76ee\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65b0\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u4e86\u516c\u5e73\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86LHRL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u9636\u6bb5\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u66dd\u5149\u52a8\u6001\u6765\u52a8\u6001\u5e73\u8861\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u7528\u6237\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u516c\u5e73\u611f\u77e5\u4ea4\u4e92\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u77ed\u89c6\u9891\u5e73\u53f0\u4e2d\u9879\u76ee\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u5448\u73b0\u538b\u7f29\u7684\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u6a21\u5f0f\uff08\u5feb\u901f\u589e\u957f\u3001\u77ed\u6682\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u6025\u5267\u8870\u51cf\uff09\uff0c\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u56db\u9636\u6bb5\u6a21\u578b\u663e\u8457\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLHRL\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) PhaseFormer - \u7ed3\u5408STL\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7528\u4e8e\u9c81\u68d2\u9636\u6bb5\u68c0\u6d4b\uff1b2) \u4e24\u7ea7HRL\u4ee3\u7406 - \u9ad8\u5c42\u7b56\u7565\u65bd\u52a0\u9636\u6bb5\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u4f4e\u5c42\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u5373\u65f6\u7528\u6237\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u957f\u671f\u516c\u5e73\u4e0e\u77ed\u671f\u6548\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u8026\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4ea4\u4e92\u63a8\u8350\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLHRL\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u7528\u6237\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u3002\u5c06\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u611f\u77e5\u5956\u52b1\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eRL\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4e5f\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u83b7\u5f97\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9879\u76ee\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u662f\u4f18\u5316\u516c\u5e73\u611f\u77e5\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6709\u6548\u63a7\u5236\u53d8\u91cf\uff0cLHRL\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u534f\u8c03\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u611f\u77e5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

The prototype explores how multiple organisations (represented here as a Clinic, Insurer, and Specialist Network) can cooperate securely via pseudonymised case tokens, local data lookups, and controlled operational boundaries.\n  The system uses Orpius as the underlying platform for multi-agent orchestration, tool execution, and privacy-preserving communication. All agents communicate through OperationRelay calls, exchanging concise natural-language summaries. Each agent operates on its own data (such as synthetic clinic records, insurance enrolment tables, and clinical guidance extracts), and none receives or reconstructs patient identity. The Clinic computes an HMAC-based pseudonymous token, the Insurer evaluates coverage rules and consults the Specialist agent, and the Specialist returns an appropriateness recommendation.\n  The goal of this prototype is intentionally limited: to demonstrate feasibility, not to provide a clinically validated, production-ready system. No clinician review was conducted, and no evaluation beyond basic functional runs was performed. The work highlights architectural patterns, privacy considerations, and communication flows that enable distributed reasoning among specialised agents while keeping data local to each organisation. We conclude by outlining opportunities for more rigorous evaluation and future research in decentralised multi-agent systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6d88\u606f\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u95f4\u901a\u4fe1\u6982\u5ff5\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5047\u540d\u5316\u4ee4\u724c\u548c\u672c\u5730\u6570\u636e\u67e5\u8be2\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5b89\u5168\u534f\u4f5c\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u591a\u4e2a\u7ec4\u7ec7\uff08\u8bca\u6240\u3001\u4fdd\u9669\u516c\u53f8\u3001\u4e13\u79d1\u7f51\u7edc\uff09\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u4e0d\u5171\u4eab\u6807\u8bc6\u7b26\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6a21\u5f0f\u6216\u96c6\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u4ea4\u6362\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5047\u540d\u5316\u6848\u4f8b\u4ee4\u724c\u548c\u672c\u5730\u6570\u636e\u67e5\u8be2\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b89\u5168\u534f\u4f5c\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Orpius\u5e73\u53f0\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7f16\u6392\u3001\u5de5\u5177\u6267\u884c\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7OperationRelay\u8c03\u7528\u4ea4\u6362\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6458\u8981\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4ec5\u64cd\u4f5c\u672c\u5730\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528HMAC\u5047\u540d\u5316\u4ee4\u724c\u4fdd\u62a4\u60a3\u8005\u8eab\u4efd\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u6f14\u793a\u4e86\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u67b6\u6784\u6a21\u5f0f\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u8003\u91cf\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u4f46\u672a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e34\u5e8a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6216\u8d85\u51fa\u57fa\u672c\u529f\u80fd\u8fd0\u884c\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u539f\u578b\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u66f4\u4e25\u683c\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6570\u636e\u672c\u5730\u5316\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e13\u4e1a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002"}}

However, despite notable progress in visual reasoning, the lack of transparent and reproducible data curation and training strategies remains a major barrier to scalable research. In this work, we introduce OpenMMReasoner, a fully transparent two-stage recipe for multimodal reasoning spanning supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). In the SFT stage, we construct an 874K-sample cold-start dataset with rigorous step-by-step validation, providing a strong foundation for reasoning capabilities. The subsequent RL stage leverages a 74K-sample dataset across diverse domains to further sharpen and stabilize these abilities, resulting in a more robust and efficient learning process. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our training recipe not only surpasses strong baselines but also highlights the critical role of data quality and training design in shaping multimodal reasoning performance. Notably, our method achieves a 11.6% improvement over the Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct baseline across nine multimodal reasoning benchmarks, establishing a solid empirical foundation for future large-scale multimodal reasoning research.

In this work, we propose a novel agent-based method for automatic validation of optimization models that builds upon and extends methods from software testing to address optimization modeling . This method consists of several agents that initially generate a problem-level testing API, then generate tests utilizing this API, and, lastly, generate mutations specific to the optimization model (a well-known software testing technique assessing the fault detection power of the test suite). In this work, we detail this validation framework and show, through experiments, the high quality of validation provided by this agent ensemble in terms of the well-known software testing measure called mutation coverage.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6280\u672f\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u4f18\u5316\u5efa\u6a21\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7406\u751f\u6210\u6d4b\u8bd5API\u3001\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\u548c\u7279\u5b9a\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53d8\u5f02\uff0c\u4ee5\u9a8c\u8bc1LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u6b63\u786e\u6ee1\u8db3\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63cf\u8ff0\u7684\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63cf\u8ff0\u751f\u6210\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6d41\u884c\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u9a8c\u8bc1\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u6b63\u786e\u4e14\u6ee1\u8db3\u9700\u6c42\u6210\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u5f00\u653e\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e13\u95e8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6280\u672f\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u591a\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7406\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u751f\u6210\u95ee\u9898\u7ea7\u6d4b\u8bd5API\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u751f\u6210\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u751f\u6210\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u53d8\u5f02\uff08\u4e00\u79cd\u8bc4\u4f30\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5957\u4ef6\u6545\u969c\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6280\u672f\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u4ee3\u7406\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6307\u6807\uff08\u53d8\u5f02\u8986\u76d6\u7387\uff09\u65b9\u9762\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u5730\u5c06\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6280\u672f\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u4f18\u5316\u5efa\u6a21\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In particular, we draw an operational analogy to MVCC in databases and show why a direct transplant fails in a decoupled, multi-language setting. We then propose an agent-first design, Bauplan, that reimplements data and compute isolation in the lakehouse.

It integrates a reading-order modeling module based on layout flow, hierarchy-aware seg- mentation guided by table-of-contents anchors, and a multi- modal aggregation pipeline that contextually transforms vi- sual elements into coherent natural language. The framework further enriches its outputs with ESG, GRI, and sentiment labels, yielding annotations aligned with the analytical de- mands of financial research. Extensive experiments on anno- tated benchmarks demonstrate that Pharos-ESG consistently outperforms both dedicated document parsing systems and general-purpose multimodal models. In addition, we release Aurora-ESG, the first large-scale public dataset of ESG re- ports, spanning Mainland China, Hong Kong, and U.S. mar- kets, featuring unified structured representations of multi- modal content, enriched with fine-grained layout and seman- tic annotations to better support ESG integration in financial governance and decision-making.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Pharos-ESG\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06ESG\u62a5\u544a\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u89e3\u6790\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u53d9\u8ff0\u548c\u5c42\u6b21\u6807\u6ce8\u6765\u89e3\u51b3ESG\u62a5\u544a\u9605\u8bfb\u987a\u5e8f\u6df7\u4e71\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5f31\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "ESG\u62a5\u544a\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f01\u4e1aESG\u8868\u73b0\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u5a92\u4ecb\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u9605\u8bfb\u987a\u5e8f\u6df7\u4e71\u3001\u5e03\u5c40\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u3001\u5185\u5bb9\u5197\u957f\u4e14\u7ed3\u6784\u5f31\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u6574\u5408\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e03\u5c40\u6d41\u7684\u9605\u8bfb\u987a\u5e8f\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u76ee\u5f55\u951a\u70b9\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u611f\u77e5\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5c06\u89c6\u89c9\u5143\u7d20\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u8fde\u8d2f\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u805a\u5408\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u6ce8\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cPharos-ESG\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e13\u7528\u6587\u6863\u89e3\u6790\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u901a\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86Aurora-ESG\uff0c\u9996\u4e2a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u516c\u5f00ESG\u62a5\u544a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4e2d\u56fd\u5927\u9646\u3001\u9999\u6e2f\u548c\u7f8e\u56fd\u5e02\u573a\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5185\u5bb9\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u652f\u6301ESG\u5728\u91d1\u878d\u6cbb\u7406\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u7684\u6574\u5408\u3002"}}

Existing adaptation algorithms are typically trained iteratively, which incur significant communication costs and increase the susceptibility to potential attacks. Motivated by the one-shot federated training techniques that reduce client-server exchanges to a single round, developing a lightweight one-shot federated VLM adaptation method to alleviate these issues is particularly attractive. However, current one-shot approaches face certain challenges in adapting VLMs within federated settings: (1) insufficient exploitation of the rich multimodal information inherent in VLMs; (2) lack of specialized adaptation strategies to systematically handle the severe data heterogeneity; and (3) requiring additional training resource of clients or server. To bridge these gaps, we propose a novel Training-free One-shot Federated Adaptation framework for VLMs, named TOFA. To fully leverage the generalizable multimodal features in pre-trained VLMs, TOFA employs both visual and textual pipelines to extract task-relevant representations. In the visual pipeline, a hierarchical Bayesian model learns personalized, class-specific prototype distributions. For the textual pipeline, TOFA evaluates and globally aligns the generated local text prompts for robustness. An adaptive weight calibration mechanism is also introduced to combine predictions from both modalities, balancing personalization and robustness to handle data heterogeneity.

While caregivers may notice these changes informally, most computational tools are not designed to track such behavioral drift over time. This paper introduces PersonaDrift, a synthetic benchmark designed to evaluate machine learning and statistical methods for detecting progressive changes in daily communication, focusing on user responses to a digital reminder system. PersonaDrift simulates 60-day interaction logs for synthetic users modeled after real PLwD, based on interviews with caregivers. These caregiver-informed personas vary in tone, modality, and communication habits, enabling realistic diversity in behavior. The benchmark focuses on two forms of longitudinal change that caregivers highlighted as particularly salient: flattened sentiment (reduced emotional tone and verbosity) and off-topic replies (semantic drift). These changes are injected progressively at different rates to emulate naturalistic cognitive trajectories, and the framework is designed to be extensible to additional behaviors in future use cases. To explore this novel application space, we evaluate several anomaly detection approaches, unsupervised statistical methods (CUSUM, EWMA, One-Class SVM), sequence models using contextual embeddings (GRU + BERT), and supervised classifiers in both generalized and personalized settings. Preliminary results show that flattened sentiment can often be detected with simple statistical models in users with low baseline variability, while detecting semantic drift requires temporal modeling and personalized baselines. Across both tasks, personalized classifiers consistently outperform generalized ones, highlighting the importance of individual behavioral context.", "AI": {"tldr": "PersonaDrift\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u68c0\u6d4b\u75f4\u5446\u75c7\u60a3\u8005\u65e5\u5e38\u6c9f\u901a\u884c\u4e3a\u6e10\u8fdb\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u5408\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u6a21\u62df60\u5929\u4ea4\u4e92\u65e5\u5fd7\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u60c5\u611f\u6241\u5e73\u5316\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u6f02\u79fb\u4e24\u79cd\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u75f4\u5446\u75c7\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u6c9f\u901a\u884c\u4e3a\u4f1a\u9010\u6e10\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u8ba1\u7b97\u5de5\u5177\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u8ddf\u8e2a\u8fd9\u79cd\u6e10\u8fdb\u6027\u884c\u4e3a\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u62a4\u7406\u4eba\u5458\u8bbf\u8c08\u521b\u5efa\u5408\u6210\u7528\u6237\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6a21\u62df60\u5929\u4ea4\u4e92\u65e5\u5fd7\uff0c\u6ce8\u5165\u6e10\u8fdb\u6027\u53d8\u5316\uff08\u60c5\u611f\u6241\u5e73\u5316\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u6f02\u79fb\uff09\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u79cd\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\u7edf\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u76d1\u7763\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u60c5\u611f\u6241\u5e73\u5316\u5728\u4f4e\u57fa\u7ebf\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u7684\u7528\u6237\u4e2d\u53ef\u7528\u7b80\u5355\u7edf\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u800c\u8bed\u4e49\u6f02\u79fb\u9700\u8981\u65f6\u5e8f\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u57fa\u7ebf\uff1b\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5728\u6240\u6709\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u90fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u901a\u7528\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u75f4\u5446\u75c7\u60a3\u8005\u6c9f\u901a\u884c\u4e3a\u6e10\u8fdb\u53d8\u5316\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0cPersonaDrift\u4e3a\u8fd9\u4e00\u5e94\u7528\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Clinical notes, as unstructured documents rich with detailed patient observations, offer valuable context-specific insights and represent a promising yet underutilized source for ontology extension. Despite this potential, directly leveraging clinical notes for ontology extension remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we propose CLOZE, a novel framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to automatically extract medical entities from clinical notes and integrate them into hierarchical medical ontologies. By capitalizing on the strong language understanding and extensive biomedical knowledge of pre-trained LLMs, CLOZE effectively identifies disease-related concepts and captures complex hierarchical relationships.

Such models are able to explain each decision by pointing to the prototypes that contributed the most to the final outcome. As the explanation is a core part of the prediction, they are often qualified as ``interpretable by design\". While promising, we show that such explanations are sometimes misleading, which hampers their usefulness in safety-critical contexts. In particular, several instances may lead to different predictions and yet have the same explanation. Drawing inspiration from the field of formal eXplainable AI (FXAI), we propose Abductive Latent Explanations (ALEs), a formalism to express sufficient conditions on the intermediate (latent) representation of the instance that imply the prediction. Our approach combines the inherent interpretability of case-based reasoning models and the guarantees provided by formal XAI. We propose a solver-free and scalable algorithm for generating ALEs based on three distinct paradigms, compare them, and present the feasibility of our approach on diverse datasets for both standard and fine-grained image classification.

To bridge this research gap, we propose D-GARA, a dynamic benchmarking framework, to evaluate Android GUI agent robustness in real-world anomalies.

Comprehensive experiments and results demonstrate substantial performance degradation in state-of-the-art GUI agents when exposed to anomaly-rich environments, highlighting the need for robustness-aware learning.

However, existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off: adapting MLLMs to output a single score misaligns with the generative nature of MLLMs and limits fine-grained requirement understanding, whereas autoregressively generating judging analyses is prohibitively slow in high-throughput settings. Observing that judgment reduces to verifying whether inputs satisfy a set of structured requirements, we propose YOFO, a template-conditioned method that judges all requirements in a single forward pass. Built on an autoregressive model, YOFO accepts a structured requirement template and, in one inference step, produces a binary yes/no decision for each requirement by reading the logits of the final token associated with that requirement. This design yields orders-of-magnitude speedups while preserving interpretability. Extensive experiments show that YOFO not only achieves state-of-the-art results on standard recommendation datasets, but also supports dependency-aware analysis-where subsequent judgments are conditioned on previous ones-and further benefits from post-hoc CoT.", "AI": {"tldr": "YOFO\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u677f\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u5224\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u6b21\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u540c\u65f6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u591a\u4e2a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709MLLM\u8bc4\u5224\u65b9\u6cd5\u9762\u4e34\u57fa\u672c\u6743\u8861\uff1a\u8f93\u51fa\u5355\u4e00\u5206\u6570\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u6027\u8d28\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u4e14\u9650\u5236\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8981\u6c42\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u800c\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u751f\u6210\u8bc4\u5224\u5206\u6790\u5728\u9ad8\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u901f\u5ea6\u8fc7\u6162\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u6784\u5efaYOFO\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63a5\u53d7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8981\u6c42\u6a21\u677f\uff0c\u5728\u5355\u6b21\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u8bfb\u53d6\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8981\u6c42\u76f8\u5173\u6700\u7ec8token\u7684logits\uff0c\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8981\u6c42\u751f\u6210\u4e8c\u5143\u662f/\u5426\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u63a8\u8350\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4f9d\u8d56\u611f\u77e5\u5206\u6790\uff08\u540e\u7eed\u5224\u65ad\u57fa\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u5224\u65ad\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u4ece\u540e\u9a8c\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u4e2d\u83b7\u76ca\u3002", "conclusion": "YOFO\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5728\u5b9e\u73b0\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u52a0\u901f\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86MLLM\u8bc4\u5224\u4e2d\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7406\u89e3\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

To address these limitations, we introduce Deliberate Practice Policy Optimization (DPPO), a metacognitive ``Metaloop'' training framework that dynamically alternates between supervised fine-tuning (competence expansion) and reinforcement learning (skill refinement). This enables automatic weakness identification and targeted resource allocation, specifically designed to maximize learning efficiency from sparse, finite data. Theoretically, DPPO can be formalised as a unified preference-learning framework. Empirically, training a vision-language embodied model with DPPO, referred to as Pelican-VL 1.0, yields a 20.3% performance improvement over the base model and surpasses open-source models at the 100B-parameter scale by 10.6%.

Although transformers show strong potential for clinical decision support, they remain prone to overconfidence, especially in ambiguous medical cases where calibrated uncertainty is critical. MedBayes-Lite embeds uncertainty quantification directly into existing transformer pipelines without any retraining or architectural rewiring, adding no new trainable layers and keeping parameter overhead under 3 percent. The framework integrates three components: (i) Bayesian Embedding Calibration using Monte Carlo dropout for epistemic uncertainty, (ii) Uncertainty-Weighted Attention that marginalizes over token reliability, and (iii) Confidence-Guided Decision Shaping inspired by clinical risk minimization. Across biomedical QA and clinical prediction benchmarks (MedQA, PubMedQA, MIMIC-III), MedBayes-Lite consistently improves calibration and trustworthiness, reducing overconfidence by 32 to 48 percent. In simulated clinical settings, it can prevent up to 41 percent of diagnostic errors by flagging uncertain predictions for human review.

We synthesize cognitive science research into a taxonomy of 28 cognitive elements spanning computational constraints, meta-cognitive controls, knowledge representations, and transformation operations, then analyze their behavioral manifestations in reasoning traces. We propose a fine-grained cognitive evaluation framework and conduct the first large-scale analysis of 170K traces from 17 models across text, vision, and audio modalities, alongside 54 human think-aloud traces, which we make publicly available. Our analysis reveals systematic structural differences: humans employ hierarchical nesting and meta-cognitive monitoring while models rely on shallow forward chaining, with divergence most pronounced on ill-structured problems. Meta-analysis of 1,598 LLM reasoning papers reveals the research community concentrates on easily quantifiable behaviors (sequential organization: 55%, decomposition: 60%) while neglecting meta-cognitive controls (self-awareness: 16%, evaluation: 8%) that correlate with success. Models possess behavioral repertoires associated with success but fail to deploy them spontaneously. Leveraging these patterns, we develop test-time reasoning guidance that automatically scaffold successful structures, improving performance by up to 60% on complex problems. By bridging cognitive science and LLM research, we establish a foundation for developing models that reason through principled cognitive mechanisms rather than brittle spurious reasoning shortcuts or memorization, opening new directions for both improving model capabilities and testing theories of human cognition at scale.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b28\u4e2a\u8ba4\u77e5\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e8617\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u768417\u4e07\u6761\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4eba\u7c7b\u4f7f\u7528\u5c42\u6b21\u5d4c\u5957\u548c\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u76d1\u63a7\uff0c\u800c\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u6d45\u5c42\u524d\u5411\u94fe\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5143\u5206\u6790\u53d1\u73b0\u7814\u7a76\u793e\u533a\u5173\u6ce8\u6613\u91cf\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\u800c\u5ffd\u89c6\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u63a7\u5236\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u5f0f\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u63a8\u7406\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u5c06\u590d\u6742\u95ee\u9898\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe60%\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u95ee\u9898\u4f46\u5728\u7b80\u5355\u53d8\u4f53\u4e0a\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u63a8\u7406\u6839\u672c\u4e0d\u540c\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba4\u77e5\u79d1\u5b66\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8e\u539f\u5219\u6027\u8ba4\u77e5\u673a\u5236\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "method": "\u7efc\u5408\u8ba4\u77e5\u79d1\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u6784\u5efa28\u4e2a\u8ba4\u77e5\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u679017\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u768417\u4e07\u6761\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c54\u6761\u4eba\u7c7b\u51fa\u58f0\u601d\u7ef4\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u884c\u4e3a\u5206\u6790\u3002\u5bf91,598\u7bc7LLM\u63a8\u7406\u8bba\u6587\u8fdb\u884c\u5143\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u63a8\u7406\u6307\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4eba\u7c7b\u4f7f\u7528\u5c42\u6b21\u5d4c\u5957\u548c\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u76d1\u63a7\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u6d45\u5c42\u524d\u5411\u94fe\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5728\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u5dee\u5f02\u6700\u660e\u663e\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u793e\u533a\u5173\u6ce8\u987a\u5e8f\u7ec4\u7ec7(55%)\u548c\u5206\u89e3(60%)\u7b49\u6613\u91cf\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u800c\u5ffd\u89c6\u81ea\u6211\u610f\u8bc6(16%)\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30(8%)\u7b49\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u63a7\u5236\u3002\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u63a8\u7406\u6307\u5bfc\u53ef\u5c06\u590d\u6742\u95ee\u9898\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe60%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6865\u63a5\u8ba4\u77e5\u79d1\u5b66\u548cLLM\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8e\u539f\u5219\u6027\u8ba4\u77e5\u673a\u5236\u800c\u975e\u8106\u5f31\u4f2a\u63a8\u7406\u6377\u5f84\u6216\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u4e3a\u6539\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u7406\u8bba\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Recent advances in reproducible and verifiable execution allow jobs to pause, verify, and resume across heterogeneous hardware, which allow us to treat compute as time indexed capacity rather than bespoke bundles. We design an automated market maker (AMM) that posts an hourly price as a concave function of load--the ratio of current demand to a \"floor supply\" (providers willing to work at a preset floor). This mechanism decouples price discovery from allocation and yields transparent, low latency trading. We establish existence and uniqueness of equilibrium quotes and give conditions under which the equilibrium is admissible (i.e. active supply weakly exceeds demand). To align incentives, we pair a premium sharing pool (base cost plus a pro rata share of contemporaneous surplus) with a Cheapest Feasible Matching (CFM) rule; under mild assumptions, providers optimally stake early and fully while truthfully report costs. Despite being simple and computationally efficient, we show that CFM attains bounded worst case regret relative to an optimal benchmark.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u505a\u5e02\u5546\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d1f\u8f7d\u7684\u5b9a\u4ef7\u673a\u5236\u548c\u6700\u4f18\u5339\u914d\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u900f\u660e\u7684\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u4ea4\u6613\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u53ef\u590d\u5236\u548c\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6267\u884c\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u53ef\u4ee5\u50cf\u65f6\u95f4\u7d22\u5f15\u5bb9\u91cf\u4e00\u6837\u4ea4\u6613\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u4e2a\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u5e02\u573a\u6765\u5904\u7406\u8fd9\u79cd\u6613\u901d\u6027\u5546\u54c1\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d1f\u8f7d\u7684\u5b9a\u4ef7AMM\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6ea2\u4ef7\u5171\u4eab\u6c60\u548c\u6700\u4f4e\u53ef\u884c\u5339\u914d\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ef7\u683c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0e\u5206\u914d\u7684\u89e3\u8026\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5747\u8861\u62a5\u4ef7\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u548c\u552f\u4e00\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u6e29\u548c\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u662f\u65e9\u671f\u5168\u989d\u8d28\u62bc\u5e76\u771f\u5b9e\u62a5\u544a\u6210\u672c\uff0cCFM\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6700\u4f18\u57fa\u51c6\u5177\u6709\u6709\u754c\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u9057\u61be\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u673a\u5236\u7b80\u5355\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u900f\u660e\u7684\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4ea4\u6613\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6709\u6548\u6fc0\u52b1\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\u53c2\u4e0e\u5e02\u573a\u3002"}}
