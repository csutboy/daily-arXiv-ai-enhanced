To address this gap, we develop an LLM-based prevention-behavior simulation framework that couples (i) a static module for behavior-intensity prediction under a specified external context and (ii) a dynamic module that updates residents' perceived risk over time and propagates these updates into behavior evolution. The model is implemented via structured prompt engineering in a first-person perspective and is evaluated against two rounds of survey data from Beijing residents (R1: December 2020; R2: August 2021) under progressively realistic data-availability settings: zero-shot, few-shot, and cross-context transfer. Using Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests to compare simulated and observed behavior distributions (p > 0.001 as the validity criterion), the framework demonstrates robust performance and improves with limited reference examples; reported predictive accuracy increases from 72.7% (zero-shot) to 81.8% (few-shot), and remains high at 77.8% under transfer to novel contexts. We further apply the framework to simulate behavior changes during China's December 2022 policy relaxation and to stress-test behavioral responses across 120 systematically varied epidemic conditions (R0, CFR, and control-measure tiers). Results indicate broad behavioral loosening under relaxation but a distinctive counter-trend increase in drain-related disinfection, highlighting how low-cost, low-friction behaviors may persist or intensify even when external constraints recede-raising a potential environmental tradeoff."}

Factors that affect how one arrives at an opinion reflect how they have been shaped by their environment throughout their lives, education, material status, what belief systems are they subscribed to, and what socio-economic minorities are they a part of. This already complex system is further expanded by the ever-changing nature of one's social network. It is therefore no surprise that many models have a tendency to perform best for the majority of the population and discriminating those people who are members of various marginalized groups . This bias and the study of how to counter it are subject to a rapidly developing field of Fairness in Social Network Analysis (SNA). The focus of this work is to look into how a state-of-the-art model discriminates certain minority groups and whether it is possible to reliably predict for whom it will perform worse. Moreover, is such prediction possible based solely on one's demographic or topological features? To this end, the NetSense dataset, together with a state-of-the-art CoDiNG model for opinion prediction have been employed. Our work explores how three classifier models (Demography-Based, Topology-Based, and Hybrid) perform when assessing for whom this algorithm will provide inaccurate predictions. Finally, through a comprehensive analysis of these experimental results, we identify four key patterns of algorithmic bias. Our findings suggest that no single paradigm provides the best results and that there is a real need for context-aware strategies in fairness-oriented social network analysis. We conclude that a multi-faceted approach, incorporating both individual attributes and network structures, is essential for reducing algorithmic bias and promoting inclusive decision-making."}

We work out finite sample minimax regret treatment rules under various sampling schemes when outcomes are restricted onto the unit interval. In contrast to Stoye (2009) where the focus is on maximization of expected utility the focus here is instead on a particular quantile of the outcome distribution. We find that in the case where the sample consists of a fixed number of untreated and a fixed number of treated units, any treatment rule is minimax regret optimal. The same is true in the case of random treatment assignment in the sample with any assignment probability and in the case of testing an innovation when the known quantile of the untreated population equals 1/2. However if the known quantile exceeds 1/2 then never treating is the unique optimal rule and if it is smaller than 1/2 always treating is optimal. We also consider the case where a covariate is included."}

A Generated Panel Approach", "comment": null, "summary": "Students from different socioeconomic backgrounds exhibit persistent gaps in test scores, gaps that can translate into unequal educational and labor-market outcomes later in life. In many assessments, performance reflects not only what students know, but also how effectively they can communicate that knowledge. This distinction is especially salient in writing assessments, where scores jointly reward the substance of students' ideas and the way those ideas are expressed. As a result, observed score gaps may conflate differences in underlying content with differences in expressive skill. A central question, therefore, is how much of the socioeconomic-status (SES) gap in scores is driven by differences in what students say versus how they say it. We study this question using a large corpus of persuasive essays written by U.S. middle- and high-school students. We introduce a new measurement strategy that separates content from style by leveraging large language models to generate multiple stylistic variants of each essay. These rewrites preserve the underlying arguments while systematically altering surface expression, creating a \"generated panel\" that introduces controlled within-essay variation in style. This approach allows us to decompose SES gaps in writing scores into contributions from content and style. We find an SES gap of 0.67 points on a 1-6 scale. Approximately 69% of the gap is attributable to differences in essay content quality, Style differences account for 26% of the gap, and differences in evaluation standards across SES groups account for the remaining 5%. These patterns seems stable across demographic subgroups and writing tasks. More broadly, our approach shows how large language models can be used to generate controlled variation in observational data, enabling researchers to isolate and quantify the contributions of otherwise entangled factors."}

However, whether LFMs can provide truly personalized treatment recommendations remains an open question. Recent research has revealed multiple challenges for personalization, including the fundamental generalizability paradox: models achieving high accuracy in one clinical study perform at chance level in others, demonstrating that personalization and external validity exist in tension. This exemplifies broader contradictions in AI-driven healthcare: the privacy-performance paradox, scale-specificity paradox, and the automation-empathy paradox. As another challenge, the degree of causal understanding required for personalized recommendations, as opposed to mere predictive capacities of LFMs, remains an open question. N-of-1 trials -- crossover self-experiments and the gold standard for individual causal inference in personalized medicine -- resolve these tensions by providing within-person causal evidence while preserving privacy through local experimentation. Despite their impressive capabilities, this paper argues that LFMs cannot replace N-of-1 trials. We argue that LFMs and N-of-1 trials are complementary: LFMs excel at rapid hypothesis generation from population patterns using multimodal data, while N-of-1 trials excel at causal validation for a given individual. We propose a hybrid framework that combines the strengths of both to enable personalization and navigate the identified paradoxes: LFMs generate ranked intervention candidates with uncertainty estimates, which trigger subsequent N-of-1 trials. Clarifying the boundary between prediction and causation and explicitly addressing the paradoxical tensions are essential for responsible AI integration in personalized medicine."}

Beyond Information Processing Toward Mastery", "comment": "accepted at IEEE EDUCON 2026", "summary": "Engineering education faces a double disruption: traditional apprenticeship models that cultivated judgment and tacit skill are eroding, just as generative AI emerges as an informal coaching partner. This convergence rekindles long-standing questions in the philosophy of AI and cognition about the limits of computation, the nature of embodied rationality, and the distinction between information processing and wisdom. Building on this rich intellectual tradition, this paper examines whether AI chatbots can provide coaching that fosters mastery rather than merely delivering information. We synthesize critical perspectives from decades of scholarship on expertise, tacit knowledge, and human-machine interaction, situating them within the context of contemporary AI-driven education. Empirically, we report findings from a mixed-methods study (N = 75 students, N = 7 faculty) exploring the use of a coaching chatbot in engineering education. Results reveal a consistent boundary: participants accept AI for technical problem solving (convergent tasks; M = 3.84 on a 1-5 Likert scale) but remain skeptical of its capacity for moral, emotional, and contextual judgment (divergent tasks). Faculty express stronger concerns over risk (M = 4.71 vs. M = 4.14, p = 0.003), and privacy emerges as a key requirement, with 64-71 percent of participants demanding strict confidentiality. Our findings suggest that while generative AI can democratize access to cognitive and procedural support, it cannot replicate the embodied, value-laden dimensions of human mentorship. We propose a multiplex coaching framework that integrates human wisdom within expert-in-the-loop models, preserving the depth of apprenticeship while leveraging AI scalability to enrich the next generation of engineering education."}

A joint macro-financial scenario vector, augmented with an explicit geopolitical risk factor, is mapped into stressed probabilities of default and losses given default. These stresses are then propagated to portfolio tail losses through a latent factor structure and translated into a stressed CET1 ratio, jointly accounting for capital depletion and risk-weighted asset dynamics. Reverse stress testing is formulated as a constrained maximum likelihood problem over the scenario space. This yields a geopolitical point reverse stress test, or design point, defined as the most probable scenario that breaches a prescribed capital adequacy constraint under a reference distribution. The framework further characterises neighbourhoods and near optimal sets of reverse stress scenarios, allowing for sensitivity analysis and governance oriented interpretation. The approach is compatible with internal rating based models and supports implementation at the exposure or sector level."}

To maintain relevance, the Act embeds provisions for regulatory learning. However, these provisions operate within a complex network of actors and mechanisms that lack a clearly defined technical basis for scalable information flow. This paper addresses this gap by establishing a theoretical model of regulatory learning space defined by the AI Act, decomposed into micro, meso, and macro levels. Drawing from this functional perspective of this model, we situate the diverse stakeholders - ranging from the EU Commission at the macro level to AI developers at the micro level - within the transitions of enforcement (macro-micro) and evidence aggregation (micro-macro). We identify AI Technical Sandboxes as the essential engine for evidence generation at the micro level, providing the necessary data to drive scalable learning across all levels of the model. By providing an extensive discussion of the requirements and challenges for AITSes to serve as this micro-level evidence generator, we aim to bridge the gap between legislative commands and technical operationalisation, thereby enabling a structured discourse between technical and legal experts."}

In this paper, we compare the finite $N$ mean square errors (MSEs) of PC and KF factors extracted under different structures of the idiosyncratic cross-correlations. We show that the MSEs of PC-based factors, implicitly based on treating the true underlying factors as deterministic, are larger than the corresponding MSEs of KF factors, obtained by treating the true factors as either serially independent or autocorrelated random variables. We also study and compare the MSEs of PC and KF factors estimated when the idiosyncratic components are wrongly considered as if they were cross-sectionally homoscedastic and/or uncorrelated.

This paper argues that this fragmentation cannot be explained solely by geopolitical rivalry, institutional complexity, or instrument selection. Instead, it stems from how AI is constituted as an object of governance through distinct institutional logics. Integrating securitisation theory with the concept of the dispositif, we demonstrate that jurisdictions govern ontologically different objects under the same vocabulary. Using semantic network analysis of official policy texts from the European Union, the United States, and China (2023-2025), we trace how concepts like safety are embedded within divergent semantic architectures. Our findings reveal that the EU juridifies AI as a certifiable product through legal-bureaucratic logic; the US operationalises AI as an optimisable system through market-liberal logic; and China governs AI as socio-technical infrastructure through holistic state logic. We introduce the concept of structural incommensurability to describe this condition of ontological divergence masked by terminological convergence. This reframing challenges ethics-by-principles approaches to global AI governance, suggesting that coordination failures arise not from disagreement over values but from the absence of a shared reference object."}

In this paper, we aim to fill this gap by exploring how legal rules, principles, and methods can be leveraged to address problems of alignment and inform the design of AI systems that operate safely and ethically. This emerging field -- legal alignment -- focuses on three research directions: (1) designing AI systems to comply with the content of legal rules developed through legitimate institutions and processes, (2) adapting methods from legal interpretation to guide how AI systems reason and make decisions, and (3) harnessing legal concepts as a structural blueprint for confronting challenges of reliability, trust, and cooperation in AI systems. These research directions present new conceptual, empirical, and institutional questions, which include examining the specific set of laws that particular AI systems should follow, creating evaluations to assess their legal compliance in real-world settings, and developing governance frameworks to support the implementation of legal alignment in practice. Tackling these questions requires expertise across law, computer science, and other disciplines, offering these communities the opportunity to collaborate in designing AI for the better."}

A Generated Panel Approach", "comment": null, "summary": "Students from different socioeconomic backgrounds exhibit persistent gaps in test scores, gaps that can translate into unequal educational and labor-market outcomes later in life. In many assessments, performance reflects not only what students know, but also how effectively they can communicate that knowledge. This distinction is especially salient in writing assessments, where scores jointly reward the substance of students' ideas and the way those ideas are expressed. As a result, observed score gaps may conflate differences in underlying content with differences in expressive skill. A central question, therefore, is how much of the socioeconomic-status (SES) gap in scores is driven by differences in what students say versus how they say it. We study this question using a large corpus of persuasive essays written by U.S. middle- and high-school students. We introduce a new measurement strategy that separates content from style by leveraging large language models to generate multiple stylistic variants of each essay. These rewrites preserve the underlying arguments while systematically altering surface expression, creating a \"generated panel\" that introduces controlled within-essay variation in style. This approach allows us to decompose SES gaps in writing scores into contributions from content and style. We find an SES gap of 0.67 points on a 1-6 scale. Approximately 69% of the gap is attributable to differences in essay content quality, Style differences account for 26% of the gap, and differences in evaluation standards across SES groups account for the remaining 5%. These patterns seems stable across demographic subgroups and writing tasks. More broadly, our approach shows how large language models can be used to generate controlled variation in observational data, enabling researchers to isolate and quantify the contributions of otherwise entangled factors."}

Factors that affect how one arrives at an opinion reflect how they have been shaped by their environment throughout their lives, education, material status, what belief systems are they subscribed to, and what socio-economic minorities are they a part of. This already complex system is further expanded by the ever-changing nature of one's social network. It is therefore no surprise that many models have a tendency to perform best for the majority of the population and discriminating those people who are members of various marginalized groups . This bias and the study of how to counter it are subject to a rapidly developing field of Fairness in Social Network Analysis (SNA). The focus of this work is to look into how a state-of-the-art model discriminates certain minority groups and whether it is possible to reliably predict for whom it will perform worse. Moreover, is such prediction possible based solely on one's demographic or topological features? To this end, the NetSense dataset, together with a state-of-the-art CoDiNG model for opinion prediction have been employed. Our work explores how three classifier models (Demography-Based, Topology-Based, and Hybrid) perform when assessing for whom this algorithm will provide inaccurate predictions. Finally, through a comprehensive analysis of these experimental results, we identify four key patterns of algorithmic bias. Our findings suggest that no single paradigm provides the best results and that there is a real need for context-aware strategies in fairness-oriented social network analysis. We conclude that a multi-faceted approach, incorporating both individual attributes and network structures, is essential for reducing algorithmic bias and promoting inclusive decision-making."}

Unfortunately, the tractability of computing such a variance is hardly known. Motivated by this, we consider the problem of computing the variance of WMC and investigate this problem's tractability. First, we derive a polynomial time algorithm to evaluate the WMC variance when the input is given as a structured d-DNNF. Second, we prove the hardness of this problem for structured DNNFs, d-DNNFs, and FBDDs, which is intriguing because the latter two allow polynomial time WMC algorithms. Finally, we show an application that measures the uncertainty in the inference of Bayesian networks. We empirically show that our algorithm can evaluate the variance of the marginal probability on real-world Bayesian networks and analyze the impact of the variances of parameters on the variance of the marginal."}

Recent research has attempted to improve safety by training models to reason over safety rules before responding. However, a key issue lies in determining what form of safety reasoning effectively defends against jailbreak attacks, which is difficult to explicitly design or directly obtain. To address this, we propose \\textbf{STAR-S} (\\textbf{S}elf-\\textbf{TA}ught \\textbf{R}easoning based on \\textbf{S}afety rules), a framework that integrates the learning of safety rule reasoning into a self-taught loop. The core of STAR-S involves eliciting reasoning and reflection guided by safety rules, then leveraging fine-tuning to enhance safety reasoning. Repeating this process creates a synergistic cycle. Improvements in the model's reasoning and interpretation of safety rules allow it to produce better reasoning data under safety rule prompts, which is then utilized for further training. Experiments show that STAR-S effectively defends against jailbreak attacks, outperforming baselines. Code is available at: https://github.com/pikepokenew/STAR_S.git."}

To address this gap, we develop an LLM-based prevention-behavior simulation framework that couples (i) a static module for behavior-intensity prediction under a specified external context and (ii) a dynamic module that updates residents' perceived risk over time and propagates these updates into behavior evolution. The model is implemented via structured prompt engineering in a first-person perspective and is evaluated against two rounds of survey data from Beijing residents (R1: December 2020; R2: August 2021) under progressively realistic data-availability settings: zero-shot, few-shot, and cross-context transfer. Using Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests to compare simulated and observed behavior distributions (p > 0.001 as the validity criterion), the framework demonstrates robust performance and improves with limited reference examples; reported predictive accuracy increases from 72.7% (zero-shot) to 81.8% (few-shot), and remains high at 77.8% under transfer to novel contexts. We further apply the framework to simulate behavior changes during China's December 2022 policy relaxation and to stress-test behavioral responses across 120 systematically varied epidemic conditions (R0, CFR, and control-measure tiers).

Beyond Information Processing Toward Mastery", "comment": "accepted at IEEE EDUCON 2026", "summary": "Engineering education faces a double disruption: traditional apprenticeship models that cultivated judgment and tacit skill are eroding, just as generative AI emerges as an informal coaching partner. This convergence rekindles long-standing questions in the philosophy of AI and cognition about the limits of computation, the nature of embodied rationality, and the distinction between information processing and wisdom. Building on this rich intellectual tradition, this paper examines whether AI chatbots can provide coaching that fosters mastery rather than merely delivering information. We synthesize critical perspectives from decades of scholarship on expertise, tacit knowledge, and human-machine interaction, situating them within the context of contemporary AI-driven education. Empirically, we report findings from a mixed-methods study (N = 75 students, N = 7 faculty) exploring the use of a coaching chatbot in engineering education. Results reveal a consistent boundary: participants accept AI for technical problem solving (convergent tasks; M = 3.84 on a 1-5 Likert scale) but remain skeptical of its capacity for moral, emotional, and contextual judgment (divergent tasks). Faculty express stronger concerns over risk (M = 4.71 vs. M = 4.14, p = 0.003), and privacy emerges as a key requirement, with 64-71 percent of participants demanding strict confidentiality. Our findings suggest that while generative AI can democratize access to cognitive and procedural support, it cannot replicate the embodied, value-laden dimensions of human mentorship. We propose a multiplex coaching framework that integrates human wisdom within expert-in-the-loop models, preserving the depth of apprenticeship while leveraging AI scalability to enrich the next generation of engineering education."}

Generative world models offer a promising remedy: agents could use them as external simulators to foresee outcomes before acting. This paper empirically examines whether current agents can leverage such world models as tools to enhance their cognition. Across diverse agentic and visual question answering tasks, we observe that some agents rarely invoke simulation (fewer than 1%), frequently misuse predicted rollouts (approximately 15%), and often exhibit inconsistent or even degraded performance (up to 5%) when simulation is available or enforced. Attribution analysis further indicates that the primary bottleneck lies in the agents' capacity to decide when to simulate, how to interpret predicted outcomes, and how to integrate foresight into downstream reasoning. These findings underscore the need for mechanisms that foster calibrated, strategic interaction with world models, paving the way toward more reliable anticipatory cognition in future agent systems."}

However, extending this paradigm to financial decision is challenged by the market's stochastic nature: rewards are verifiable but inherently noisy, causing standard RL to degenerate into reward hacking. To address this, we propose Trade-R1, a model training framework that bridges verifiable rewards to stochastic environments via process-level reasoning verification. Our key innovation is a verification method that transforms the problem of evaluating reasoning over lengthy financial documents into a structured Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) task. We construct a triangular consistency metric, assessing pairwise alignment between retrieved evidence, reasoning chains, and decisions to serve as a validity filter for noisy market returns. We explore two reward integration strategies: Fixed-effect Semantic Reward (FSR) for stable alignment signals, and Dynamic-effect Semantic Reward (DSR) for coupled magnitude optimization. Experiments on different country asset selection demonstrate that our paradigm reduces reward hacking, with DSR achieving superior cross-market generalization while maintaining the highest reasoning consistency."}

However, this paradigm incurs substantial deployment costs as models often exhibit excessive verbosity on simple queries. Existing efficient reasoning methods relying on explicit length penalties often introduce optimization conflicts and leave the generative mechanisms driving overthinking largely unexamined. In this paper, we identify a phenomenon termed length shift where models increasingly generate unnecessary reasoning on trivial inputs during training. To address this, we introduce Dynamic Outlier Truncation (DOT), a training-time intervention that selectively suppresses redundant tokens. This method targets only the extreme tail of response lengths within fully correct rollout groups while preserving long-horizon reasoning capabilities for complex problems. To complement this intervention and ensure stable convergence, we further incorporate auxiliary KL regularization and predictive dynamic sampling. Experimental results across multiple model scales demonstrate that our approach significantly pushes the efficiency-performance Pareto frontier outward. Notably, on the AIME-24, our method reduces inference token usage by 78% while simultaneously increasing accuracy compared to the initial policy and surpassing state-of-the-art efficient reasoning methods."}

This is challenging because the model must predict post-action states with spatial awareness while remaining efficient enough for practical deployment. In this paper, we propose MobileDreamer, an efficient world-model-based lookahead framework to equip the GUI agents based on the future imagination provided by the world model.

We present a comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding drift phenomena, proposing three distinct manifestations: semantic drift (progressive deviation from original intent), coordination drift (breakdown in multi-agent consensus mechanisms), and behavioral drift (emergence of unintended strategies).\n  We introduce the Agent Stability Index (ASI), a novel composite metric framework for quantifying drift across twelve dimensions, including response consistency, tool usage patterns, reasoning pathway stability, and inter-agent agreement rates.

Factors that affect how one arrives at an opinion reflect how they have been shaped by their environment throughout their lives, education, material status, what belief systems are they subscribed to, and what socio-economic minorities are they a part of. This already complex system is further expanded by the ever-changing nature of one's social network. It is therefore no surprise that many models have a tendency to perform best for the majority of the population and discriminating those people who are members of various marginalized groups . This bias and the study of how to counter it are subject to a rapidly developing field of Fairness in Social Network Analysis (SNA). The focus of this work is to look into how a state-of-the-art model discriminates certain minority groups and whether it is possible to reliably predict for whom it will perform worse. Moreover, is such prediction possible based solely on one's demographic or topological features? To this end, the NetSense dataset, together with a state-of-the-art CoDiNG model for opinion prediction have been employed. Our work explores how three classifier models (Demography-Based, Topology-Based, and Hybrid) perform when assessing for whom this algorithm will provide inaccurate predictions. Finally, through a comprehensive analysis of these experimental results, we identify four key patterns of algorithmic bias.

Generative world models offer a promising remedy: agents could use them as external simulators to foresee outcomes before acting. This paper empirically examines whether current agents can leverage such world models as tools to enhance their cognition. Across diverse agentic and visual question answering tasks, we observe that some agents rarely invoke simulation (fewer than 1%), frequently misuse predicted rollouts (approximately 15%), and often exhibit inconsistent or even degraded performance (up to 5%) when simulation is available or enforced. Attribution analysis further indicates that the primary bottleneck lies in the agents' capacity to decide when to simulate, how to interpret predicted outcomes, and how to integrate foresight into downstream reasoning. These findings underscore the need for mechanisms that foster calibrated, strategic interaction with world models, paving the way toward more reliable anticipatory cognition in future agent systems."}

However, extending this paradigm to financial decision is challenged by the market's stochastic nature: rewards are verifiable but inherently noisy, causing standard RL to degenerate into reward hacking. To address this, we propose Trade-R1, a model training framework that bridges verifiable rewards to stochastic environments via process-level reasoning verification. Our key innovation is a verification method that transforms the problem of evaluating reasoning over lengthy financial documents into a structured Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) task. We construct a triangular consistency metric, assessing pairwise alignment between retrieved evidence, reasoning chains, and decisions to serve as a validity filter for noisy market returns. We explore two reward integration strategies: Fixed-effect Semantic Reward (FSR) for stable alignment signals, and Dynamic-effect Semantic Reward (DSR) for coupled magnitude optimization. Experiments on different country asset selection demonstrate that our paradigm reduces reward hacking, with DSR achieving superior cross-market generalization while maintaining the highest reasoning consistency."}

Beyond Information Processing Toward Mastery", "comment": "accepted at IEEE EDUCON 2026", "summary": "Engineering education faces a double disruption: traditional apprenticeship models that cultivated judgment and tacit skill are eroding, just as generative AI emerges as an informal coaching partner. This convergence rekindles long-standing questions in the philosophy of AI and cognition about the limits of computation, the nature of embodied rationality, and the distinction between information processing and wisdom. Building on this rich intellectual tradition, this paper examines whether AI chatbots can provide coaching that fosters mastery rather than merely delivering information. We synthesize critical perspectives from decades of scholarship on expertise, tacit knowledge, and human-machine interaction, situating them within the context of contemporary AI-driven education. Empirically, we report findings from a mixed-methods study (N = 75 students, N = 7 faculty) exploring the use of a coaching chatbot in engineering education. Results reveal a consistent boundary: participants accept AI for technical problem solving (convergent tasks; M = 3.84 on a 1-5 Likert scale) but remain skeptical of its capacity for moral, emotional, and contextual judgment (divergent tasks). Faculty express stronger concerns over risk (M = 4.71 vs. M = 4.14, p = 0.003), and privacy emerges as a key requirement, with 64-71 percent of participants demanding strict confidentiality. Our findings suggest that while generative AI can democratize access to cognitive and procedural support, it cannot replicate the embodied, value-laden dimensions of human mentorship. We propose a multiplex coaching framework that integrates human wisdom within expert-in-the-loop models, preserving the depth of apprenticeship while leveraging AI scalability to enrich the next generation of engineering education."}

However, this paradigm incurs substantial deployment costs as models often exhibit excessive verbosity on simple queries. Existing efficient reasoning methods relying on explicit length penalties often introduce optimization conflicts and leave the generative mechanisms driving overthinking largely unexamined. In this paper, we identify a phenomenon termed length shift where models increasingly generate unnecessary reasoning on trivial inputs during training. To address this, we introduce Dynamic Outlier Truncation (DOT), a training-time intervention that selectively suppresses redundant tokens. This method targets only the extreme tail of response lengths within fully correct rollout groups while preserving long-horizon reasoning capabilities for complex problems. To complement this intervention and ensure stable convergence, we further incorporate auxiliary KL regularization and predictive dynamic sampling. Experimental results across multiple model scales demonstrate that our approach significantly pushes the efficiency-performance Pareto frontier outward. Notably, on the AIME-24, our method reduces inference token usage by 78% while simultaneously increasing accuracy compared to the initial policy and surpassing state-of-the-art efficient reasoning methods."}

In this work, we propose a decentralized Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agent to address the selection of computing locations. Unlike most existing work, we analyze it in a real testbed composed of various edge devices running the agent to determine where to execute each task. These devices are connected to a Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) server and a Cloud server through 5G communications. We evaluate not only the agent's performance in meeting task requirements but also the implications of running this type of agent locally, assessing the trade-offs of training locally versus remotely in terms of latency and energy consumption."}

We found that generating CSAM with GenAI may have criminal and legal consequences not only for the user committing the primary offense but also for individuals responsible for the models, such as independent software developers, researchers, and company representatives. Additionally, the assessment of criminal liability may be affected by contextual and technical factors, including the type of generated image, content moderation policies, and the model's intended purpose.

However, most existing agents remain reactive, making decisions mainly from current screen, which limits their performance on long-horizon tasks. Building a world model from repeated interactions enables forecasting action outcomes and supports better decision making for mobile GUI agents. This is challenging because the model must predict post-action states with spatial awareness while remaining efficient enough for practical deployment. In this paper, we propose MobileDreamer, an efficient world-model-based lookahead framework to equip the GUI agents based on the future imagination provided by the world model. It consists of textual sketch world model and rollout imagination for GUI agent. Textual sketch world model forecasts post-action states through a learning process to transform digital images into key task-related sketches, and designs a novel order-invariant learning strategy to preserve the spatial information of GUI elements. The rollout imagination strategy for GUI agent optimizes the action-selection process by leveraging the prediction capability of world model. Experiments on Android World show that MobileDreamer achieves state-of-the-art performance and improves task success by 5.25%. World model evaluations further verify that our textual sketch modeling accurately forecasts key GUI elements."}

To maintain relevance, the Act embeds provisions for regulatory learning. However, these provisions operate within a complex network of actors and mechanisms that lack a clearly defined technical basis for scalable information flow. This paper addresses this gap by establishing a theoretical model of regulatory learning space defined by the AI Act, decomposed into micro, meso, and macro levels. Drawing from this functional perspective of this model, we situate the diverse stakeholders - ranging from the EU Commission at the macro level to AI developers at the micro level - within the transitions of enforcement (macro-micro) and evidence aggregation (micro-macro). We identify AI Technical Sandboxes as the essential engine for evidence generation at the micro level, providing the necessary data to drive scalable learning across all levels of the model. By providing an extensive discussion of the requirements and challenges for AITSes to serve as this micro-level evidence generator, we aim to bridge the gap between legislative commands and technical operationalisation, thereby enabling a structured discourse between technical and legal experts."}

This paper argues that this fragmentation cannot be explained solely by geopolitical rivalry, institutional complexity, or instrument selection. Instead, it stems from how AI is constituted as an object of governance through distinct institutional logics. Integrating securitisation theory with the concept of the dispositif, we demonstrate that jurisdictions govern ontologically different objects under the same vocabulary. Using semantic network analysis of official policy texts from the European Union, the United States, and China (2023-2025), we trace how concepts like safety are embedded within divergent semantic architectures. Our findings reveal that the EU juridifies AI as a certifiable product through legal-bureaucratic logic; the US operationalises AI as an optimisable system through market-liberal logic; and China governs AI as socio-technical infrastructure through holistic state logic. We introduce the concept of structural incommensurability to describe this condition of ontological divergence masked by terminological convergence. This reframing challenges ethics-by-principles approaches to global AI governance, suggesting that coordination failures arise not from disagreement over values but from the absence of a shared reference object."}

We present a comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding drift phenomena, proposing three distinct manifestations: semantic drift (progressive deviation from original intent), coordination drift (breakdown in multi-agent consensus mechanisms), and behavioral drift (emergence of unintended strategies).\n  We introduce the Agent Stability Index (ASI), a novel composite metric framework for quantifying drift across twelve dimensions, including response consistency, tool usage patterns, reasoning pathway stability, and inter-agent agreement rates. Through simulation-based analysis and theoretical modeling, we demonstrate how unchecked agent drift can lead to substantial reductions in task completion accuracy and increased human intervention requirements.\n  We propose three mitigation strategies: episodic memory consolidation, drift-aware routing protocols, and adaptive behavioral anchoring. Theoretical analysis suggests these approaches can significantly reduce drift-related errors while maintaining system throughput.

This emerging field -- legal alignment -- focuses on three research directions: (1) designing AI systems to comply with the content of legal rules developed through legitimate institutions and processes, (2) adapting methods from legal interpretation to guide how AI systems reason and make decisions, and (3) harnessing legal concepts as a structural blueprint for confronting challenges of reliability, trust, and cooperation in AI systems. These research directions present new conceptual, empirical, and institutional questions, which include examining the specific set of laws that particular AI systems should follow, creating evaluations to assess their legal compliance in real-world settings, and developing governance frameworks to support the implementation of legal alignment in practice. Tackling these questions requires expertise across law, computer science, and other disciplines, offering these communities the opportunity to collaborate in designing AI for the better."}
