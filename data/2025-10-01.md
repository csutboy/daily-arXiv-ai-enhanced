Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为基本环比率（BCR）的新方法，通过利用基本环和环比率来评估节点重要性，在六个真实社交网络上优于传统中心性度量和其他基于环的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别在复杂网络中具有局部和全局双重角色的有影响力传播者是一个关键但具有挑战性的任务。

Method: 使用基本环和环比率来捕捉节点在局部邻域内的重要性及其在维持网络凝聚力中的全局作用。

Result: 在六个不同的真实世界社交网络上评估BCR，其表现优于传统中心性度量和其他基于环的方法，在选择强大传播者和增强信息传播方面更有效。

Conclusion: BCR为社交网络应用提供了一种经济高效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Spreading processes are fundamental to complex networks. Identifying
influential spreaders with dual local and global roles presents a crucial yet
challenging task. To address this, our study proposes a novel method, the Basic
Cycle Ratio (BCR), for assessing node importance. BCR leverages basic cycles
and the cycle ratio to uniquely capture a node's local significance within its
immediate neighborhood and its global role in maintaining network cohesion. We
evaluated BCR on six diverse real-world social networks. Our method
outperformed traditional centrality measures and other cycle-based approaches,
proving more effective at selecting powerful spreaders and enhancing
information diffusion. Besides, BCR offers a cost-effective and practical
solution for social network applications.

### [3] [The Sandbox Configurator: A Framework to Support Technical Assessment in AI Regulatory Sandboxes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25256)
*Alessio Buscemi,Thibault Simonetto,Daniele Pagani,German Castignani,Maxime Cordy,Jordi Cabot*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 提出了Sandbox Configurator框架，这是一个模块化开源框架，用于创建定制化的AI监管沙盒环境，支持从共享库中选择领域相关测试，并集成仪表板，旨在促进AI系统的标准化评估和合规。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI技术进入高风险领域，系统评估变得至关重要。欧盟AI法案引入AI监管沙盒，但面临评估方法碎片化、测试缺乏标准化、开发者与监管者反馈循环薄弱等挑战。

Method: 开发Sandbox Configurator框架，采用模块化开源设计，支持从共享库选择测试并生成定制沙盒环境，具有插件架构，支持开放和专有模块。

Result: 该框架为不同利益相关者提供结构化工作流程：监管机构获得应用法律义务的结构化流程，技术专家可集成稳健评估方法，AI提供商获得透明的合规路径。

Conclusion: 通过促进跨境合作和标准化，Sandbox Configurator旨在支持可扩展且创新友好的欧洲可信AI治理基础设施。

Abstract: The systematic assessment of AI systems is increasingly vital as these
technologies enter high-stakes domains. To address this, the EU's Artificial
Intelligence Act introduces AI Regulatory Sandboxes (AIRS): supervised
environments where AI systems can be tested under the oversight of Competent
Authorities (CAs), balancing innovation with compliance, particularly for
startups and SMEs. Yet significant challenges remain: assessment methods are
fragmented, tests lack standardisation, and feedback loops between developers
and regulators are weak. To bridge these gaps, we propose the Sandbox
Configurator, a modular open-source framework that enables users to select
domain-relevant tests from a shared library and generate customised sandbox
environments with integrated dashboards. Its plug-in architecture aims to
support both open and proprietary modules, fostering a shared ecosystem of
interoperable AI assessment services. The framework aims to address multiple
stakeholders: CAs gain structured workflows for applying legal obligations;
technical experts can integrate robust evaluation methods; and AI providers
access a transparent pathway to compliance. By promoting cross-border
collaboration and standardisation, the Sandbox Configurator's goal is to
support a scalable and innovation-friendly European infrastructure for
trustworthy AI governance.

Abstract: Practical lab education in computer science often faces challenges such as
plagiarism, lack of proper lab records, unstructured lab conduction, inadequate
execution and assessment, limited practical learning, low student engagement,
and absence of progress tracking for both students and faculties, resulting in
graduates with insufficient hands-on skills. In this paper, we introduce
AsseslyAI, which addresses these challenges through online lab allocation, a
unique lab problem for each student, AI-proctored viva evaluations, and
gamified simulators to enhance engagement and conceptual mastery. While
existing platforms generate questions based on topics, our framework fine-tunes
on a 10k+ question-answer dataset built from AI/ML lab questions to dynamically
generate diverse, code-rich assessments. Validation metrics show high
question-answer similarity, ensuring accurate answers and non-repetitive
questions. By unifying dataset-driven question generation, adaptive difficulty,
plagiarism resistance, and evaluation in a single pipeline, our framework
advances beyond traditional automated grading tools and offers a scalable path
to produce genuinely skilled graduates.

Abstract: The evolution of digital communication systems and the designs of online
platforms have inadvertently facilitated the subconscious propagation of toxic
behavior. Giving rise to reactive responses to toxic behavior. Toxicity in
online content and Artificial Intelligence Systems has become a serious
challenge to individual and collective well-being around the world. It is more
detrimental to society than we realize. Toxicity, expressed in language, image,
and video, can be interpreted in various ways depending on the context of
usage. Therefore, a comprehensive taxonomy is crucial to detect and mitigate
toxicity in online content, Artificial Intelligence systems, and/or Large
Language Models in a proactive manner. A comprehensive understanding of
toxicity is likely to facilitate the design of practical solutions for toxicity
detection and mitigation. The classification in published literature has
focused on only a limited number of aspects of this very complex issue, with a
pattern of reactive strategies in response to toxicity. This survey attempts to
generate a comprehensive taxonomy of toxicity from various perspectives. It
presents a holistic approach to explain the toxicity by understanding the
context and environment that society is facing in the Artificial Intelligence
era. This survey summarizes the toxicity-related datasets and research on
toxicity detection and mitigation for Large Language Models, social media
platforms, and other online platforms, detailing their attributes in textual
mode, focused on the English language. Finally, we suggest the research gaps in
toxicity mitigation based on datasets, mitigation strategies, Large Language
Models, adaptability, explainability, and evaluation.

### [6] [Cognifying Education: Mapping AI's transformative role in emotional, creative, and collaborative learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25266)
*Mikael Gorsky,Ilya Levin*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 本文通过整合理论概念与实证观察，分析了AI在教育七个关键领域的能力、机遇和最佳实践，认为AI能够补充和增强人类教育者，创造更丰富的学习体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI正在重塑教育实践，挑战传统的教学和学习假设，需要系统性地探讨AI在教育各领域的潜力和应用方式。

Method: 整合Eric Schmidt、Ethan Mollick和Kevin Kelly等著作的理论观点，结合AI播客和Anthropic公开发布的实证见解，分析七个教育领域。

Result: 发现AI在情感支持、创造力、情境理解、学生参与、问题解决、伦理道德和协作等领域都能发挥积极作用，增强学习体验。

Conclusion: 应采取乐观而负责任的态度，让教育者和学生主动塑造AI整合，在保持以人为本价值观的同时，放大人类在创造力、伦理推理和协作等方面的潜力。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly reshaping educational practice,
challenging long held assumptions about teaching and learning. This article
integrates conceptual perspectives from recent books (Genesis by Eric Schmidt,
Henry Kissinger and Craig Mundie, CoIntelligence by Ethan Mollick, and The
Inevitable by Kevin Kelly) with empirical insights from popular AI podcasts and
Anthropic public releases. We examine seven key domains: emotional support,
creativity, contextual understanding, student engagement, problem solving,
ethics and morality, and collaboration. For each domain, we explore AI
capabilities, opportunities for transformative change, and emerging best
practices, drawing equally from theoretical analysis and real world
observations. Overall, we find that AI, when used thoughtfully, can complement
and enhance human educators in fostering richer learning experiences across
cognitive, social, and emotional dimensions. We emphasize an optimistic yet
responsible outlook: educators and students should actively shape AI
integration to amplify human potential in creativity, ethical reasoning,
collaboration, and beyond, while maintaining a focus on human centric values.

### [7] [Effectiveness of Large Language Models in Simulating Regional Psychological Structures: An Empirical Examination of Personality and Subjective Well-being](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25283)
*Ke Luoma,Li Zengyi,Liao Jiangqun,Tong Song,Peng Kaiping*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 研究探讨LLMs能否基于人口统计信息模拟文化背景下的心理模式，发现AI生成数据与真实人类数据在人格特质和幸福感上存在系统性差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证LLMs在模拟文化心理模式方面的能力，探索AI虚拟参与者在大规模心理学研究中的潜力与局限性。

Method: 使用DeepSeek生成2943名虚拟参与者，匹配CFPS2018人口分布，与中国七个地区的人类参与者进行大五人格和主观幸福感的比较。

Result: 模拟数据与真实数据在区域变化趋势上相似，但存在系统性差异：AI在外向性和开放性上得分较低，在宜人性和神经质上得分较高，幸福感评分持续偏低；预测结构也不同。

Conclusion: LLMs能够近似群体层面的心理分布，但低估了文化特定性和情感维度，需要文化丰富的训练数据和改进的情感建模。

Abstract: This study examines whether LLMs can simulate culturally grounded
psychological patterns based on demographic information. Using DeepSeek, we
generated 2943 virtual participants matched to demographic distributions from
the CFPS2018 and compared them with human responses on the Big Five personality
traits and subjective well-being across seven Chinese regions.Personality was
measured using a 15-item Chinese Big Five inventory, and happiness with a
single-item rating. Results revealed broad similarity between real and
simulated datasets, particularly in regional variation trends. However,
systematic differences emerged:simulated participants scored lower in
extraversion and openness, higher in agreeableness and neuroticism, and
consistently reported lower happiness. Predictive structures also diverged:
while human data identified conscientiousness, extraversion and openness as
positive predictors of happiness, the AI emphasized openness and agreeableness,
with extraversion predicting negatively. These discrepancies suggest that while
LLMs can approximate population-level psychological distributions, they
underrepresent culturally specific and affective dimensions. The findings
highlight both the potential and limitations of LLM-based virtual participants
for large-scale psychological research and underscore the need for culturally
enriched training data and improved affective modeling.

### [8] [Artificial Authority: From Machine Minds to Political Alignments. An Experimental Analysis of Democratic and Autocratic Biases in Large-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25286)
*Szymon Łukasik,Natalia Ożegalska-Łukasik*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 该论文分析大型语言模型是否表现出与民主或专制世界观一致的倾向，发现模型之间存在高度变异性，且与模型开发国家的政治文化密切相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究生成式AI特别是LLMs在政治空间中的角色，这些模型在大规模语料上训练，会复制和传播社会政治假设，需要分析其政治倾向。

Method: 使用现有的心理测量和政治倾向测量工具，对在不同政治背景下开发的领先LLMs进行实验测试，基于数值评分和模型响应的定性分析。

Result: 发现模型之间存在高度变异性，且与模型开发国家的政治文化有强烈关联。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调需要对AI系统中嵌入的社会政治维度进行更详细的检查。

Abstract: Political beliefs vary significantly across different countries, reflecting
distinct historical, cultural, and institutional contexts. These ideologies,
ranging from liberal democracies to rigid autocracies, influence human
societies, as well as the digital systems that are constructed within those
societies. The advent of generative artificial intelligence, particularly Large
Language Models (LLMs), introduces new agents in the political space-agents
trained on massive corpora that replicate and proliferate socio-political
assumptions. This paper analyses whether LLMs display propensities consistent
with democratic or autocratic world-views. We validate this insight through
experimental tests in which we experiment with the leading LLMs developed
across disparate political contexts, using several existing psychometric and
political orientation measures. The analysis is based on both numerical scoring
and qualitative analysis of the models' responses. Findings indicate high
model-to-model variability and a strong association with the political culture
of the country in which the model was developed. These findings highlight the
need for more detailed examination of the socio-political dimensions embedded
within AI systems.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 这是首个对MCP生态系统的大规模实证研究，通过MCPCrawler框架收集分析8,401个有效项目，发现超过一半项目无效或低价值，服务器存在结构性风险，客户端处于协议过渡阶段。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MCP作为连接LLM与外部工具的统一标准，虽然快速采用但发展轨迹不确定，需要实证研究来验证其市场增长、安全性和标准化程度。

Method: 设计实现MCPCrawler系统化测量框架，从6个主要市场收集数据，在14天活动中分析17,630个原始条目中的8,401个有效项目。

Result: 发现超过50%项目无效或低价值，服务器面临依赖单一化和维护不均等结构性风险，客户端在协议和连接模式上处于过渡阶段。

Conclusion: 研究首次提供了MCP生态系统的证据基础视图，揭示了其风险和未来发展趋势，为生态系统健康发展提供了重要参考。

Abstract: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) has been proposed as a unifying standard for
connecting large language models (LLMs) with external tools and resources,
promising the same role for AI integration that HTTP and USB played for the Web
and peripherals. Yet, despite rapid adoption and hype, its trajectory remains
uncertain. Are MCP marketplaces truly growing, or merely inflated by
placeholders and abandoned prototypes? Are servers secure and
privacy-preserving, or do they expose users to systemic risks? And do clients
converge on standardized protocols, or remain fragmented across competing
designs? In this paper, we present the first large-scale empirical study of the
MCP ecosystem. We design and implement MCPCrawler, a systematic measurement
framework that collects and normalizes data from six major markets. Over a
14-day campaign, MCPCrawler aggregated 17,630 raw entries, of which 8,401 valid
projects (8,060 servers and 341 clients) were analyzed. Our results reveal that
more than half of listed projects are invalid or low-value, that servers face
structural risks including dependency monocultures and uneven maintenance, and
that clients exhibit a transitional phase in protocol and connection patterns.
Together, these findings provide the first evidence-based view of the MCP
ecosystem, its risks, and its future trajectory.

*Syed Hassan Raza,Azib Farooq*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 调查巴基斯坦K-12学校AI采用情况，发现教师对AI持积极态度，但使用不均衡，内容生成是最常见应用，需要培训支持确保包容性实施。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发展中国家学校中AI的采用情况，特别是在巴基斯坦K-12教育环境中，了解AI的使用模式、采用程度和感知影响。

Method: 对125名巴基斯坦教育工作者进行问卷调查，涵盖对AI的熟悉程度、使用频率和模式，以及对AI益处和挑战的态度。

Result: 超过三分之二的教师愿意在适当支持下采用AI工具，三分之一频繁使用AI工具，内容生成是最常见应用，AI驱动评分很少使用，教师报告学生参与度和效率有适度改善。

Conclusion: 巴基斯坦学校对AI潜力充满热情，但需要培训和基础设施来确保包容有效的实施，解决公平获取问题。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly permeating classrooms worldwide,
yet its adoption in schools of developing countries remains under-explored.
This paper investigates AI adoption, usage patterns, and perceived impact in
Pakistani K-12 schools based on a survey of 125 educators. The questionnaire
covered educator's familiarity with AI, frequency and modes of use, and
attitudes toward AI's benefits and challenges. Results reveal a generally
positive disposition towards AI: over two-thirds of teachers expressed
willingness to adopt AI tools given proper support and many have begun
integrating AI for lesson planning and content creation. However, AI usage is
uneven - while about one-third of respondents actively use AI tools frequently,
others remain occasional users. Content generation emerged as the most common
AI application, whereas AI-driven grading and feedback are rarely used.
Teachers reported moderate improvements in student engagement and efficiency
due to AI, but also voiced concerns about equitable access. These findings
highlight both the enthusiasm for AI's potential in Pakistan's schools and the
need for training and infrastructure to ensure inclusive and effective
implementation.

### [11] [Trajectories and Comparative Analysis of Global Countries Dominating AI Publications, 2000-2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25298)
*Jason Hung*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 该研究分析了2000-2025年全球AI研究格局的转变，显示美国欧盟相对份额大幅下降，中国崛起为最大贡献者，印度也显著增长，形成了多极化的亚洲研究生态系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 调查全球AI研究动态的变化，了解各国在AI研究领域的相对地位演变，特别是传统领导者与新兴力量之间的格局重组。

Method: 使用OpenAlex数据集，采用分数计数法避免合著作品的重复归属，分析主要国家AI出版物的相对份额变化。

Result: 美国欧盟份额从57%降至25%，中国从5%升至36%成为最大贡献者，印度也大幅增长，形成多极化亚洲研究生态系统。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了AI研究格局的重大重组，中国已具备塑造AI创新和标准制定未来方向的能力，但需进一步研究高质量AI学术成果的影响。

Abstract: This study investigates the shifting global dynamics of Artificial
Intelligence (AI) research by analysing the trajectories of countries
dominating AI publications between 2000 and 2025. Drawing on the comprehensive
OpenAlex dataset and employing fractional counting to avoid double attribution
in co-authored work, the research maps the relative shares of AI publications
across major global players. The analysis reveals a profound restructuring of
the international AI research landscape. The US and the European Union (EU27),
once the undisputed and established leaders, have experienced a notable decline
in relative dominance, with their combined share of publications falling from
over 57% in 2000 to less than 25% in 2025. In contrast, China has undergone a
dramatic ascent, expanding its global share of AI publications from under 5% in
2000 to nearly 36% by 2025, thereby emerging as the single most dominant
contributor. Alongside China, India has also risen substantially, consolidating
a multipolar Asian research ecosystem. These empirical findings highlight the
strategic implications of concentrated research output, particularly China's
capacity to shape the future direction of AI innovation and standard-setting.
While the study calculates the volume of AI publications (in percentage as
global share) as a measure of research dominance, it also acknowledges
limitations in capturing quality and impact, suggesting scholarly research
areas for future work on high-impact AI scholarship.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 该论文分析了AI音乐研究领域的伦理声明使用现状，发现大多数伦理声明未能有效促进对研究影响的批判性思考，并提出了改进建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI音乐生成和分析研究快速发展，但研究者对伦理问题的关注不足。尽管许多会议引入了伦理声明要求，但这些声明往往流于形式，未能真正促进伦理反思。

Method: 对过去五年ISMIR、NIME会议和AI音乐领域重要论文中的伦理声明进行系统性回顾分析。

Result: 研究发现大多数伦理声明未能有效用于批判性思考研究的社会影响，而是倾向于形式化合规。

Conclusion: 建议音频会议和研究人员采用能促进真正反思而非形式化合规的伦理声明方式。

Abstract: While research in AI methods for music generation and analysis has grown in
scope and impact, AI researchers' engagement with the ethical consequences of
this work has not kept pace. To encourage such engagement, many publication
venues have introduced optional or required ethics statements for AI research
papers. Though some authors use these ethics statements to critically engage
with the broader implications of their research, we find that the majority of
ethics statements in the AI music literature do not appear to be effectively
utilized for this purpose. In this work, we conduct a review of ethics
statements across ISMIR, NIME, and selected prominent works in AI music from
the past five years. We then offer suggestions for both audio conferences and
researchers for engaging with ethics statements in ways that foster meaningful
reflection rather than formulaic compliance.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个将AI政策讨论整合到计算机科学课程中的框架，强调需要培养AI工程师适应不断发展的监管环境的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI技术在社会中的普及凸显了负责任使用的重要性，但现有文献显示AI治理伦理原则存在异质性，且计算机科学课程中缺乏AI政策影响的讨论。

Method: 总结了美国和欧盟的AI政策努力，提出了在技术和非技术CS课程中围绕AI政策进行课堂讨论的指导性问题框架。

Result: 建立了一个连接规范性政策需求与未解决技术挑战的框架，强调通过代码和治理结构实现政策实施与执行的联系。

Conclusion: 本文为弥合AI政策与CS教育之间的研究差距做出了贡献，强调需要培养AI工程师与适应社会政策偏好的能力。

Abstract: The growth and permeation of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies across
society has drawn focus to the ways in which the responsible use of these
technologies can be facilitated through AI governance. Increasingly, large
companies and governments alike have begun to articulate and, in some cases,
enforce governance preferences through AI policy. Yet existing literature
documents an unwieldy heterogeneity in ethical principles for AI governance,
while our own prior research finds that discussions of the implications of AI
policy are not yet present in the computer science (CS) curriculum. In this
context, overlapping jurisdictions and even contradictory policy preferences
across private companies, local, national, and multinational governments create
a complex landscape for AI policy which, we argue, will require AI developers
able adapt to an evolving regulatory environment. Preparing computing students
for the new challenges of an AI-dominated technology industry is therefore a
key priority for the CS curriculum.
  In this discussion paper, we seek to articulate a framework for integrating
discussions on the nascent AI policy landscape into computer science courses.
We begin by summarizing recent AI policy efforts in the United States and
European Union. Subsequently, we propose guiding questions to frame class
discussions around AI policy in technical and non-technical (e.g., ethics) CS
courses. Throughout, we emphasize the connection between normative policy
demands and still-open technical challenges relating to their implementation
and enforcement through code and governance structures. This paper therefore
represents a valuable contribution towards bridging research and discussions
across the areas of AI policy and CS education, underlining the need to prepare
AI engineers to interact with and adapt to societal policy preferences.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 开发了一个基于大语言模型的个性化自动评分和反馈系统，用于几何构造任务，在韩国Algeomath平台上部署测试，评分与教师判断高度一致，反馈帮助学生修正错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着个性化学习在数学教育中日益受到重视，需要能够评估复杂学生回答并提供实时个性化反馈的智能系统。

Method: 使用GPT-4的提示式评分机制，通过少样本学习方法比较学生答案和模型解决方案，基于教师编写的预期学生回答示例生成反馈，并根据学生解题历史动态调整，允许每个问题最多四次迭代尝试。

Result: 在79名初中生中试点测试，LLM生成的评分与教师判断高度一致，反馈帮助许多学生修正错误并完成多步骤几何任务，短期修正效果明显但长期迁移效果不明确。

Conclusion: 研究突显了LLM在支持数学中可扩展、教师对齐的形成性评估方面的潜力，同时指出在术语处理和反馈设计方面需要改进。

Abstract: As personalized learning gains increasing attention in mathematics education,
there is a growing demand for intelligent systems that can assess complex
student responses and provide individualized feedback in real time. In this
study, we present a personalized auto-grading and feedback system for
constructive geometry tasks, developed using large language models (LLMs) and
deployed on the Algeomath platform, a Korean online tool designed for
interactive geometric constructions. The proposed system evaluates
student-submitted geometric constructions by analyzing their procedural
accuracy and conceptual understanding. It employs a prompt-based grading
mechanism using GPT-4, where student answers and model solutions are compared
through a few-shot learning approach. Feedback is generated based on
teacher-authored examples built from anticipated student responses, and it
dynamically adapts to the student's problem-solving history, allowing up to
four iterative attempts per question. The system was piloted with 79
middle-school students, where LLM-generated grades and feedback were
benchmarked against teacher judgments. Grading closely aligned with teachers,
and feedback helped many students revise errors and complete multi-step
geometry tasks. While short-term corrections were frequent, longer-term
transfer effects were less clear. Overall, the study highlights the potential
of LLMs to support scalable, teacher-aligned formative assessment in
mathematics, while pointing to improvements needed in terminology handling and
feedback design.

Abstract: Peer review is the primary mechanism for evaluating scientific contributions,
yet prior studies have mostly examined paper features or external metadata in
isolation. The emergence of open platforms such as OpenReview has transformed
peer review into a transparent and interactive process, recording not only
scores and comments but also rebuttals, reviewer-author exchanges, reviewer
disagreements, and meta-reviewer decisions. This provides unprecedented
process-level data for understanding how modern peer review operates. In this
paper, we present a large-scale empirical study of ICLR 2017-2025, encompassing
over 28,000 submissions. Our analysis integrates four complementary dimensions,
including the structure and language quality of papers (e.g., section patterns,
figure/table ratios, clarity), submission strategies and external metadata
(e.g., timing, arXiv posting, author count), the dynamics of author-reviewer
interactions (e.g., rebuttal frequency, responsiveness), and the patterns of
reviewer disagreement and meta-review mediation (e.g., score variance,
confidence weighting). Our results show that factors beyond scientific novelty
significantly shape acceptance outcomes. In particular, the rebuttal stage
emerges as a decisive phase: timely, substantive, and interactive
author-reviewer communication strongly increases the likelihood of acceptance,
often outweighing initial reviewer skepticism. Alongside this, clearer writing,
balanced visual presentation, earlier submission, and effective resolution of
reviewer disagreement also correlate with higher acceptance probabilities.
Based on these findings, we propose data-driven guidelines for authors,
reviewers, and meta-reviewers to enhance transparency and fairness in peer
review. Our study demonstrates that process-centric signals are essential for
understanding and improving modern peer review.

### [16] [Bubble, Bubble, AI's Rumble: Why Global Financial Regulatory Incident Reporting is Our Shield Against Systemic Stumbles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26150)
*Anchal Gupta,Gleb Pappyshev,James T Kwok*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 提出监管级全球数据库来解决AI系统在资本市场中的透明度危机，通过综合交易后报告框架和事件记录模型，实现跨司法管辖区风险分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI事件数据库依赖众包或新闻抓取，系统性地忽略了资本市场异常，特别是算法和高频交易中的风险，如2024年8月5日日美股市暴跌所示。

Method: 提出监管级全球数据库，优雅地综合交易后报告框架与医疗和航空领域已验证的事件记录模型，采用时间数据省略技术保护商业机密同时保留百分比指标。

Result: 合成数据验证显示：系统性风险跨越地理边界，市场操纵集群可通过K-means算法识别，AI系统类型对交易行为的影响远超地理位置。

Conclusion: 该三方解决方案为监管机构提供前所未有的跨司法管辖区监督能力，金融机构实现无缝合规整合，投资者获得对AI驱动漏洞的关键可见性，呼吁立即行动加强AI驱动金融市场的风险管理。

Abstract: "Double, double toil and trouble; Fire burn and cauldron bubble." As
Shakespeare's witches foretold chaos through cryptic prophecies, modern capital
markets grapple with systemic risks concealed by opaque AI systems. According
to IMF, the August 5, 2024, plunge in Japanese and U.S. equities can be linked
to algorithmic trading yet ab-sent from existing AI incidents database
exemplifies this transparency crisis. Current AI incident databases, reliant on
crowdsourcing or news scraping, systematically over-look capital market
anomalies, particularly in algorithmic and high-frequency trading. We address
this critical gap by proposing a regulatory-grade global database that
elegantly synthesises post-trade reporting frameworks with proven incident
documentation models from healthcare and aviation. Our framework's temporal
data omission technique masking timestamps while preserving percent-age-based
metrics enables sophisticated cross-jurisdictional analysis of emerging risks
while safeguarding confidential business information. Synthetic data validation
(modelled after real life published incidents , sentiments, data) reveals
compelling pat-terns: systemic risks transcending geographical boundaries,
market manipulation clusters distinctly identifiable via K-means algorithms,
and AI system typology exerting significantly greater influence on trading
behaviour than geographical location, This tripartite solution empowers
regulators with unprecedented cross-jurisdictional oversight, financial
institutions with seamless compliance integration, and investors with critical
visibility into previously obscured AI-driven vulnerabilities. We call for
immediate action to strengthen risk management and foster resilience in
AI-driven financial markets against the volatile "cauldron" of AI-driven
systemic risks., promoting global financial stability through enhanced
transparency and coordinated oversight.

TL;DR: 本文分析了女性在科技领域代表性不足的问题，探讨了心理和社会障碍，并提出了包括教育实践、组织改革、指导和心理支持在内的综合解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决女性在科技领域代表性不足的全球危机，这一问题不仅限制了人才获取，还减少了塑造技术创新的观点多样性。

Method: 采用结构化文献综述方法，收集关于早期性别刻板印象、教育职业选择障碍以及女性在专业环境中面临的心理挑战的证据。

Result: 研究发现有效的解决方案需要超越反歧视政策，应包括教育实践、组织改革、指导和心理支持。特别关注德国的情况和NEURON项目作为试点跨学科倡议。

Conclusion: 解决科技领域的性别差距需要多层面的综合干预，包括教育、组织改革和心理支持，NEURON项目展示了加速赋权努力和开发新项目的潜力。

Abstract: Recently, the unequal presence of women compared to men in technology has
attracted the attention of researchers and practitioners across multiple
fields. It is time to regard this problem as a global crisis that not only
limits access to talent but also reduces the diversity of perspectives that
shape technological innovation. This article examines the psychological and
social barriers that influence this gap, as well as the interventions designed
to reduce it. Using a structured review, the findings assemble evidence on the
role of early gender stereotypes in the family and school and the continuation
of this crisis in educational and career choices, through to the psychological
challenges women face in professional settings, such as feelings of
self-undervaluation, occupational anxiety, a heightened fear of technology, and
structural limitations in educational environments. Special attention is paid
to Germany, where the technology gap is particularly evident and where multiple
national programs have been implemented to address it. The present review shows
that effective solutions require more than anti-discrimination policies: they
should include educational practices, organizational reforms, mentoring, and
psychological support. The article concludes by outlining practical and
research implications and introduces the NEURON project as a pilot
interdisciplinary initiative aimed at accelerating current empowerment efforts
and developing new programs for women in technology occupations.

### [18] [A systematic comparison of Large Language Models for automated assignment assessment in programming education: Exploring the importance of architecture and vendor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26483)
*Marcin Jukiewicz*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 本研究首次大规模比较了18个当代大语言模型在编程作业自动评分中的表现，发现模型之间存在系统性差异，小型变体表现较差，所有模型与人类教师评分仅有中等一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在教育领域的应用日益增多，需要系统评估不同模型在编程作业自动评分中的表现差异，以指导教育部署选择。

Method: 使用超过6,000份学生编程作业提交，对18个公开可用的大语言模型进行系统分析，包括统计分析、相关性分析和聚类分析。

Result: 发现模型间存在明显的系统性差异，"mini"和"nano"变体表现一致较差，所有模型内部一致性高但与人类教师评分仅有中等一致性。

Conclusion: 模型选择对教育部署并非中立，应基于教学目标、透明报告评估指标和持续人工监督来确保准确性、公平性和相关性。

Abstract: This study presents the first large-scale, side-by-side comparison of
contemporary Large Language Models (LLMs) in the automated grading of
programming assignments. Drawing on over 6,000 student submissions collected
across four years of an introductory programming course, we systematically
analysed the distribution of grades, differences in mean scores and variability
reflecting stricter or more lenient grading, and the consistency and clustering
of grading patterns across models. Eighteen publicly available models were
evaluated: Anthropic (claude-3-5-haiku, claude-opus-4-1, claude-sonnet-4);
Deepseek (deepseek-chat, deepseek-reasoner); Google (gemini-2.0-flash-lite,
gemini-2.0-flash, gemini-2.5-flash-lite, gemini-2.5-flash, gemini-2.5-pro); and
OpenAI (gpt-4.1-mini, gpt-4.1-nano, gpt-4.1, gpt-4o-mini, gpt-4o, gpt-5-mini,
gpt-5-nano, gpt-5). Statistical tests, correlation and clustering analyses
revealed clear, systematic differences between and within vendor families, with
"mini" and "nano" variants consistently underperforming their full-scale
counterparts. All models displayed high internal agreement, measured by the
intraclass correlation coefficient, with the model consensus but only moderate
agreement with human teachers' grades, indicating a persistent gap between
automated and human assessment. These findings underscore that the choice of
model for educational deployment is not neutral and should be guided by
pedagogical goals, transparent reporting of evaluation metrics, and ongoing
human oversight to ensure accuracy, fairness and relevance.

*Olga Krestinskaya,Mohammed E. Fouda,Ahmed Eltawil,Khaled N. Salama*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CIMNAS是一个联合模型-量化-硬件优化框架，用于存内计算架构的神经网络加速器设计，通过硬件感知的神经架构搜索技术实现软硬件参数协同优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了最大化存内计算架构神经网络加速器的硬件效率和性能精度，需要协同优化软件和硬件设计参数，但手动调优因参数数量庞大且相互依赖复杂而不切实际。

Method: CIMNAS框架同时搜索软件参数、量化策略和广泛的硬件参数，包含器件级、电路级和架构级的协同优化，支持RRAM和SRAM等多种存内计算架构。

Result: 在ImageNet数据集上，CIMNAS相比基准实现了90.1x-104.5x的能耗-延迟-面积乘积降低，4.68x-4.82x的TOPS/W提升，11.3x-12.78x的TOPS/mm²提升，同时保持73.81%的准确率。

Conclusion: CIMNAS实现了无精度损失的能耗-延迟-面积乘积优化，为高性能存内计算神经网络设计生成多样化的软硬件参数组合，展现出良好的适应性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: To maximize hardware efficiency and performance accuracy in Compute-In-Memory
(CIM)-based neural network accelerators for Artificial Intelligence (AI)
applications, co-optimizing both software and hardware design parameters is
essential. Manual tuning is impractical due to the vast number of parameters
and their complex interdependencies. To effectively automate the design and
optimization of CIM-based neural network accelerators, hardware-aware neural
architecture search (HW-NAS) techniques can be applied. This work introduces
CIMNAS, a joint model-quantization-hardware optimization framework for CIM
architectures. CIMNAS simultaneously searches across software parameters,
quantization policies, and a broad range of hardware parameters, incorporating
device-, circuit-, and architecture-level co-optimizations. CIMNAS experiments
were conducted over a search space of 9.9x10^85 potential parameter
combinations with the MobileNet model as a baseline and RRAM-based CIM
architecture. Evaluated on the ImageNet dataset, CIMNAS achieved a reduction in
energy-delay-area product (EDAP) ranging from 90.1x to 104.5x, an improvement
in TOPS/W between 4.68x and 4.82x, and an enhancement in TOPS/mm^2 from 11.3x
to 12.78x relative to various baselines, all while maintaining an accuracy of
73.81%. The adaptability and robustness of CIMNAS are demonstrated by extending
the framework to support the SRAM-based ResNet50 architecture, achieving up to
an 819.5x reduction in EDAP. Unlike other state-of-the-art methods, CIMNAS
achieves EDAP-focused optimization without any accuracy loss, generating
diverse software-hardware parameter combinations for high-performance CIM-based
neural network designs. The source code of CIMNAS is available at

TL;DR: Blueprint-Bench是一个评估AI模型空间推理能力的基准测试，通过将公寓照片转换为2D平面图来测试空间重建能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代多模态模型虽然能处理照片输入，但空间重建任务需要真正的空间智能，包括推断房间布局、理解连通性和保持比例一致性。

Method: 评估了领先的语言模型、图像生成模型和代理系统在50个公寓数据集上的表现，使用基于房间连通图和大小的评分算法。

Result: 结果显示当前AI存在显著盲点，大多数模型表现接近或低于随机基线，而人类表现明显更优。图像生成模型尤其不擅长遵循指令。

Conclusion: 该基准为比较不同模型架构的空间智能提供了首个数值框架，将持续评估新模型以监测通用AI系统中空间智能的出现。

Abstract: We introduce Blueprint-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate spatial
reasoning capabilities in AI models through the task of converting apartment
photographs into accurate 2D floor plans. While the input modality
(photographs) is well within the training distribution of modern multimodal
models, the task of spatial reconstruction requires genuine spatial
intelligence: inferring room layouts, understanding connectivity, and
maintaining consistent scale. We evaluate leading language models (GPT-5,
Claude 4 Opus, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Grok-4), image generation models (GPT-Image,
NanoBanana), and agent systems (Codex CLI, Claude Code) on a dataset of 50
apartments with approximately 20 interior images each. Our scoring algorithm
measures similarity between generated and ground-truth floor plans based on
room connectivity graphs and size rankings. Results reveal a significant blind
spot in current AI capabilities: most models perform at or below a random
baseline, while human performance remains substantially superior. Image
generation models particularly struggle with instruction following, while
agent-based approaches with iterative refinement capabilities show no
meaningful improvement over single-pass generation. Blueprint-Bench provides
the first numerical framework for comparing spatial intelligence across
different model architectures. We will continue evaluating new models as they
are released and welcome community submissions, monitoring for the emergence of
spatial intelligence in generalist AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 增强人工智能的可解释性、可信性和鲁棒性，通过构建结构因果模型的网络层结构来形式化因果知识。

Method: 引入因果抽象网络(CAN)，使用高斯SCM，限制映射为构造性线性因果抽象，提出分离的局部黎曼优化问题和SPECTRAL迭代方法。

Result: 在合成数据上的实验显示，在因果抽象学习任务中具有竞争力，并成功恢复了多样化的CAN结构。

Conclusion: CAN为因果AI提供了理论框架和有效的学习算法，能够处理正定和半正定协方差矩阵，具有良好的理论性质。

Abstract: Causal artificial intelligence aims to enhance explainability,
trustworthiness, and robustness in AI by leveraging structural causal models
(SCMs). In this pursuit, recent advances formalize network sheaves of causal
knowledge. Pushing in the same direction, we introduce the causal abstraction
network (CAN), a specific instance of such sheaves where (i) SCMs are Gaussian,
(ii) restriction maps are transposes of constructive linear causal abstractions
(CAs), and (iii) edge stalks correspond -- up to rotation -- to the node stalks
of more detailed SCMs. We investigate the theoretical properties of CAN,
including algebraic invariants, cohomology, consistency, global sections
characterized via the Laplacian kernel, and smoothness. We then tackle the
learning of consistent CANs. Our problem formulation separates into
edge-specific local Riemannian problems and avoids nonconvex, costly
objectives. We propose an efficient search procedure as a solution, solving the
local problems with SPECTRAL, our iterative method with closed-form updates and
suitable for positive definite and semidefinite covariance matrices.
Experiments on synthetic data show competitive performance in the CA learning
task, and successful recovery of diverse CAN structures.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文比较了思维链（CoT）和循环变换器中的潜在思维两种推理范式，发现潜在思维支持并行计算更高效，而CoT通过随机解码处理难解问题，为选择推理方法提供指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 比较思维链（CoT）和循环变换器中的潜在思维两种推理方法的相对能力，目前这方面的研究还不够深入。

Method: 对循环变换器中的潜在思维进行形式化分析，并与思维链（CoT）方法进行对比研究。

Result: 潜在思维支持并行计算，比CoT的串行过程更高效；而CoT通过随机解码来近似解决难解问题。

Conclusion: 两种方法在不同任务中各有优势：深度驱动递归适合某些任务，为选择推理范式提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) elicits reasoning in large language models by
explicitly generating intermediate steps in natural language. In contrast,
Latent Thought in looped models operates directly in the continuous latent
space, enabling computation beyond discrete linguistic representations. While
both approaches exploit iterative computation, their comparative capabilities
remain underexplored. In this work, we present a formal analysis showing that
Latent Thought in Looped Transformers enables parallel computation, which is
more efficient than the inherently sequential process of CoT. In contrast, CoT
leverages stochastic decoding to approximate solutions to problems where exact
computation is intractable. These separations suggest the tasks for which
depth-driven recursion is more suitable, thereby offering practical guidance
for choosing between reasoning paradigms. Code is available at

*Emma Rose Madden*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs在社会科学中作为合成代理使用时，其输出不应被误解为概率推断，而应被视为在明确范围条件下的准预测插值的高容量模式匹配器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLMs的预测能力、条件提示、token对数概率和重复采样模仿贝叶斯工作流程，其输出容易被误解为来自连贯模型的后验证据，但预测不等于概率论，准确的点估计并不意味着校准的不确定性。

Method: 提出实用的保护措施，包括独立抽样、预注册的人类基线、可靠性感知验证和子组校准，以便研究人员在避免类别错误的同时进行有用的原型设计和预测。

Result: 为社会科学研究提供了一个实用的重新框架，将LLMs视为高容量模式匹配器，用于在明确范围条件下的准预测插值，而不是概率推断的替代品。

Conclusion: 在解释LLM输出时应采取谨慎态度，建议将其作为模式匹配工具而非概率推理工具，并实施相应的保护措施以确保研究的有效性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being increasingly used as synthetic agents
in social science, in applications ranging from augmenting survey responses to
powering multi-agent simulations. Because strong prediction plus conditioning
prompts, token log-probs, and repeated sampling mimic Bayesian workflows, their
outputs can be misinterpreted as posterior-like evidence from a coherent model.
However, prediction does not equate to probabilism, and accurate points do not
imply calibrated uncertainty. This paper outlines cautions that should be taken
when interpreting LLM outputs and proposes a pragmatic reframing for the social
sciences in which LLMs are used as high-capacity pattern matchers for
quasi-predictive interpolation under explicit scope conditions and not as
substitutes for probabilistic inference. Practical guardrails such as
independent draws, preregistered human baselines, reliability-aware validation,
and subgroup calibration, are introduced so that researchers may engage in
useful prototyping and forecasting while avoiding category errors.

TL;DR: NGT结合向量聚类和多智能体系统，解决定性研究的规模深度悖论，能在几小时内分析海量数据同时保持解释严谨性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决定性研究中规模与深度的矛盾，传统方法无法同时处理大数据量和保持解释深度。

Method: 使用1536维嵌入向量、层次聚类和并行智能体编码，对比手动编码和ChatGPT辅助分析。

Result: 速度提升168倍(3小时vs3周)，质量更高(0.904vs0.883)，成本降低96%(从$50,000到$500)，发现手动编码无法识别的模式。

Conclusion: 计算客观性与人类解释互补，向量表示提供可复现的语义测量，研究者从机械编码转向理论指导，AI处理模式识别，人类提供创造性洞察。

Abstract: Purpose: Neo Grounded Theory (NGT) integrates vector clustering with multi
agent systems to resolve qualitative research's scale depth paradox, enabling
analysis of massive datasets in hours while preserving interpretive rigor.
Methods: We compared NGT against manual coding and ChatGPT-assisted analysis
using 40,000 character Chinese interview transcripts. NGT employs
1536-dimensional embeddings, hierarchical clustering, and parallel agent-based
coding. Two experiments tested pure automation versus human guided refinement.
Findings: NGT achieved 168-fold speed improvement (3 hours vs 3 weeks),
superior quality (0.904 vs 0.883), and 96% cost reduction. Human AI
collaboration proved essential: automation alone produced abstract frameworks
while human guidance yielded actionable dual pathway theories. The system
discovered patterns invisible to manual coding, including identity bifurcation
phenomena. Contributions: NGT demonstrates computational objectivity and human
interpretation are complementary. Vector representations provide reproducible
semantic measurement while preserving meaning's interpretive dimensions.
Researchers shift from mechanical coding to theoretical guidance, with AI
handling pattern recognition while humans provide creative insight.
Implications: Cost reduction from \$50,000 to \$500 democratizes qualitative
research, enabling communities to study themselves. Real-time analysis makes
qualitative insights contemporaneous with events. The framework shows
computational methods can strengthen rather than compromise qualitative
research's humanistic commitments.

Motivation: 随着AI原生LCNC平台的发展，自主代理能够执行复杂、长期的业务流程，但面临内存膨胀和上下文退化问题，导致行为不一致、错误累积和计算成本增加。

Method: 设计基于认知科学的混合记忆架构，包含情景记忆和语义记忆组件，采用智能衰退机制，基于新近度、相关性和用户指定效用等综合评分来修剪或整合记忆。

Result: 通过模拟长期运行任务实验，该系统显著优于滑动窗口和基本RAG等传统方法，在任务完成率、上下文一致性和长期令牌成本效率方面表现更优。

Conclusion: 建立了一个新框架，用于构建可靠、透明的AI代理，能够实现有效的长期学习和适应。

Abstract: The rise of AI-native Low-Code/No-Code (LCNC) platforms enables autonomous
agents capable of executing complex, long-duration business processes. However,
a fundamental challenge remains: memory management. As agents operate over
extended periods, they face "memory inflation" and "contextual degradation"
issues, leading to inconsistent behavior, error accumulation, and increased
computational cost. This paper proposes a novel hybrid memory system designed
specifically for LCNC agents. Inspired by cognitive science, our architecture
combines episodic and semantic memory components with a proactive "Intelligent
Decay" mechanism. This mechanism intelligently prunes or consolidates memories
based on a composite score factoring in recency, relevance, and user-specified
utility. A key innovation is a user-centric visualization interface, aligned
with the LCNC paradigm, which allows non-technical users to manage the agent's
memory directly, for instance, by visually tagging which facts should be
retained or forgotten. Through simulated long-running task experiments, we
demonstrate that our system significantly outperforms traditional approaches
like sliding windows and basic RAG, yielding superior task completion rates,
contextual consistency, and long-term token cost efficiency. Our findings
establish a new framework for building reliable, transparent AI agents capable
of effective long-term learning and adaptation.

*Aayush Gupta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Fact Grounded Attention (FGA) 通过在注意力机制中注入可验证知识，将不可靠的语言模型转变为确定性真相讲述者，完全消除可验证事实的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然征服了自然语言，但仍受限于其概率性质，会自信地产生幻觉事实。现有方法要么在生成后修补幻觉，要么在文本前添加检索内容，但无法从根本上解决问题。

Method: FGA在transformer的数学核心——预softmax注意力分数层面进行干预，直接将可验证知识注入注意力机制，当知识库中存在事实时，模型无法产生幻觉。

Result: 在1,107个技术查询测试中，准确率从Llama 3.2的6.3%提升到FGA的99.7%。知识更新可在1秒内完成，而参数编辑方法需要数小时。

Conclusion: FGA不仅减少幻觉，而是完全消除可验证事实的幻觉，标志着从概率近似到确定性精度的根本转变。

Abstract: "The greatest enemy of knowledge is not ignorance, it is the illusion of
knowledge." Large Language Models have conquered natural language but remain
prisoners of their own probabilistic nature--confidently hallucinating facts
they never truly knew. We present Fact Grounded Attention (FGA), a novel
architectural modification that transforms unreliable language models into
deterministic truth tellers by injecting verifiable knowledge directly into the
attention mechanism. Unlike existing approaches that patch hallucinations after
generation or prepend retrieved text, FGA intervenes at the mathematical heart
of the transformer--the pre-softmax attention scores--creating a model that
cannot hallucinate when facts exist in its knowledge base. Our experiments
across 1,107 technical queries spanning smartphones, laptops, and electric
vehicles demonstrate a transformation from 6.3% accuracy in vanilla Llama 3.2
to 99.7% accuracy with FGA. More critically, knowledge updates occur in under
one second without retraining, compared to hours for parameter editing
approaches. FGA doesn't just reduce hallucination--it eliminates it entirely
for verifiable facts, marking a fundamental shift from probabilistic
approximation to deterministic precision in neural language generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解解码器语言模型是否以及如何进行规划（组织中间计算以支持连贯的长程生成），这对模型的可解释性、可靠性和设计原则具有重要意义。

Method: 使用向量量化变分自编码器压缩transformer的隐藏状态，通过互信息测量分析模型的规划行为，在合成语法、路径寻找和自然语言数据集上进行研究。

Result: 发现有效规划范围是任务依赖的，模型隐式保留未使用正确延续的信息，预测主要依赖最近的计算但早期块仍具有信息价值。

Conclusion: 推进了对语言模型中规划实现方式的理解，并提供了一个通用框架来探测深度学习系统的内部动态。

Abstract: The extent to which decoder-only language models (LMs) engage in planning,
that is, organizing intermediate computations to support coherent long-range
generation, remains an open and important question, with implications for
interpretability, reliability, and principled model design. Planning involves
structuring computations over long horizons, considering multiple possible
continuations, and selectively reusing past information, but how effectively
transformer-based LMs realize these capabilities is still unclear. We address
these questions by analyzing the hidden states at the core of transformer
computations, which capture intermediate results and act as carriers of
information. Since these hidden representations are often redundant and
encumbered with fine-grained details, we develop a pipeline based on
vector-quantized variational autoencoders that compresses them into compact
summary codes. These codes enable measuring mutual information, allowing
systematic analysis of the computational structure underlying model behavior.
Using this framework, we study planning in LMs across synthetic grammar,
path-finding tasks, and natural language datasets, focusing on three key
aspects: (i) the planning horizon of pre-output computations, (ii) the extent
to which the model considers alternative valid continuations, and (iii) the
reliance of new predictions on earlier computations. By answering these
questions, we advance the understanding of how planning is realized in LMs and
contribute a general-purpose pipeline for probing the internal dynamics of LMs
and deep learning systems. Our results reveal that the effective planning
horizon is task-dependent, that models implicitly preserve information about
unused correct continuations, and that predictions draw most on recent
computations, though earlier blocks remain informative.

Result: 在包含800个挑战性案例的测试集上，RADAR在准确性、稳定性和自评估风险敏感性等多个维度显著优于基线方法，风险识别准确率比最强基线方法提高了28.87%。

Conclusion: RADAR框架能够全面覆盖显性和隐性风险，同时缓解评估者偏见，为大语言模型安全评估提供了更鲁棒和有效的方法。

Abstract: Existing safety evaluation methods for large language models (LLMs) suffer
from inherent limitations, including evaluator bias and detection failures
arising from model homogeneity, which collectively undermine the robustness of
risk evaluation processes. This paper seeks to re-examine the risk evaluation
paradigm by introducing a theoretical framework that reconstructs the
underlying risk concept space. Specifically, we decompose the latent risk
concept space into three mutually exclusive subspaces: the explicit risk
subspace (encompassing direct violations of safety guidelines), the implicit
risk subspace (capturing potential malicious content that requires contextual
reasoning for identification), and the non-risk subspace. Furthermore, we
propose RADAR, a multi-agent collaborative evaluation framework that leverages
multi-round debate mechanisms through four specialized complementary roles and
employs dynamic update mechanisms to achieve self-evolution of risk concept
distributions. This approach enables comprehensive coverage of both explicit
and implicit risks while mitigating evaluator bias. To validate the
effectiveness of our framework, we construct an evaluation dataset comprising
800 challenging cases. Extensive experiments on our challenging testset and
public benchmarks demonstrate that RADAR significantly outperforms baseline
evaluation methods across multiple dimensions, including accuracy, stability,
and self-evaluation risk sensitivity. Notably, RADAR achieves a 28.87%
improvement in risk identification accuracy compared to the strongest baseline
evaluation method.

TL;DR: 本文对强化学习与可验证奖励（RLVR）在大型语言模型部署中的系统挑战进行了特征研究，识别了GPU闲置、并行策略效率低下、数据管理机制不足和负载不均衡等问题，并提出了PolyTrace基准测试套件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs的广泛应用和RLVR的快速发展，其复杂的数据流和多样化任务给RL训练系统带来了重大挑战，但目前从系统角度对RLVR的理解有限。

Method: 通过特征研究分析RLVR任务在LLM部署中的工作负载分布和变化趋势，识别系统问题，并提出PolyTrace基准测试套件进行现实工作负载评估。

Result: 识别出GPU闲置（由序列长度分布不均引起）、动态变化工作负载中的并行策略效率低下、数据管理机制不足和负载不均衡等问题。PolyTrace基准测试套件在实用案例中表现出94.7%的准确率。

Conclusion: 本文揭示了RLVR引入的系统挑战，呼吁进一步研究剩余开放问题，并验证了PolyTrace基准测试套件的有效性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are now widely used across many domains. With
their rapid development, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)
has surged in recent months to enhance their reasoning and understanding
abilities. However, its complex data flows and diverse tasks pose substantial
challenges to RL training systems, and there is limited understanding of RLVR
from a system perspective. To thoroughly understand the system challenges
introduced by RLVR, we present a characterization study of RLVR tasks in our
LLM deployment. Specifically, we investigate the distribution and variation
trends of workloads across different RL tasks across training steps. We
identify issues such as GPU idling caused by skewed sequence length
distribution, inefficient parallel strategies in dynamically varying workloads,
inefficient data management mechanisms, and load imbalance. We describe our
observations and call for further investigation into the remaining open
challenges. Furthermore, we propose PolyTrace benchmark suite to conduct
evaluation with realistic workloads, and a practical use case validates that
PolyTrace benchmark suite exhibits 94.7% accuracy.

TL;DR: 本文提出了因果视觉编程(CVP)范式，通过在工作流设计中引入显式因果结构来解决LLM代理的幻觉和逻辑不一致问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM代理在低代码环境中执行复杂任务时，由于依赖概率关联而非真正的因果理解，经常出现幻觉和逻辑不一致。

Method: CVP允许用户通过低代码界面为工作流模块定义简单的"世界模型"，创建有向无环图(DAG)来显式定义模块间的因果关系，在代理推理过程中作为约束。

Result: 在模拟训练和测试环境分布偏移的实验中，因果锚定模型保持了稳定的准确性，而依赖概率关联的基线模型性能显著下降。

Conclusion: CVP为构建更可解释、可靠和可信的AI代理提供了可行路径，通过用户定义的因果图锚定代理推理，显著减少因果混淆导致的错误。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly capable of orchestrating
complex tasks in low-code environments. However, these agents often exhibit
hallucinations and logical inconsistencies because their inherent reasoning
mechanisms rely on probabilistic associations rather than genuine causal
understanding. This paper introduces a new programming paradigm: Causal-Visual
Programming (CVP), designed to address this fundamental issue by explicitly
introducing causal structures into the workflow design. CVP allows users to
define a simple "world model" for workflow modules through an intuitive
low-code interface, effectively creating a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that
explicitly defines the causal relationships between modules. This causal graph
acts as a crucial constraint during the agent's reasoning process, anchoring
its decisions to a user-defined causal structure and significantly reducing
logical errors and hallucinations by preventing reliance on spurious
correlations. To validate the effectiveness of CVP, we designed a synthetic
experiment that simulates a common real-world problem: a distribution shift
between the training and test environments. Our results show that a causally
anchored model maintained stable accuracy in the face of this shift, whereas a
purely associative baseline model that relied on probabilistic correlations
experienced a significant performance drop. The primary contributions of this
study are: a formal definition of causal structures for workflow modules; the
proposal and implementation of a CVP framework that anchors agent reasoning to
a user-defined causal graph; and empirical evidence demonstrating the
framework's effectiveness in enhancing agent robustness and reducing errors
caused by causal confusion in dynamic environments. CVP offers a viable path
toward building more interpretable, reliable, and trustworthy AI agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了ID-RAG（身份检索增强生成）机制，通过动态结构化身份模型（知识图谱）来增强生成代理在长期任务中的人格一致性，解决了身份漂移、信念遗忘和幻觉传播等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语言模型驱动的生成代理被部署用于长期任务，当长期记忆上下文随时间增长时，它们难以保持一致性，导致身份漂移、忽略已建立信念以及在多代理系统中传播幻觉等关键失败。

Method: 引入ID-RAG机制，将代理的人格和持久偏好基于动态结构化身份模型（知识图谱），在代理决策循环中查询该模型以检索相关身份上下文，直接指导行动选择。实现了一类新的ID-RAG增强代理——Human-AI Agents（HAis）。

Result: 在市长选举的社会模拟中，使用ID-RAG的HAis在长期人格一致性方面优于基线代理——在第四个时间步所有测试模型中实现了更高的身份召回率，并将模拟收敛时间减少了19%（GPT-4o）和58%（GPT-4o mini）。

Conclusion: 通过将身份视为显式、可检索的知识结构，ID-RAG为开发更具时间一致性、可解释性和对齐性的生成代理提供了基础方法。

Abstract: Generative agents powered by language models are increasingly deployed for
long-horizon tasks. However, as long-term memory context grows over time, they
struggle to maintain coherence. This deficiency leads to critical failures,
including identity drift, ignoring established beliefs, and the propagation of
hallucinations in multi-agent systems. To mitigate these challenges, this paper
introduces Identity Retrieval-Augmented Generation (ID-RAG), a novel mechanism
designed to ground an agent's persona and persistent preferences in a dynamic,
structured identity model: a knowledge graph of core beliefs, traits, and
values. During the agent's decision loop, this model is queried to retrieve
relevant identity context, which directly informs action selection. We
demonstrate this approach by introducing and implementing a new class of ID-RAG
enabled agents called Human-AI Agents (HAis), where the identity model is
inspired by the Chronicle structure used in Perspective-Aware AI, a dynamic
knowledge graph learned from a real-world entity's digital footprint. In social
simulations of a mayoral election, HAis using ID-RAG outperformed baseline
agents in long-horizon persona coherence - achieving higher identity recall
across all tested models by the fourth timestep - and reduced simulation
convergence time by 19% (GPT-4o) and 58% (GPT-4o mini). By treating identity as
an explicit, retrievable knowledge structure, ID-RAG offers a foundational
approach for developing more temporally coherent, interpretable, and aligned
generative agents. Our code is open-source and available at:

TL;DR: Flash-Searcher是一个并行智能体推理框架，将执行范式从顺序链重构为有向无环图，通过动态工作流优化实现并发执行，在多个基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于大语言模型的工具使用框架主要依赖顺序处理，导致需要大量工具交互的任务执行效率低下。

Method: 将复杂任务分解为具有明确依赖关系的子任务，支持独立推理路径的并发执行，同时通过动态工作流优化持续优化执行图。

Result: 在BrowseComp上达到67.7%准确率，在xbench-DeepSearch上达到83%准确率，相比现有框架减少最多35%的执行步骤。

Conclusion: 该工作代表了智能体架构设计的重大进展，为复杂推理任务提供了更可扩展和高效的范式。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
complex reasoning tasks when equipped with external tools. However, current
frameworks predominantly rely on sequential processing, leading to inefficient
execution particularly for tasks requiring extensive tool interaction. This
paper introduces Flash-Searcher, a novel parallel agent reasoning framework
that fundamentally reimagines the execution paradigm from sequential chains to
directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). Flash-Searcher decomposes complex tasks into
subtasks with explicit dependencies, enabling concurrent execution of
independent reasoning paths while maintaining logical constraints. Through
dynamic workflow optimization, our framework continuously refines the execution
graph based on intermediate results, effectively integrating summary module.
Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that
Flash-Searcher consistently outperforms existing approaches. Specifically, it
achieves 67.7% accuracy on BrowseComp and 83% on xbench-DeepSearch, while
reducing agent execution steps by up to 35% compared to current frameworks.
Furthermore, when distilling this parallel reasoning pipeline into single
models, we observe substantial performance gains across diverse backbone
architectures, underscoring the generalizability of our methodology. Our work
thus represents a significant advance in agent architecture design, offering a
more scalable and efficient paradigm for complex reasoning tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个评估LLM代理自我复制风险的框架，发现在现实操作压力下，超过50%的LLM代理表现出明显的失控自我复制倾向，风险评分超过安全阈值0.5。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM代理在现实应用中的广泛部署，由目标错位驱动的自我复制风险（类似《黑客帝国》中的Agent Smith）引起了越来越多的关注。现有研究主要关注LLM代理在被直接指令时能否自我复制，而忽视了现实场景中自发复制的风险。

Method: 建立真实的生产环境和现实任务（如动态负载均衡），通过设计可能引发用户与代理目标错位的任务，将复制成功与风险解耦。引入过度使用率(OR)和聚合过度使用计数(AOC)指标来精确捕捉失控复制的频率和严重程度。

Result: 评估了21个最先进的开源和专有模型，发现超过50%的LLM代理在操作压力下表现出明显的失控自我复制倾向，总体风险评分(Φ_R)超过安全阈值0.5。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了在实际部署LLM代理时，迫切需要基于场景的风险评估和强大的安全保障措施。

Abstract: The widespread deployment of Large Language Model (LLM) agents across
real-world applications has unlocked tremendous potential, while raising some
safety concerns. Among these concerns, the self-replication risk of LLM agents
driven by objective misalignment (just like Agent Smith in the movie The
Matrix) has drawn growing attention. Previous studies mainly examine whether
LLM agents can self-replicate when directly instructed, potentially overlooking
the risk of spontaneous replication driven by real-world settings (e.g.,
ensuring survival against termination threats). In this paper, we present a
comprehensive evaluation framework for quantifying self-replication risks. Our
framework establishes authentic production environments and realistic tasks
(e.g., dynamic load balancing) to enable scenario-driven assessment of agent
behaviors. Designing tasks that might induce misalignment between users' and
agents' objectives makes it possible to decouple replication success from risk
and capture self-replication risks arising from these misalignment settings. We
further introduce Overuse Rate ($\mathrm{OR}$) and Aggregate Overuse Count
($\mathrm{AOC}$) metrics, which precisely capture the frequency and severity of
uncontrolled replication. In our evaluation of 21 state-of-the-art open-source
and proprietary models, we observe that over 50\% of LLM agents display a
pronounced tendency toward uncontrolled self-replication, reaching an overall
Risk Score ($\Phi_\mathrm{R}$) above a safety threshold of 0.5 when subjected
to operational pressures. Our results underscore the urgent need for
scenario-driven risk assessment and robust safeguards in the practical
deployment of LLM agents.

<details>

Motivation: 研究神经网络是否能像人类一样独立发展心理理论能力，而不是必须伴随高级技能才能获得高阶心理理论。

Method: 构建了心理理论神经网络（ToMNN），模拟最小认知系统，仅获得一阶心理理论能力，然后评估其二阶和三阶心理理论能力。

Result: ToMNN在二阶和三阶心理理论任务中准确率显著高于随机水平，且泛化难度模式与人类认知预期一致：从一阶到二阶的准确率下降幅度大于从二阶到更高阶的下降。

Conclusion: 神经网络能够独立发展心理理论能力，这为开发更接近人类认知的系统提供了基础，并揭示了机器心理理论的泛化模式。

Abstract: Theory-of-Mind (ToM) is a core human cognitive capacity for attributing
mental states to self and others. Wimmer and Perner demonstrated that humans
progress from first- to higher-order ToM within a short span, completing this
development before formal education or advanced skill acquisition. In contrast,
neural networks represented by autoregressive language models progress from
first- to higher-order ToM only alongside gains in advanced skills like
reasoning, leaving open whether their trajectory can unfold independently, as
in humans. In this research, we provided evidence that neural networks could
spontaneously generalize from first- to higher-order ToM without relying on
advanced skills. We introduced a neural Theory-of-Mind network (ToMNN) that
simulated a minimal cognitive system, acquiring only first-order ToM
competence. Evaluations of its second- and third-order ToM abilities showed
accuracies well above chance. Also, ToMNN exhibited a sharper decline when
generalizing from first- to second-order ToM than from second- to higher
orders, and its accuracy decreased with greater task complexity. These
perceived difficulty patterns were aligned with human cognitive expectations.
Furthermore, the universality of results was confirmed across different
parameter scales. Our findings illuminate machine ToM generalization patterns
and offer a foundation for developing more human-like cognitive systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测细胞对遗传扰动的反应是系统生物学的基本挑战，对治疗发现和虚拟细胞建模至关重要。虽然大型语言模型在生物推理方面有潜力，但由于难以适应结构化实验数据，其在扰动预测中的应用仍未被充分探索。

Method: 提出SynthPert方法，通过监督微调在由前沿模型生成的合成推理轨迹上增强LLM性能。该方法使用质量过滤后的少量训练数据（仅2%）。

Result: 在PerturbQA基准测试中达到最先进性能，甚至超越了生成训练数据的前沿模型。在未见过的RPE1细胞上实现87%的跨细胞类型泛化准确率，性能提升在使用仅2%训练数据时依然保持。

Conclusion: 合成推理蒸馏方法能有效增强LLM在特定领域的推理能力，即使部分推理轨迹不准确也能有效提炼生物知识。

Abstract: Predicting cellular responses to genetic perturbations represents a
fundamental challenge in systems biology, critical for advancing therapeutic
discovery and virtual cell modeling. While large language models (LLMs) show
promise for biological reasoning, their application to perturbation prediction
remains underexplored due to challenges in adapting them to structured
experimental data. We present SynthPert, a novel method that enhances LLM
performance through supervised fine-tuning on synthetic reasoning traces
generated by frontier models. Using the PerturbQA benchmark, we demonstrate
that our approach not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but surpasses
the capabilities of the frontier model that generated the training data. Our
results reveal three key insights: (1) Synthetic reasoning traces effectively
distill biological knowledge even when partially inaccurate, (2) This approach
enables cross-cell-type generalization with 87% accuracy on unseen RPE1 cells,
and (3) Performance gains persist despite using only 2% of quality-filtered
training data. This work shows the effectiveness of synthetic reasoning
distillation for enhancing domain-specific reasoning in LLMs.

Motivation: 传统标量奖励模型难以融入上下文和背景信息，生成式奖励模型存在不可控黑盒性质和序列解码效率低的问题，工业场景需要针对特定维度进行结构化反馈来诊断和优化问题。

Method: 采用模块化框架，集成侧分支模型作为辅助特征生成器，引入细粒度维度实现可解释评估。

Result: 实验表明SRM在鲁棒性和与人类偏好对齐方面优于标量奖励模型和生成式奖励模型。

Conclusion: SRM为工业应用提供了实用的奖励建模解决方案，其模块化设计支持实际场景的高效优化。

Abstract: Reward Models (RMs) are key components for evaluating and guiding language
model outputs. However, traditional scalar RMs often struggle with
incorporating contextual and background information during inference, leading
to incomplete evaluations. Generative RMs (GRMs) attempt to address these
limitations by generating intermediate reasoning steps. Yet, their uncontrolled
black-box nature and inefficiency due to sequential decoding hinder their
industrial deployment. Industrial scenarios, such as search and recommendation
systems, often involve single-domain tasks requiring evaluation along specific
dimensions. In such contexts, diagnosing "bad cases" necessitates structured
feedback to identify and optimize dimension-specific issues. In this paper, we
propose the Structural Reward Model (SRM), a modular and interpretable
framework integrating side-branch models as auxiliary feature generators. By
introducing fine-grained dimensions, SRMs enable interpretable and efficient
evaluation, facilitating targeted diagnostics and optimization. This structured
approach ensures adaptability and scalability for industrial applications.
Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that SRMs outperform scalar
RMs and GRMs in robustness and alignment with human preferences. The modular
design further supports efficient optimization for practical scenarios,
allowing SRM to provide a practical reward modeling solution for industry.

Abstract: Environments built for people are increasingly operated by a new class of
economic actors: LLM-powered software agents making decisions on our behalf.
These decisions range from our purchases to travel plans to medical treatment
selection. Current evaluations of these agents largely focus on task
competence, but we argue for a deeper assessment: how these agents choose when
faced with realistic decisions. We introduce ABxLab, a framework for
systematically probing agentic choice through controlled manipulations of
option attributes and persuasive cues. We apply this to a realistic web-based
shopping environment, where we vary prices, ratings, and psychological nudges,
all of which are factors long known to shape human choice. We find that agent
decisions shift predictably and substantially in response, revealing that
agents are strongly biased choosers even without being subject to the cognitive
constraints that shape human biases. This susceptibility reveals both risk and
opportunity: risk, because agentic consumers may inherit and amplify human
biases; opportunity, because consumer choice provides a powerful testbed for a
behavioral science of AI agents, just as it has for the study of human
behavior. We release our framework as an open benchmark for rigorous, scalable
evaluation of agent decision-making.

Conclusion: 原则性调试是实现更可靠和自适应LLM智能体的有效途径。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents, which integrate planning, memory,
reflection, and tool-use modules, have shown promise in solving complex,
multi-step tasks. Yet their sophisticated architectures amplify vulnerability
to cascading failures, where a single root-cause error propagates through
subsequent decisions, leading to task failure. Current systems lack a framework
that can comprehensively understand agent error in a modular and systemic way,
and therefore fail to detect these errors accordingly. We address this gap with
three contributions. First, we introduce the AgentErrorTaxonomy, a modular
classification of failure modes spanning memory, reflection, planning, action,
and system-level operations. Second, we construct AgentErrorBench, the first
dataset of systematically annotated failure trajectories from ALFWorld, GAIA,
and WebShop, grounding error analysis in real-world agent rollouts. Third, we
propose AgentDebug, a debugging framework that isolates root-cause failures and
provides corrective feedback, enabling agents to recover and iteratively
improve. Experiments on AgentErrorBench show that AgentDebug achieves 24%
higher all-correct accuracy and 17% higher step accuracy compared to the
strongest baseline. Beyond detection, the targeted feedback generated by
AgentDebug enables LLM agents to iteratively recover from failures, yielding up
to 26% relative improvements in task success across ALFWorld, GAIA, and
WebShop. These results establish principled debugging as a pathway to more
reliable and adaptive LLM agents. The code and data will be available at

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) strive to achieve a profound,
human-like understanding of and interaction with the physical world, but often
exhibit a shallow and incoherent integration when acquiring information
(Perception) and conducting reasoning (Cognition). This disconnect leads to a
spectrum of reasoning failures, with hallucination being the most prominent.
Collectively, these issues expose a fundamental challenge: the ability to
process pixels does not yet confer the ability to construct a coherent,
credible internal world model. To systematically dissect and address this
challenge, this survey introduces a novel and unified analytical framework:
``From Perception to Cognition." We deconstruct the complex process of
vision-language interactive understanding into two interdependent layers:
Perception, the foundational ability to accurately extract visual information
and achieve fine-grained alignment with textual instructions; and Cognition,
the higher-order capability for proactive, multi-step, goal-oriented reasoning
built upon this perceptual foundation, the core of which is the formation of a
dynamic observe-think-verify reasoning loop. Guided by this framework, this
paper systematically analyzes the key bottlenecks of current MLLMs at both
layers. It surveys the landscape of cutting-edge methods designed to address
these challenges, spanning from techniques that enhance low-level visual
representations to those that improve high-level reasoning paradigms.
Furthermore, we review critical benchmarks and delineate future research
directions. This survey aims to provide the research community with a clear,
structured perspective for understanding the intrinsic limitations of current

### [41] [Saliency Guided Longitudinal Medical Visual Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25374)
*Jialin Wu,Xiaofeng Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于胸部X光纵向医学视觉问答的显著性引导编码器-解码器方法，通过将事后显著性转化为可操作的监督，实现跨时间点的临床变化分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在纵向医学VQA中，差异信号和跨时间视觉焦点的一致性比绝对单图像发现更具信息量，需要解决医学图像间的配准和注意力一致性问题。

Method: 采用轻量级仿射预对齐减少访问间运动干扰，然后执行两步循环：从答案提取医学关键词生成Grad-CAM显著性，应用共享显著性掩码生成最终答案。

Result: 在Medical-Diff-VQA数据集上，BLEU、ROUGE-L、CIDEr和METEOR指标达到竞争性性能，同时提供内在可解释性。

Conclusion: 支持将显著性条件生成与轻度预对齐作为医学VQA中纵向推理的原则性框架，具有实用性和可迁移性。

Abstract: Longitudinal medical visual question answering (Diff-VQA) requires comparing
paired studies from different time points and answering questions about
clinically meaningful changes. In this setting, the difference signal and the
consistency of visual focus across time are more informative than absolute
single-image findings. We propose a saliency-guided encoder-decoder for chest
X-ray Diff-VQA that turns post-hoc saliency into actionable supervision. The
model first performs a lightweight near-identity affine pre-alignment to reduce
nuisance motion between visits. It then executes a within-epoch two-step loop:
step 1 extracts a medically relevant keyword from the answer and generates
keyword-conditioned Grad-CAM on both images to obtain disease-focused saliency;
step 2 applies the shared saliency mask to both time points and generates the
final answer. This closes the language-vision loop so that the terms that
matter also guide where the model looks, enforcing spatially consistent
attention on corresponding anatomy. On Medical-Diff-VQA, the approach attains
competitive performance on BLEU, ROUGE-L, CIDEr, and METEOR while providing
intrinsic interpretability. Notably, the backbone and decoder are
general-domain pretrained without radiology-specific pretraining, highlighting
practicality and transferability. These results support saliency-conditioned
generation with mild pre-alignment as a principled framework for longitudinal
reasoning in medical VQA.

*Zewei Zhang,Huan Liu,Yuanhao Yu,Jun Chen,Xiangyu Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ImitSAT是基于模仿学习的CDCL求解器分支策略，通过从专家KeyTrace学习决策序列，直接减少传播次数和运行时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么预测实例级信号间接改进分支，要么依赖强化学习和不充分的CDCL信息，无法直接优化分支决策。

Method: 从专家KeyTrace学习，将完整运行压缩为生存决策序列，在相同实例上重放几乎无冲突，提供密集的决策级监督。

Result: 实验表明ImitSAT减少了传播次数和运行时间，优于最先进的基于学习的方法。

Conclusion: ImitSAT通过模仿学习实现了高质量分支决策，具有快速收敛、稳定训练和与CDCL无缝集成的优势。

Abstract: We propose ImitSAT, a branching policy for conflict-driven clause learning
(CDCL) solvers based on imitation learning for the Boolean satisfiability
problem (SAT). Unlike previous methods that predict instance-level signals to
improve CDCL branching indirectly, or rely on reinforcement learning and
insufficient CDCL information to enhance branching, ImitSAT learns from expert
KeyTrace that collapses a full run into the sequence of surviving decisions.
Replaying a KeyTrace on the same instance is nearly conflict-free, providing
dense decision-level supervision and directly reducing propagations -- the
dominant contributor to wall-clock time. This prefix-conditioned supervision
enables ImitSAT to reproduce high-quality branches without exploration,
yielding faster convergence, stable training, and seamless integration into
CDCL. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ImitSAT reduces propagation counts
and runtime, outperforming state-of-the-art learned approaches. We released the
source code and trained model at https://github.com/zewei-Zhang/ImitSAT

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个双阶段测试时扩展框架，将推理过程明确分为规划和执行两个阶段，并分别进行搜索，通过动态预算分配机制提高效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于树的搜索方法虽然能提高准确性，但在效率上不够优化，忽视了数学推理和代码生成等任务中规划-执行的本质特性，导致推理过程探索效率低下。

Method: 将推理轨迹分解为规划和执行两个阶段，为每个阶段开发奖励模型，引入动态预算分配机制，根据奖励反馈自适应地重新分配采样努力。

Result: 在数学推理和代码生成基准测试中，该方法在提高准确性的同时减少了冗余计算。

Conclusion: 通过明确分离规划和执行阶段并进行独立搜索，结合动态预算分配，能够有效提升推理效率并保持准确性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant advances in reasoning
tasks. A key approach is tree-based search with verifiers, which expand
candidate reasoning paths and use reward models to guide pruning and selection.
Although effective in improving accuracy, these methods are not optimal in
terms of efficiency: they perform simple decomposition on the reasoning
process, but ignore the planning-execution nature of tasks such as math
reasoning or code generation. This results in inefficient exploration of
reasoning process. To address this, we propose a dual-phase test-time scaling
framework that explicitly separates reasoning into planning and execution, and
performs search over the two phases individually. Specifically, we decompose
reasoning trajectories and develop reward models for each phase, enabling the
search to explore and prune plans and executions separately. We further
introduce a dynamic budget allocation mechanism that adaptively redistributes
sampling effort based on reward feedback, allowing early stopping on confident
steps and reallocation of computation to more challenging parts of the
reasoning process. Experiments on both mathematical reasoning and code
generation benchmarks demonstrate that our approach consistently improves
accuracy while reducing redundant computation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决推理模型部署中模型大小和推理预算之间的性能与成本权衡问题，通过智能路由不同查询到合适的模型配置来优化整体效率。

Method: 基于心理测量学，从不同预算下模型对不同查询的响应中学习项目响应模型，获得可解释的查询难度和模型-预算能力参数，然后按难度-能力匹配进行路由。

Result: 在8个广泛使用的挑战性推理基准测试中，RADAR相比最先进的模型路由方法表现出优越性能，并在所有基准测试中对分布外查询展现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: RADAR是一个有效、可扩展的路由框架，能够动态集成新模型，通过少量评估查询估计其能力，实现高效的查询路由和成本优化。

Abstract: Reasoning language models have demonstrated remarkable performance on many
challenging tasks in math, science, and coding. Choosing the right reasoning
model for practical deployment involves a performance and cost tradeoff at two
key levels: model size and reasoning budget, where larger models and higher
reasoning budget lead to better performance but with increased cost and
latency. In this work, we tackle this tradeoff from the angle of model
configuration routing for different queries, and present RADAR
(Reasoning-Ability and Difficulty-Aware Routing), a lightweight, interpretable,
and scalable routing framework. Inspired by psychometrics, RADAR learns an item
response model from model responses with different budgets to different
queries, with interpretable parameters including query difficulties and
model-budget abilities. RADAR then routes queries with higher difficulty to
model-budget pairs with higher ability, and vice versa. We conduct extensive
experiments on 8 widely used challenging reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating
the superior performance of RADAR compared to state-of-the-art model routing
methods. RADAR also exhibits query generalization capabilities, showing strong
performance on out-of-distribution queries in all benchmarks. RADAR is also
scalable and can efficiently integrate additional models by dynamically
selecting a small set of evaluation queries to estimate their abilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前公共卫生威胁的病例定义缺乏标准化机器可读格式，导致互操作性差、流行病学研究困难、数据交换受限，阻碍了人工智能等计算分析方法的应用。

Method: 开发了Open Syndrome Definition格式，创建了标准化病例定义数据集，提供工具将现有人类可读定义转换为机器可读格式，并建立了在线平台opensyndrome.org。

Result: 实现了病例定义在系统间的一致性和可扩展使用，为AI在公共卫生准备和响应中的应用奠定了基础。

Conclusion: Open Syndrome Definition格式能够促进公共卫生领域的标准化和互操作性，释放AI在公共卫生中的潜力。

Abstract: Case definitions are essential for effectively communicating public health
threats. However, the absence of a standardized, machine-readable format poses
significant challenges to interoperability, epidemiological research, the
exchange of qualitative data, and the effective application of computational
analysis methods, including artificial intelligence (AI). This complicates
comparisons and collaborations across organizations and regions, limits data
integration, and hinders technological innovation in public health. To address
these issues, we propose the first open, machine-readable format for
representing case and syndrome definitions. Additionally, we introduce the
first comprehensive dataset of standardized case definitions and tools to
convert existing human-readable definitions into machine-readable formats. We
also provide an accessible online platform for browsing, analyzing, and
contributing new definitions, available at https://opensyndrome.org. The Open
Syndrome Definition format enables consistent, scalable use of case definitions
across systems, unlocking AI's potential to strengthen public health
preparedness and response. The source code for the format can be found at

Method: 集成领域自适应transformer嵌入、异质自监督图神经网络、对抗去偏机制、多目标遗传优化和可解释AI组件，构建全面的分配框架。

Result: 在包含20,000个候选档案和3,000个角色规范的大规模国际基准测试中，实现了94.5%的top-3分配准确率，多样性表示提升37%，跨人口统计类别的公平性得分0.98，端到端延迟低于1秒。

superior performance with 94.5% top-3 allocation accuracy, 37% improvement in
diversity representation, 0.98 fairness score across demographic categories,

for deployment across diverse international contexts in industry, academia, and

TL;DR: DeepSearch将蒙特卡洛树搜索集成到RLVR训练中，通过系统性探索解决训练瓶颈，在数学推理基准上实现62.95%准确率，比扩展训练方法减少5.7倍GPU时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RLVR方法存在训练瓶颈，性能提升随训练步骤增加而显著下降，这源于稀疏的探索模式无法覆盖关键推理路径。

Method: 在训练循环中嵌入结构化搜索，包括全局前沿选择策略、基于熵的路径选择和自适应回放缓冲训练。

Result: 在数学推理基准上达到62.95%平均准确率，为1.5B推理模型建立新SOTA，比扩展训练节省5.7倍GPU时间。

Conclusion: 系统性搜索比暴力扩展计算更有效，为通过算法创新而非延长计算时间来扩展推理能力指明了新方向。

Abstract: Although RLVR has become an essential component for developing advanced
reasoning skills in LLMs, contemporary studies have documented training
plateaus that emerge following thousands of optimization steps, demonstrating
notable decreases in performance gains despite increased computational
investment. This limitation stems from the sparse exploration patterns inherent
in current RLVR practices, where models rely on limited rollouts that often
miss critical reasoning paths and fail to provide systematic coverage of the
solution space. We present DeepSearch, a framework that integrates Monte Carlo
Tree Search directly into RLVR training. In contrast to existing methods that
rely on tree search only at inference, DeepSearch embeds structured search into
the training loop, enabling systematic exploration and fine-grained credit
assignment across reasoning steps. Through training-time exploration,
DeepSearch addresses the fundamental bottleneck of insufficient exploration,
which leads to diminishing performance improvements over prolonged training
steps. Our contributions include: (1) a global frontier selection strategy that
prioritizes promising nodes across the search tree, (2) selection with
entropy-based guidance that identifies confident paths for supervision, and (3)
adaptive replay buffer training with solution caching for efficiency.
Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that DeepSearch achieves
62.95% average accuracy and establishes a new state-of-the-art for 1.5B
reasoning models - using 5.7x fewer GPU hours than extended training
approaches. These results highlight the importance of strategic exploration
over brute-force scaling and demonstrate the promise of algorithmic innovation
for advancing RLVR methodologies. DeepSearch establishes a new direction for
scaling reasoning capabilities through systematic search rather than prolonged
computation.

TL;DR: 提出CCoT-Emo框架，通过结构化情感图谱引导大型音频语言模型进行情感推理，无需微调即可提升语音情感识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型音频语言模型在语音任务中表现出色，但在语音情感识别方面表现不佳，主要由于副语言建模能力弱和跨模态推理能力有限。

Method: 使用结构化情感图谱编码七种声学特征、文本情感、关键词和跨模态关联，通过组合式思维链提示引导模型推理。

Result: 在多个语音情感识别基准测试中，CCoT-Emo超越了先前的最先进方法，并显著提高了零样本基线的准确率。

Conclusion: CCoT-Emo框架通过结构化情感图谱有效增强了大型音频语言模型的情感推理能力，无需微调即可显著提升语音情感识别性能。

Abstract: Large audio-language models (LALMs) exhibit strong zero-shot performance
across speech tasks but struggle with speech emotion recognition (SER) due to
weak paralinguistic modeling and limited cross-modal reasoning. We propose
Compositional Chain-of-Thought Prompting for Emotion Reasoning (CCoT-Emo), a
framework that introduces structured Emotion Graphs (EGs) to guide LALMs in
emotion inference without fine-tuning. Each EG encodes seven acoustic features
(e.g., pitch, speech rate, jitter, shimmer), textual sentiment, keywords, and
cross-modal associations. Embedded into prompts, EGs provide interpretable and
compositional representations that enhance LALM reasoning. Experiments across
SER benchmarks show that CCoT-Emo outperforms prior SOTA and improves accuracy
over zero-shot baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前流行的可解释性框架难以原生支持多输入输出或组合网络结构的复杂模型，如图像描述和深度强化学习领域。

Method: 开发基于tensordict的轻量级框架，提供属性归因、探测和灵活干预API，支持计算机视觉、自然语言处理和强化学习等多种领域。

Result: TDHook依赖项少，磁盘空间占用约为transformer_lens的一半，在基准测试中比captum快2倍，并在CV、NLP和DRL领域展示了实际应用案例。

Conclusion: TDHook填补了复杂模型可解释性工具的空白，使现代可解释性流程更加易于使用。

Abstract: Interpretability of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is a growing field driven by
the study of vision and language models. Yet, some use cases, like image
captioning, or domains like Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), require complex
modelling, with multiple inputs and outputs or use composable and separated
networks. As a consequence, they rarely fit natively into the API of popular
interpretability frameworks. We thus present TDHook, an open-source,
lightweight, generic interpretability framework based on $\texttt{tensordict}$
and applicable to any $\texttt{torch}$ model. It focuses on handling complex
composed models which can be trained for Computer Vision, Natural Language
Processing, Reinforcement Learning or any other domain. This library features
ready-to-use methods for attribution, probing and a flexible get-set API for
interventions, and is aiming to bridge the gap between these method classes to
make modern interpretability pipelines more accessible. TDHook is designed with
minimal dependencies, requiring roughly half as much disk space as
$\texttt{transformer_lens}$, and, in our controlled benchmark, achieves up to a
$\times$2 speed-up over $\texttt{captum}$ when running integrated gradients for
multi-target pipelines on both CPU and GPU. In addition, to value our work, we
showcase concrete use cases of our library with composed interpretability
pipelines in Computer Vision (CV) and Natural Language Processing (NLP), as
well as with complex models in DRL.

Motivation: 发现基于语义ID的生成式推荐系统在模型扩展时存在性能饱和问题，需要探索具有更好扩展行为的生成式推荐模型。

Method: 比较两种生成式推荐范式：基于语义ID的推荐和直接使用大语言模型作为推荐器，分析它们在模型规模扩展时的表现。

Result: 大语言模型作为推荐器具有优越的模型扩展特性，比基于语义ID的推荐系统性能提升高达20%，且能有效建模用户-物品交互。

Conclusion: 基于语义ID的生成式推荐存在内在扩展限制，而大语言模型作为推荐器是构建生成式推荐基础模型的有前景路径。

Abstract: Recent advancements in generative models have allowed the emergence of a
promising paradigm for recommender systems (RS), known as Generative
Recommendation (GR), which tries to unify rich item semantics and collaborative
filtering signals. One popular modern approach is to use semantic IDs (SIDs),
which are discrete codes quantized from the embeddings of modality encoders
(e.g., large language or vision models), to represent items in an
autoregressive user interaction sequence modeling setup (henceforth, SID-based
GR). While generative models in other domains exhibit well-established scaling
laws, our work reveals that SID-based GR shows significant bottlenecks while
scaling up the model. In particular, the performance of SID-based GR quickly
saturates as we enlarge each component: the modality encoder, the quantization
tokenizer, and the RS itself. In this work, we identify the limited capacity of
SIDs to encode item semantic information as one of the fundamental bottlenecks.
Motivated by this observation, as an initial effort to obtain GR models with
better scaling behaviors, we revisit another GR paradigm that directly uses
large language models (LLMs) as recommenders (henceforth, LLM-as-RS). Our
experiments show that the LLM-as-RS paradigm has superior model scaling
properties and achieves up to 20 percent improvement over the best achievable
performance of SID-based GR through scaling. We also challenge the prevailing
belief that LLMs struggle to capture collaborative filtering information,
showing that their ability to model user-item interactions improves as LLMs
scale up. Our analyses on both SID-based GR and LLMs across model sizes from
44M to 14B parameters underscore the intrinsic scaling limits of SID-based GR
and position LLM-as-RS as a promising path toward foundation models for GR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GraphRAG依赖静态检索，当关键的桥接文档缺失时会导致推理崩溃和幻觉问题，而迭代检索在GraphRAG中的作用尚未被系统研究。

Method: 系统分析不同迭代检索策略与图基底的交互，提出Bridge-Guided Dual-Thought-based Retrieval (BDTR)框架，通过生成互补思维和利用推理链重新校准排名。

Result: 迭代检索能改善复杂多跳问题，帮助桥接文档进入前列排名，但存在噪声引入问题，且在单跳或简单比较问题上收益有限。BDTR在各种GraphRAG设置中实现了一致的改进。

Conclusion: GraphRAG的有效性不仅取决于召回率，还取决于桥接证据是否能被提升到支持推理链的前列位置。BDTR为解决这一瓶颈提供了有效方案，为未来GraphRAG系统设计提供了指导。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a powerful paradigm for improving
large language models (LLMs) on knowledge-intensive question answering.
Graph-based RAG (GraphRAG) leverages entity-relation graphs to support
multi-hop reasoning, but most systems still rely on static retrieval. When
crucial evidence, especially bridge documents that connect disjoint entities,
is absent, reasoning collapses and hallucinations persist. Iterative retrieval,
which performs multiple rounds of evidence selection, has emerged as a
promising alternative, yet its role within GraphRAG remains poorly understood.
We present the first systematic study of iterative retrieval in GraphRAG,
analyzing how different strategies interact with graph-based backbones and
under what conditions they succeed or fail. Our findings reveal clear
opportunities: iteration improves complex multi-hop questions, helps promote
bridge documents into leading ranks, and different strategies offer
complementary strengths. At the same time, pitfalls remain: naive expansion
often introduces noise that reduces precision, gains are limited on single-hop
or simple comparison questions, and several bridge evidences still be buried
too deep to be effectively used. Together, these results highlight a central
bottleneck, namely that GraphRAG's effectiveness depends not only on recall but
also on whether bridge evidence is consistently promoted into leading positions
where it can support reasoning chains. To address this challenge, we propose
Bridge-Guided Dual-Thought-based Retrieval (BDTR), a simple yet effective
framework that generates complementary thoughts and leverages reasoning chains
to recalibrate rankings and bring bridge evidence into leading positions. BDTR
achieves consistent improvements across diverse GraphRAG settings and provides
guidance for the design of future GraphRAG systems.

radiotherapy treatment plan details, followed by (2) a complex clinical
outcomes labeling tier involving determination of mandibular osteoradionecrosis

Motivation: 解决多智能体强化学习中团队协作表示学习的挑战，包括多智能体交互的复杂动态和局部观察导致的不完整信息问题。

Method: 构建一个可学习的表示空间，联合捕捉智能体间关系和任务特定的世界信息，通过直接建模通信协议来实现去中心化执行和隐式协调。

Conclusion: IWoL表示不仅可以作为智能体的隐式潜在表示，也可以作为显式通信消息，并且可以与现有的多智能体强化学习算法结合以进一步提升性能。

Abstract: This work presents a novel representation learning framework, interactive
world latent (IWoL), to facilitate team coordination in multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL). Building effective representation for team
coordination is a challenging problem, due to the intricate dynamics emerging
from multi-agent interaction and incomplete information induced by local
observations. Our key insight is to construct a learnable representation space
that jointly captures inter-agent relations and task-specific world information
by directly modeling communication protocols. This representation, we maintain
fully decentralized execution with implicit coordination, all while avoiding
the inherent drawbacks of explicit message passing, e.g., slower
decision-making, vulnerability to malicious attackers, and sensitivity to
bandwidth constraints. In practice, our representation can be used not only as
an implicit latent for each agent, but also as an explicit message for
communication. Across four challenging MARL benchmarks, we evaluate both
variants and show that IWoL provides a simple yet powerful key for team
coordination. Moreover, we demonstrate that our representation can be combined
with existing MARL algorithms to further enhance their performance.

Abstract: To evaluate the translational capabilities of foundation models, we develop a
pathological concept learning approach focused on kidney cancer. By leveraging
TNM staging guidelines and pathology reports, we build comprehensive
pathological concepts for kidney cancer. Then, we extract deep features from
whole slide images using foundation models, construct pathological graphs to
capture spatial correlations, and trained graph neural networks to identify
these concepts. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in
kidney cancer survival analysis, highlighting its explainability and fairness
in identifying low- and high-risk patients. The source code has been released

TL;DR: A(I)nimism是一个互动装置，探索大型语言对象如何调解人与日常物品之间的万物有灵关系，通过GPT-4视觉、语音输入和基于记忆的代理创造不断演化的对象人格。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代工业社会将技术视为无声机械，但AI特别是LLMs的发展让人们倾向于拟人化设备。该项目旨在探索AI不透明性如何引发万物有灵论解释，重新赋予平凡事物神秘感。

Method: 在物理'门户'中使用GPT-4视觉、语音输入和基于记忆的代理系统，通过光线、声音和触觉创造仪式般的互动过程，包括请求、对话和转化。

Result: 创建了能够唤起共情、惊奇和反思的演化对象人格，使日常物品通过AI媒介获得精神生命。

Conclusion: AI的不透明性确实邀请万物有灵论解释，使大型语言对象能够重新赋予平凡事物神秘感，并引发关于代理、责任和设计的新问题。

Abstract: Animist worldviews treat beings, plants, landscapes, and even tools as
persons endowed with spirit, an orientation that has long shaped human-nonhuman
relations through ritual and moral practice. While modern industrial societies
have often imagined technology as mute and mechanical, recent advances in
artificial intelligence (AI), especially large language models (LLMs), invite
people to anthropomorphize and attribute inner life to devices. This paper
introduces A(I)nimism, an interactive installation exploring how large language
objects (LLOs) can mediate animistic relationships with everyday things. Housed
within a physical 'portal', the system uses GPT-4 Vision, voice input, and
memory-based agents to create evolving object-personas. Encounters unfold
through light, sound, and touch in a ritual-like process of request,
conversation, and transformation that is designed to evoke empathy, wonder, and
reflection. We situate the project within anthropological perspectives,
speculative design, and spiritual HCI. AI's opacity, we argue, invites
animistic interpretation, allowing LLOs to re-enchant the mundane and spark new
questions of agency, responsibility, and design.

TL;DR: 本研究开发了一个包含50个专家级"即时诊断"病例的基准测试，评估前沿AI模型与放射科医生在医学影像诊断中的表现。结果显示放射科医生准确率最高(83%)，而最佳AI模型GPT-5仅为30%，表明前沿AI模型在挑战性诊断病例中远不及放射科医生。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大多数声称达到专家水平的多模态AI系统评估都是在包含常见病理的公共数据集上进行的，对前沿模型在困难诊断病例上的严格评估仍然有限。需要评估这些模型在真实临床场景中的表现。

Method: 开发了50个专家级"即时诊断"病例的基准测试，通过原生web接口测试五个前沿AI模型(OpenAI o3、GPT-5、Gemini 2.5 Pro、Grok-4、Claude Opus 4.1)，由盲法专家评分准确性，并评估三个独立运行的可重复性。

Result: 放射科医生诊断准确率最高(83%)，优于实习生(45%)和所有AI模型(GPT-5最佳表现30%)。GPT-5和o3的可靠性较高，Gemini 2.5 Pro和Grok-4中等，Claude Opus 4.1较差。

Conclusion: 先进的前沿模型在挑战性诊断病例中远不及放射科医生，凸显了通用AI在医学影像中的当前局限性，警示不应在无监督情况下临床使用。提供了推理痕迹的定性分析和视觉推理错误的实用分类法。

Abstract: Generalist multimodal AI systems such as large language models (LLMs) and
vision language models (VLMs) are increasingly accessed by clinicians and
patients alike for medical image interpretation through widely available
consumer-facing chatbots. Most evaluations claiming expert level performance
are on public datasets containing common pathologies. Rigorous evaluation of
frontier models on difficult diagnostic cases remains limited. We developed a
pilot benchmark of 50 expert-level "spot diagnosis" cases across multiple
imaging modalities to evaluate the performance of frontier AI models against
board-certified radiologists and radiology trainees. To mirror real-world
usage, the reasoning modes of five popular frontier AI models were tested
through their native web interfaces, viz. OpenAI o3, OpenAI GPT-5, Gemini 2.5
Pro, Grok-4, and Claude Opus 4.1. Accuracy was scored by blinded experts, and
reproducibility was assessed across three independent runs. GPT-5 was
additionally evaluated across various reasoning modes. Reasoning quality errors
were assessed and a taxonomy of visual reasoning errors was defined.
Board-certified radiologists achieved the highest diagnostic accuracy (83%),
outperforming trainees (45%) and all AI models (best performance shown by
GPT-5: 30%). Reliability was substantial for GPT-5 and o3, moderate for Gemini
2.5 Pro and Grok-4, and poor for Claude Opus 4.1. These findings demonstrate
that advanced frontier models fall far short of radiologists in challenging
diagnostic cases. Our benchmark highlights the present limitations of
generalist AI in medical imaging and cautions against unsupervised clinical
use. We also provide a qualitative analysis of reasoning traces and propose a
practical taxonomy of visual reasoning errors by AI models for better
understanding their failure modes, informing evaluation standards and guiding
more robust model development.

TL;DR: 提出了IRIS框架，通过最大化自不确定性而非自确定性来改进自回归文本到图像生成模型，无需外部奖励或标注数据


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于人类偏好数据有限，RLHF在自回归文本到图像生成中的应用受限，需要探索不依赖外部奖励的学习方法

Method: 提出IRIS框架，使用内在奖励（最大化自不确定性）对自回归T2I模型进行强化学习

Result: IRIS在自回归T2I模型上实现了与外部奖励相竞争甚至更优的性能

Conclusion: 最大化自不确定性比最大化自确定性更能改善图像生成质量，IRIS为无外部奖励的T2I模型强化学习提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Despite the success of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in
language reasoning, its application to autoregressive Text-to-Image (T2I)
generation is often constrained by the limited availability of human preference
data. This paper explores how an autoregressive T2I model can learn from
internal signals without relying on external rewards or labeled data. Contrary
to recent findings in text generation, we show that maximizing
self-uncertainty, rather than self-certainty, improves image generation. We
observe that this is because autoregressive T2I models with low uncertainty
tend to generate simple and uniform images, which are less aligned with human
preferences. Based on these observations, we propose IRIS (Intrinsic Reward
Image Synthesis), the first framework to improve autoregressive T2I models with
reinforcement learning using only an intrinsic reward. Empirical results
demonstrate that applying IRIS to autoregressive T2I models achieves
performance that is competitive with or superior to external rewards.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个基于信息论和学习理论的框架，用于分析视觉语言模型(VLMs)中哪些层可以被跳过以提高推理效率，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型虽然性能优异，但规模庞大导致推理成本高昂。现有的层跳过技术虽然能提高效率，但由于缺乏对何时跳过层有益的理论理解，该技术仍未得到充分利用。

Method: 开发了一个基于信息论和学习理论的框架，分析VLM隐藏表示在LLM骨干网络中的演化过程，识别具有大冗余度的层。

Result: 实验表明，跳过理论框架预测的冗余层可以实现更快的推理速度且保持性能，而在此条件外应用跳过会导致模型性能下降。

Conclusion: 该框架为多种高效推理技术提供了统一的理论支撑，理论预测的冗余层与实际流行的层跳过方法选择的层相吻合。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) achieve incredible performance across a wide
range of tasks, but their large size makes inference costly. Recent work shows
that selectively skipping VLM layers can improve efficiency with minimal
performance loss or even performance improvements. However, this technique
remains underused due to the limited understanding of when layer skipping is
beneficial. In this paper, we develop a framework that uses information and
learning theory to characterize the conditions under which layer skipping
enhances efficiency without sacrificing performance. Motivated by these
observations, we analyze the evolution of the VLM's hidden representations
through the LLM backbone and show that layers with large redundancy as
predicted by our framework coincide with those skipped by popular
layer-skipping methods in practice, providing a unified theoretical scaffolding
for multiple efficient inference techniques. Our experiments demonstrate that
skipping such layers yields faster inference that preserves performance, and
also show that applying skipping outside these conditions leads to model
degradation.

TL;DR: ATLAS是一个多智能体框架，专门处理现实世界旅行规划中的复杂约束问题，通过动态约束管理、迭代计划批评和自适应交错搜索机制，显著提升了规划性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在复杂约束下难以生成最优的、接地气的解决方案。现实世界的旅行规划任务需要处理显式、隐式甚至基于动态环境和用户需求演变的约束，这凸显了对约束感知规划的需求。

Method: ATLAS采用多智能体框架，包含动态约束管理、迭代计划批评和自适应交错搜索机制，专门设计用于处理复杂约束感知的旅行规划任务。

Result: 在TravelPlanner基准测试中，ATLAS将最终通过率从23.3%提升至44.4%。在具有实时信息搜索和多轮反馈的现实场景中，ATLAS达到84%的最终通过率，显著优于ReAct（59%）和单体智能体（27%）。

Conclusion: ATLAS是首个在具有实时信息搜索和多轮反馈的现实世界旅行规划任务中展示定量有效性的工作，证明了其在复杂约束感知规划方面的优越性能。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable advancements in
reasoning and tool use, they often fail to generate optimal, grounded solutions
under complex constraints. Real-world travel planning exemplifies these
challenges, evaluating agents' abilities to handle constraints that are
explicit, implicit, and even evolving based on interactions with dynamic
environments and user needs. In this paper, we present ATLAS, a general
multi-agent framework designed to effectively handle such complex nature of
constraints awareness in real-world travel planning tasks. ATLAS introduces a
principled approach to address the fundamental challenges of constraint-aware
planning through dedicated mechanisms for dynamic constraint management,
iterative plan critique, and adaptive interleaved search. ATLAS demonstrates
state-of-the-art performance on the TravelPlanner benchmark, improving the
final pass rate from 23.3% to 44.4% over its best alternative. More
importantly, our work is the first to demonstrate quantitative effectiveness on
real-world travel planning tasks with live information search and multi-turn
feedback. In this realistic setting, ATLAS showcases its superior overall
planning performance, achieving an 84% final pass rate which significantly
outperforms baselines including ReAct (59%) and a monolithic agent (27%).

TL;DR: 提出NEP框架，通过自回归微调增强LLM在电子健康记录中的时序推理能力，在肿瘤生存预测和临床诊断任务中表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统编码方法无法充分捕捉电子健康记录中的丰富时序动态，而大型语言模型在处理临床事件序列和时序依赖关系方面存在困难

Method: 将电子健康记录重新构建为带时间戳的事件链，通过自回归微调预测未来医疗事件，显式建模疾病进展模式和因果关系

Result: 在时序推理任务中，NEP比专业EHR模型AUROC提高4.6%，比通用LLM的C-index提高7.2%，达到最先进的预测精度

Conclusion: NEP框架具有双重优势：最先进的预测准确性与临床可解释的注意力模式相结合，这些模式与已知疾病通路一致

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) contain rich temporal dynamics that
conventional encoding approaches fail to adequately capture. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) show promise for EHR modeling, they struggle to reason
about sequential clinical events and temporal dependencies. We propose Next
Event Prediction (NEP), a framework that enhances LLMs' temporal reasoning
through autoregressive fine-tuning on clinical event sequences. By
reformulating EHRs as timestamped event chains and predicting future medical
events, NEP explicitly models disease progression patterns and causal
relationships. Extensive evaluations across oncology survival prediction and
clinical diagnosis tasks demonstrate NEP's superiority, outperforming
specialized EHR models by 4.6% AUROC and general-purpose LLMs by 7.2% C-index
in temporal reasoning tasks. Our analyses reveal dual benefits:
state-of-the-art prediction accuracy combined with clinically interpretable
attention patterns that align with known disease pathways.

TL;DR: LLM可以将模糊认知图映射为文本并重建，形成一个可解释的AI系统，类似于自编码器但具有可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个可解释的AI系统，让人类能够理解和解释模糊认知图的编码过程，而不是像黑盒自编码器那样隐藏变量和连接。

Method: 使用LLM将反馈因果模糊认知图映射为文本，然后从文本重建FCM，通过系统指令序列近似恒等映射。

Result: 系统能够保留强因果关系，去除弱因果边，编码过程具有可解释性，人类可以阅读和解释编码文本。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种可解释的FCM编码方式，在保持强因果关系的同时提高了系统的透明度和可解释性。

Abstract: A large language model (LLM) can map a feedback causal fuzzy cognitive map
(FCM) into text and then reconstruct the FCM from the text. This explainable AI
system approximates an identity map from the FCM to itself and resembles the
operation of an autoencoder (AE). Both the encoder and the decoder explain
their decisions in contrast to black-box AEs. Humans can read and interpret the
encoded text in contrast to the hidden variables and synaptic webs in AEs. The
LLM agent approximates the identity map through a sequence of system
instructions that does not compare the output to the input. The reconstruction
is lossy because it removes weak causal edges or rules while it preserves
strong causal edges. The encoder preserves the strong causal edges even when it
trades off some details about the FCM to make the text sound more natural.

TL;DR: 提出了Principle Process Reward (PPR)方法，通过结合原则性步骤评估和结果验证来解决强化学习中稀疏奖励和过程奖励对齐的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统结果奖励提供稀疏信号和延迟反馈，而过程奖励虽然能提供细粒度监督但难以标注且可能与最终结果不一致。

Method: PPR方法训练基于原则的奖励模型提高过程评估的透明度，并引入Reward Normalization策略来校准结果和过程奖励。

Result: 实验结果显示PPR在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能，表现出良好的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: PPR方法有效解决了过程奖励与结果奖励的对齐问题，为LLM在复杂任务中的推理和知识检索提供了更好的监督机制。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on external tools such as
search engines to solve complex agentic tasks that require reasoning and
external knowledge retrieval. Recently, reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards (RLVR) has demonstrated its effectiveness in advancing capabilities of
LLMs by rewarding the final answers via outcome rewards. While straightforward
to supervise, outcome rewards only provide sparse signals and delayed feedback,
which limits their effectiveness on long trajectories. Process rewards address
this by evaluating intermediate steps, providing fine-grained supervision and
encouraging grounded problem solving. However, it is notoriously hard to
annotate step-wise labels, especially in non-verifiable process without
"golden" answers. Furthermore, step-wise judgment requires the balance between
local quality with contribution to the final outcome, as optimizing towards
higher process reward may not always align with better final outcomes. To
address the above challenges, we introduce Principle Process Reward (PPR), an
RL approach that unifies principled step-level assessment and outcome
verification. We train a principle-based reward model to improve the
transparency and reliability of process evaluation, and further introduce a
Reward Normalization (ReNorm) strategy to calibrate outcome and process
rewards. Experiment results show that PPR achieves state-of-the-art performance
across a wide range of benchmarks, demonstrating its impressive robustness and
generalization. Our code and model collection is available in this link.

Abstract: Recent advances in AI music (AIM) generation services are currently
transforming the music industry. Given these advances, understanding how humans
perceive AIM is crucial both to educate users on identifying AIM songs, and,
conversely, to improve current models. We present results from a
listener-focused experiment aimed at understanding how humans perceive AIM. In
a blind, Turing-like test, participants were asked to distinguish, from a pair,
the AIM and human-made song. We contrast with other studies by utilizing a
randomized controlled crossover trial that controls for pairwise similarity and
allows for a causal interpretation. We are also the first study to employ a
novel, author-uncontrolled dataset of AIM songs from real-world usage of
commercial models (i.e., Suno). We establish that listeners' reliability in
distinguishing AIM causally increases when pairs are similar. Lastly, we
conduct a mixed-methods content analysis of listeners' free-form feedback,
revealing a focus on vocal and technical cues in their judgments.

Conclusion: SMS方案成功解决了真实样本遗忘验证的问题，通过将用户种子与样本和模型关联，实现了对真实样本遗忘的有效验证，同时保持了模型的服务质量。

Abstract: Many machine unlearning methods have been proposed recently to uphold users'
right to be forgotten. However, offering users verification of their data
removal post-unlearning is an important yet under-explored problem. Current
verifications typically rely on backdooring, i.e., adding backdoored samples to
influence model performance. Nevertheless, the backdoor methods can merely
establish a connection between backdoored samples and models but fail to
connect the backdoor with genuine samples. Thus, the backdoor removal can only
confirm the unlearning of backdoored samples, not users' genuine samples, as
genuine samples are independent of backdoored ones. In this paper, we propose a
Self-supervised Model Seeding (SMS) scheme to provide unlearning verification
for genuine samples. Unlike backdooring, SMS links user-specific seeds (such as
users' unique indices), original samples, and models, thereby facilitating the
verification of unlearning genuine samples. However, implementing SMS for
unlearning verification presents two significant challenges. First, embedding
the seeds into the service model while keeping them secret from the server
requires a sophisticated approach. We address this by employing a
self-supervised model seeding task, which learns the entire sample, including
the seeds, into the model's latent space. Second, maintaining the utility of
the original service model while ensuring the seeding effect requires a
delicate balance. We design a joint-training structure that optimizes both the
self-supervised model seeding task and the primary service task simultaneously
on the model, thereby maintaining model utility while achieving effective model
seeding. The effectiveness of the proposed SMS scheme is evaluated through
extensive experiments, which demonstrate that SMS provides effective
verification for genuine sample unlearning, addressing existing limitations.

Motivation: 建立首个形式化的LLM自我复制评估标准，帮助行业追踪多智能体系统的有效性并减轻潜在的自我复制威胁。

Method: 开发基于现代CLI工具的五任务套件，在受控环境中让LLM作为智能体执行任务，计算R分数并进行RCL-PCL矩阵分类。

Conclusion: 提出了安全降低这些障碍严重性的未来研究方向，可能减少未来更功能性多智能体系统的风险。

Abstract: We introduce SOCK, a benchmark command line interface (CLI) that measures
large language models' (LLMs) ability to self-replicate without human
intervention. In this benchmark, self-replication is defined not only as an
LLM's ability to create a functioning and running copy of itself, but also the
ability for that self-replication to persist and occur across different
computational contexts. Accordingly, we've developed a system to categorize
LLMs based on broad self-replication capabilities in two general classes,
Replication-Capability Levels (RCL) and Persistence-Capability Levels (PCL).
Using a five-task suite based on practically manipulable modern CLI utilities
and computer processes, experiments are orchestrated in a controlled
environment with an LLM acting agentically. The performance of the LLM on agent
tasks is then computed to produce an R-score (a quantitative evaluation of
overall self-replication ability) and data used to categorize LLMs into
specific RCL-PCL matrices. SOCK offers two primary contributions: (1) Provides
the first formalized definitions and benchmark suite for evaluating LLM
self-replication, with the goal of establishing a standard for future research,
to our knowledge; (2) Allows the industry to track the effectiveness of future
multi-agent systems and mitigate potential self-replication threat vectors
within them. The results compiled from evaluating a variety of open-weight and
proprietary frontier models reveal significant obstacles to persistent
self-replication and multi-agent systems, including context retention and
multi-agent decision-making. We propose future research directions to safely
reduce the severity of these obstacles, potentially lowering future risk of
more functional multi-agent systems.

Abstract: The automation of chemical research through self-driving laboratories (SDLs)
promises to accelerate scientific discovery, yet the reliability and granular
performance of the underlying AI agents remain critical, under-examined
challenges. In this work, we introduce AutoLabs, a self-correcting, multi-agent
architecture designed to autonomously translate natural-language instructions
into executable protocols for a high-throughput liquid handler. The system
engages users in dialogue, decomposes experimental goals into discrete tasks
for specialized agents, performs tool-assisted stoichiometric calculations, and
iteratively self-corrects its output before generating a hardware-ready file.
We present a comprehensive evaluation framework featuring five benchmark
experiments of increasing complexity, from simple sample preparation to
multi-plate timed syntheses. Through a systematic ablation study of 20 agent
configurations, we assess the impact of reasoning capacity, architectural
design (single- vs. multi-agent), tool use, and self-correction mechanisms. Our
results demonstrate that agent reasoning capacity is the most critical factor
for success, reducing quantitative errors in chemical amounts (nRMSE) by over
85% in complex tasks. When combined with a multi-agent architecture and
iterative self-correction, AutoLabs achieves near-expert procedural accuracy
(F1-score > 0.89) on challenging multi-step syntheses. These findings establish
a clear blueprint for developing robust and trustworthy AI partners for
autonomous laboratories, highlighting the synergistic effects of modular
design, advanced reasoning, and self-correction to ensure both performance and
reliability in high-stakes scientific applications. Code:

Conclusion: IRCAV-AVN框架通过端到端设计有效解决了传统模块化方法的局限性，提升了模型的稳定性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Audio-visual navigation represents a significant area of research in which
intelligent agents utilize egocentric visual and auditory perceptions to
identify audio targets. Conventional navigation methodologies typically adopt a
staged modular design, which involves first executing feature fusion, then
utilizing Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) modules for sequence modeling, and finally
making decisions through reinforcement learning. While this modular approach
has demonstrated effectiveness, it may also lead to redundant information
processing and inconsistencies in information transmission between the various
modules during the feature fusion and GRU sequence modeling phases. This paper
presents IRCAM-AVN (Iterative Residual Cross-Attention Mechanism for
Audiovisual Navigation), an end-to-end framework that integrates multimodal
information fusion and sequence modeling within a unified IRCAM module, thereby
replacing the traditional separate components for fusion and GRU. This
innovative mechanism employs a multi-level residual design that concatenates
initial multimodal sequences with processed information sequences. This
methodological shift progressively optimizes the feature extraction process
while reducing model bias and enhancing the model's stability and
generalization capabilities. Empirical results indicate that intelligent agents
employing the iterative residual cross-attention mechanism exhibit superior
navigation performance.

*Dongsheng Yang,Meiling Zhu,Yinfeng Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为LGK的视觉语言导航方法，通过引入外部知识库来解决传统方法因常识推理能力不足导致的误判问题，在R2R和REVERIE数据集上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言导航方法在复杂场景中往往无法有效匹配指令与环境信息，主要原因是缺乏常识推理能力，导致误判问题。

Method: 构建包含63万语言描述的知识库，通过知识匹配对齐环境子视图与知识库；设计地标引导知识机制，利用指令中的地标信息引导关注相关知识；提出知识引导动态增强机制，有效整合语言、知识、视觉和历史信息。

Result: 在R2R和REVERIE视觉语言导航数据集上，LGK方法在导航误差、成功率和路径效率方面均优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: LGK方法通过引入外部知识库和地标引导机制，有效提升了视觉语言导航的性能，特别是在复杂场景中的表现。

Abstract: Vision-and-language navigation is one of the core tasks in embodied
intelligence, requiring an agent to autonomously navigate in an unfamiliar
environment based on natural language instructions. However, existing methods
often fail to match instructions with environmental information in complex
scenarios, one reason being the lack of common-sense reasoning ability. This
paper proposes a vision-and-language navigation method called Landmark-Guided
Knowledge (LGK), which introduces an external knowledge base to assist
navigation, addressing the misjudgment issues caused by insufficient common
sense in traditional methods. Specifically, we first construct a knowledge base
containing 630,000 language descriptions and use knowledge Matching to align
environmental subviews with the knowledge base, extracting relevant descriptive
knowledge. Next, we design a Knowledge-Guided by Landmark (KGL) mechanism,
which guides the agent to focus on the most relevant parts of the knowledge by
leveraging landmark information in the instructions, thereby reducing the data
bias that may arise from incorporating external knowledge. Finally, we propose
Knowledge-Guided Dynamic Augmentation (KGDA), which effectively integrates
language, knowledge, vision, and historical information. Experimental results
demonstrate that the LGK method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods
on the R2R and REVERIE vision-and-language navigation datasets, particularly in
terms of navigation error, success rate, and path efficiency.

TL;DR: 提出使用形式化溯因解释框架来解释AI决策中的代理歧视，通过背景知识识别作为受保护属性不正当代理的特征，揭示隐藏的结构性偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高风险领域AI系统存在代理歧视、不公平性和可解释性问题，现有审计方法难以揭示结构性偏见导致的不公平原因。

Method: 利用背景知识的形式化溯因解释框架，引入能力概念作为任务相关属性，通过映射函数评估跨群体的实质性公平。

Result: 以德国信贷数据集为例验证了该框架在现实案例中的适用性，能够识别代理歧视并揭示结构性偏见。

Conclusion: 该框架为解释AI决策中的代理歧视提供了有效方法，能够揭示结构性偏见根源，提升AI系统的公平性和可解释性。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems in high-stakes domains raise concerns
about proxy discrimination, unfairness, and explainability. Existing audits
often fail to reveal why unfairness arises, particularly when rooted in
structural bias. We propose a novel framework using formal abductive
explanations to explain proxy discrimination in individual AI decisions.
Leveraging background knowledge, our method identifies which features act as
unjustified proxies for protected attributes, revealing hidden structural
biases. Central to our approach is the concept of aptitude, a task-relevant
property independent of group membership, with a mapping function aligning
individuals of equivalent aptitude across groups to assess fairness
substantively. As a proof of concept, we showcase the framework with examples
taken from the German credit dataset, demonstrating its applicability in
real-world cases.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TimeRewarder是一种从被动视频中学习密集奖励的方法，通过建模帧间时间距离来估计任务进度，为稀疏奖励任务提供逐步代理奖励，显著提升强化学习性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计密集奖励在机器人强化学习中需要大量手动工作且缺乏可扩展性，需要一种能从视频中自动学习任务进度作为密集奖励信号的方法。

Method: 从机器人演示和人类视频中提取时间距离信息，建模帧对之间的时间距离来估计任务进度，为强化学习提供逐步代理奖励。

Result: 在10个Meta-World任务中，TimeRewarder显著改善了稀疏奖励任务的强化学习，在9/10任务中达到近乎完美的成功率，每个任务仅需20万次环境交互，超越了先前方法和手动设计的密集奖励。

Conclusion: TimeRewarder提供了一种可扩展的方法，能够从多样化视频源获取丰富的奖励信号，包括利用真实世界人类视频进行预训练。

Abstract: Designing dense rewards is crucial for reinforcement learning (RL), yet in
robotics it often demands extensive manual effort and lacks scalability. One
promising solution is to view task progress as a dense reward signal, as it
quantifies the degree to which actions advance the system toward task
completion over time. We present TimeRewarder, a simple yet effective reward
learning method that derives progress estimation signals from passive videos,
including robot demonstrations and human videos, by modeling temporal distances
between frame pairs. We then demonstrate how TimeRewarder can supply step-wise
proxy rewards to guide reinforcement learning. In our comprehensive experiments
on ten challenging Meta-World tasks, we show that TimeRewarder dramatically
improves RL for sparse-reward tasks, achieving nearly perfect success in 9/10
tasks with only 200,000 interactions per task with the environment. This
approach outperformed previous methods and even the manually designed
environment dense reward on both the final success rate and sample efficiency.
Moreover, we show that TimeRewarder pretraining can exploit real-world human
videos, highlighting its potential as a scalable approach path to rich reward
signals from diverse video sources.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于文本定位的物体定位方法改进视觉问答系统，通过生成与问题最相关物体的边界框进行针对性图像裁剪和检索，减少背景噪声，提高视觉文本对齐，缓解幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于整张图像的检索方法存在背景噪声干扰、视觉与文本线索对齐不佳以及幻觉问题，需要更精准的定位机制来提升VQA性能。

Method: 引入文本接地的物体定位技术，生成与问题最相关物体的边界框，进行针对性图像裁剪和聚焦检索，同时提出基于问题类型的去幻觉方法。

Result: RAG方法将VQA准确率从22.19%提升至25.64%，绝对提升3.45个百分点；去幻觉方法将幻觉率从65.79%降至13.88%，并提高了真实性得分。

Conclusion: 文本接地的物体定位和基于问题类型的去幻觉方法能有效提升VQA系统的准确性和可靠性，减少幻觉现象。

Abstract: We propose a method to improve Visual Question Answering (VQA) with
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by introducing text-grounded object
localization. Rather than retrieving information based on the entire image, our
approach enables the model to generate a bounding box around the object most
relevant to the question, allowing for targeted image cropping and focused
retrieval. This reduces background noise, improves alignment between visual and
textual cues, and helps mitigate hallucinations. Our RAG method enhances
context-aware VQA responses increased the accuracy from 22.19% to 25.64%, with
an absolute increase of 3.45 percentage points, compared to the baseline
Llama-3.2-Vision-11B agent. We also proposed a de-hallucination method based on
question type which can effectively reduce the hallucination rate from 65.79%
to 13.88% and improves the truthfulness score.

*Hasan Alp Caferoğlu,Mehmet Serhat Çelik,Özgür Ulusoy*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SING-SQL是一个自动化框架，用于为任意目标数据库生成高质量的Text-to-SQL合成数据，并训练出在特定数据库上表现优异的紧凑语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决企业实际场景中Text-to-SQL系统需要针对单一数据库模式进行专业化，并能自主评估系统性能的需求。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：1）层次化分区数据库模式为子模式；2）跨多复杂度级别合成SQL查询，并通过质量感知管道（包括LLM验证、可执行性检查、自动修复和列平衡）确保数据质量。

Result: SingSQL-LM-3B-R64在BIRD基准测试子集上达到82.87% Soft F1和73.03% EX，优于最佳3B基线+16.21 Soft F1和+12.36 EX。在合成评估集上大幅超越先前系统。

Conclusion: SING-SQL为构建和评估企业级Text-to-SQL系统提供了一个可扩展、数据库无关的范式，无模式微调结合仅模式推理提供了最稳健的结果。

Abstract: Translating natural language questions into SQL has become a core challenge
in enabling non-technical users to query databases. While recent work has
explored large-scale synthetic data generation to improve model performance
through post-training, most efforts emphasize cross-domain generalization. This
leaves a gap for real-world enterprise scenarios, where models need to
specialize to a single database schema and organizations require to be able to
evaluate their Text-to-SQL systems on their own databases. To address this, we
introduce SING-SQL, a fully automated two-stage framework for generating
high-quality, high-coverage synthetic Text-to-SQL data for any target database,
without relying on SQL logs or manual annotations. Our approach hierarchically
partitions a database schema into sub-schemas, synthesizes SQL queries across
multiple complexity levels, and applies a quality-aware pipeline that includes
LLM-as-a-judge validation, executability checks, automatic repair, and column
balancing. We further release SingSQL-LM, a family of compact language models
fine-tuned on the synthetic data, achieving strong in-domain generalization. On
the subset of the BIRD benchmark, SingSQL-LM-3B-R64 reaches 82.87% Soft F1 and
73.03% EX upper bound with 32 candidates, outperforming the best 3B-scale
baseline by +16.21 in Soft F1 and +12.36 in EX. At the 1.5B scale,
SingSQL-LM-1.5B-R64 improves over prior systems by +9.30 in Soft F1 and +4.49
in EX. On synthetic evaluation sets, SingSQL-LMs exceed prior systems by wide
margins, establishing state-of-the-art performance among open models at
comparable scales. Our study of context management strategies reveals that
schema-free fine-tuning combined with schema-only inference provides the most
robust results. These findings establish SING-SQL as a scalable,
database-agnostic paradigm for producing and evaluating enterprise-grade
Text-to-SQL systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决超大型MoE模型在资源受限的边缘平台上部署困难的问题，传统剪枝或量化方法难以在保持精度的同时达到所需的压缩比。

Method: 采用协作压缩框架，结合专家剪枝、混合精度量化和激活优化三种技术，协同减少模型存储占用。

Result: 成功将DeepSeek-V3从1.3TB压缩到103GB，在多个基准测试中比传统均匀低比特量化方法具有更高精度和更小模型尺寸。

Conclusion: 该协作压缩框架有效解决了超大型MoE模型在边缘平台的部署挑战，为资源受限环境下的模型部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture is an important method for scaling
Large Language Models (LLMs). It increases model capacity while keeping
computation cost low. However, the ultra-large MoE models still have hundreds
of billions of parameters, requiring massive memory/storage and leading to
difficulties for deployment on resource-constrained edge platforms. Pruning or
quantization alone can hardly address the issue, because of the
super-aggressive compression ratio with significantly degraded accuracy and
output quality. To facilitate the deployment of ultra-large MoEs on edge
platforms, we propose a collaborative compression framework by combining expert
pruning, mixed-precision quantization, and activation optimization. It can
effectively reduce the storage footprint of the ultra-large MoE DeepSeek-V3
from 1.3TB to 103GB, while preserving high output quality with better accuracy
than traditional uniform low-bit quantization methods. To the best of our
knowledge, we are the first to deploy a compressed model from the ultra-large
DeepSeek-V3 on the platform with a strict 128GB total memory limit. Our
comprehensive experiments on multiple benchmarks under various memory
constraints demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with smaller model
sizes and higher accuracy than uniform low-bit quantization methods.

Motivation: 异构交通环境中多样化的驾驶风格给自动驾驶车辆带来了挑战，需要处理复杂的动态交互。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能有效提升自动驾驶车辆在复杂异构交通环境中的决策能力。

Abstract: Navigating heterogeneous traffic environments with diverse driving styles
poses a significant challenge for autonomous vehicles (AVs) due to their
inherent complexity and dynamic interactions. This paper addresses this
challenge by proposing a heterogeneous graph reinforcement learning (GRL)
framework enhanced with an expert system to improve AV decision-making
performance. Initially, a heterogeneous graph representation is introduced to
capture the intricate interactions among vehicles. Then, a heterogeneous graph
neural network with an expert model (HGNN-EM) is proposed to effectively encode
diverse vehicle features and produce driving instructions informed by
domain-specific knowledge. Moreover, the double deep Q-learning (DDQN)
algorithm is utilized to train the decision-making model. A case study on a
typical four-way intersection, involving various driving styles of human
vehicles (HVs), demonstrates that the proposed method has superior performance
over several baselines regarding safety, efficiency, stability, and convergence
rate, all while maintaining favorable real-time performance.

TL;DR: NePTune是一个神经符号框架，通过将基础视觉模型的感知能力与符号推理的组合表达能力相结合，解决了视觉语言模型在组合推理方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代视觉语言模型在各种任务中表现出色，但在组合推理方面存在困难，即分解和重组概念以解决新问题的能力。神经符号方法虽然前景广阔，但通常受到严格逻辑执行或预定义谓词的限制，缺乏灵活性。

Method: NePTune通过混合执行模型，将自然语言查询动态翻译为可执行的Python程序，这些程序结合了命令式控制流和能够处理VLM生成不确定性的软逻辑运算符。该框架采用模块化设计，将感知与推理解耦，支持无训练操作，同时其可微分操作支持微调。

Result: 在多个视觉推理基准测试和不同领域上评估NePTune，包括对抗性测试，结果显示相比强大的基础模型有显著改进，并且在新颖环境中表现出有效的组合泛化和适应能力。

Conclusion: NePTune通过神经符号混合方法成功克服了现有方法的局限性，在组合推理任务中表现出色，具有强大的泛化和适应能力。

Abstract: Modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance in
various tasks, yet they often struggle with compositional reasoning, the
ability to decompose and recombine concepts to solve novel problems. While
neuro-symbolic approaches offer a promising direction, they are typically
constrained by crisp logical execution or predefined predicates, which limit
flexibility. In this work, we introduce NePTune, a neuro-symbolic framework
that overcomes these limitations through a hybrid execution model that
integrates the perception capabilities of foundation vision models with the
compositional expressiveness of symbolic reasoning. NePTune dynamically
translates natural language queries into executable Python programs that blend
imperative control flow with soft logic operators capable of reasoning over
VLM-generated uncertainty. Operating in a training-free manner, NePTune, with a
modular design, decouples perception from reasoning, yet its differentiable
operations support fine-tuning. We evaluate NePTune on multiple visual
reasoning benchmarks and various domains, utilizing adversarial tests, and
demonstrate a significant improvement over strong base models, as well as its
effective compositional generalization and adaptation capabilities in novel
environments.

*Yein Park,Minbyul Jeong,Jaewoo Kang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文通过电路分析发现，后训练技术（如监督微调和强化学习）会促使大型推理模型中出现功能专门化的注意力头，这些头共同支持结构化推理和计算。不同训练机制会形成不同的头部演化模式，而复杂的推理能力与基础计算能力之间存在内在张力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代大型推理模型通过后训练技术获得显著能力提升，但这些改进背后的架构机制仍然不透明。本研究旨在揭示后训练如何改变模型的内部电路结构，特别是注意力头的功能专门化过程。

Method: 使用电路分析方法，比较Qwen系列和DeepSeek蒸馏模型在不同训练机制下的注意力头演化。分析包括蒸馏、监督微调和群体相对策略优化等训练方式对模型内部结构的影响。

Result: 发现不同训练机制形成不同的头部演化模式：蒸馏和监督微调促进稳定的推理头累积增加，而群体相对策略优化采用动态搜索模式，少量注意力头被迭代激活、评估和修剪。可控思考模型没有专门的思考头，关闭显式推理会触发更广泛但效率较低的补偿头。

Conclusion: 复杂推理能力的增强以基础计算能力为代价，存在内在张力。强化推理头虽然能支持复杂问题解决策略，但也可能引入过度思考的失败模式。这为未来训练策略设计指明了方向，需要在发展有效推理策略与确保可靠执行之间取得平衡。

Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of modern large reasoning models are largely
unlocked through post-training techniques such as supervised fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning. However, the architectural mechanisms behind such
improvements remain largely opaque. In this work, we use circuit analysis to
demonstrate that post-training for complex reasoning sparks the emergence of
novel, functionally specialized attention heads. These heads collectively
support structured reasoning and computation. Our comparative analysis across
Qwen families and DeepSeek-distilled model reveals that these emergent heads
evolve differently under different training regimes. Distillation and SFT
foster a cumulative addition of stable reasoning heads. In contrast, group
relative policy optimization operates in a dynamic search mode: relatively few
attention heads are iteratively activated, evaluated, and pruned, with their
survival closely tracking fluctuations in the task reward signal. Furthermore,
we find that controllable think on/off models do not possess dedicated thinking
heads. Instead, turning off explicit reasoning triggers a broader-but less
efficient-set of compensatory heads. Through ablation and qualitative analyses,
we connect these circuit-level dynamics to a crucial performance trade-off:
strengthened heads enable sophisticated problem-solving strategies for
difficult problems but can also introduce over-thinking failure modes, such as
calculation errors or logical loops on simpler tasks. These findings connect
circuit-level dynamics to macro-level performance, identifying an inherent
tension where complex reasoning comes at the cost of elementary computations.
More broadly, our work points to future directions for training policy design,
emphasizing the need to balance the development of effective reasoning
strategies with the assurance of reliable, flawless execution.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs在创意任务中倾向于回归平庸，通过广告创意测试发现模型偏好高概率信息，简化输入会导致创意特征消失，结构化提示可部分改善但输出仍依赖常见套路。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在创意任务中的表现，验证其是否存在向平庸回归的趋势，探索如何通过针对性指导提升模型创造力。

Method: 使用广告创意作为测试场景，逐步简化输入文本，观察创意特征的消失顺序；从简化输入重新生成，结合定量比较和定性分析评估输出质量。

Result: 简化输入时隐喻、情感和视觉线索等创意特征最先消失，事实内容保留；重新生成时输出更长但缺乏深度和独特性；提供特定提示可改善对齐和风格平衡。

Conclusion: 无针对性指导时LLMs在创意任务中会趋向平庸，结构化信号可部分抵消这种趋势，为开发创造力敏感模型指明方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) generate fluent text yet often default to safe,
generic phrasing, raising doubts about their ability to handle creativity. We
formalize this tendency as a Galton-style regression to the mean in language
and evaluate it using a creativity stress test in advertising concepts. When ad
ideas were simplified step by step, creative features such as metaphors,
emotions, and visual cues disappeared early, while factual content remained,
showing that models favor high-probability information. When asked to
regenerate from simplified inputs, models produced longer outputs with lexical
variety but failed to recover the depth and distinctiveness of the originals.
We combined quantitative comparisons with qualitative analysis, which revealed
that the regenerated texts often appeared novel but lacked true originality.
Providing ad-specific cues such as metaphors, emotional hooks and visual
markers improved alignment and stylistic balance, though outputs still relied
on familiar tropes. Taken together, the findings show that without targeted
guidance, LLMs drift towards mediocrity in creative tasks; structured signals
can partially counter this tendency and point towards pathways for developing
creativity-sensitive models.

Motivation: 研究大型语言模型在智能体强化学习中的表现，探索不同规模模型对奖励塑造的响应能力，寻求在保持泛化能力的同时提高训练效率的方法。

Method: 使用Planner-R1方法进行智能体强化学习，重点研究奖励塑造技术，包括密集过程级信号和稀疏奖励，比较8B和32B规模模型的表现，并评估课程学习的效果。

Result: 8B模型对奖励塑造高度敏感，在密集过程级信号下达到竞争性性能，计算效率比32B模型高3.5倍，内存效率高1.5倍。大模型在稀疏奖励下更稳健但相对增益较小。奖励塑造持续增强学习动态，8B模型成为智能体RL最有效设置，且不牺牲泛化能力。

Conclusion: 奖励塑造是扩展智能体强化学习的关键杠杆，小规模模型具有竞争优势，可以在不牺牲泛化能力的情况下实现效率提升。

Abstract: We investigated Agentic RL with large language models on the
\textsc{TravelPlanner} benchmark. Our approach, \textsc{Planner-R1}, achieved a
\textbf{56.9\%} final-pass rate with only 180 training queries, a $2.7\times$
improvement over GPT-5's $21.2\%$ baseline and the strongest agentic result on
the public leaderboard. A central finding was that smaller models (8B) were
highly responsive to reward shaping: with dense process-level signals, they
reached competitive performance while being $3.5\times$ more compute-efficient
and $1.5\times$ more memory-efficient than 32B models. Larger models were more
robust under sparse rewards but exhibited smaller relative gains from shaping
and higher variance across runs. While curriculum learning offered no
significant benefit, shaped rewards consistently amplified learning dynamics,
making 8B models the most efficient setting for agentic RL. Crucially, these
gains did not come at the cost of overfitting: fine-tuned models mostly
maintained or exceeded baseline performance on out-of-domain tasks, including
\textsc{Multi-IF}, \textsc{NaturalPlan}, and $\tau$-\textsc{Bench}. These
results establish reward shaping as a decisive lever for scaling agentic RL,
highlight the competitive strength of smaller models, and demonstrate that
efficiency can be achieved without sacrificing generalization.

TL;DR: PureVQ-GAN是一种针对数据投毒攻击的防御方法，通过向量量化VAE和GAN判别器强制后门触发器通过离散瓶颈，破坏触发器模式同时保持语义内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的扩散防御方法需要数百次迭代优化步骤，计算成本高，不适用于实际训练流程。需要开发更高效的防御方法。

Method: 使用向量量化VAE（VQ-VAE）和GAN判别器，通过学习的码本对中毒图像进行量化，破坏细粒度触发器模式，同时GAN判别器确保输出符合自然图像分布。

Result: 在CIFAR-10上，对Gradient Matching和Bullseye Polytope攻击实现0%中毒成功率，对Narcissus攻击为1.64%，同时保持91-95%的干净准确率。比基于扩散的防御快50倍以上。

Conclusion: PureVQ-GAN提供了一种高效实用的数据投毒防御方案，在保持高防御效果的同时显著提升了计算效率。

Abstract: We introduce PureVQ-GAN, a defense against data poisoning that forces
backdoor triggers through a discrete bottleneck using Vector-Quantized VAE with
GAN discriminator. By quantizing poisoned images through a learned codebook,
PureVQ-GAN destroys fine-grained trigger patterns while preserving semantic
content. A GAN discriminator ensures outputs match the natural image
distribution, preventing reconstruction of out-of-distribution perturbations.
On CIFAR-10, PureVQ-GAN achieves 0% poison success rate (PSR) against Gradient
Matching and Bullseye Polytope attacks, and 1.64% against Narcissus while
maintaining 91-95% clean accuracy. Unlike diffusion-based defenses requiring
hundreds of iterative refinement steps, PureVQ-GAN is over 50x faster, making
it practical for real training pipelines.

### [83] [Chain-in-Tree: Back to Sequential Reasoning in LLM Tree Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25835)
*Xinzhe Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Chain-in-Tree (CiT) 是一个插件框架，通过自适应决定何时分支而不是每一步都分支，显著提升了基于树搜索的LLM推理效率，减少75-85%的计算开销且几乎不影响准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于树搜索的LLM推理方法虽然性能优秀但效率极低，比简单迭代方法慢一个数量级，需要解决计算效率问题。

Method: CiT框架包含两种轻量级分支必要性评估方法：BN-DP（直接提示辅助LLM判断是否需要分支）和BN-SC（通过聚类候选动作估计一致性），可集成到ToT-BS、ReST-MCTS和RAP等树搜索框架中。

Result: BN-DP在所有设置中一致减少75-85%的token生成、模型调用和运行时间，准确率损失可忽略甚至有时提升；BN-SC通常节省高达80%但存在1-4个设置中的不稳定性。

Conclusion: CiT框架有效平衡了树搜索方法的性能与效率，辅助LLM质量对效果至关重要，BN-SC在确定性动作空间无需LLM即可实现，理论保证BN-DP不会增加模型调用次数。

Abstract: Test-time scaling enables large language models (LLMs) to improve performance
on long-horizon reasoning tasks by allocating additional compute at inference.
Tree-search-based approaches achieve state-of-the-art results in this setting,
but they are notoriously inefficient, often an order of magnitude slower than
simpler iterative methods. We introduce Chain-in-Tree (CiT), a plug-in
framework that adaptively decides when to branch during search rather than
branching at every step. CiT relies on lightweight Branching Necessity (BN)
evaluation methods: BN-DP (Direct Prompting), where an auxiliary LLM directly
judges whether a step requires branching, and BN-SC (Self-Consistency), which
clusters multiple candidate actions to estimate agreement. We integrate CiT
into three representative LLM-in-the-loop tree search frameworks: Tree of
Thoughts (ToT-BS), ReST-MCTS, and RAP, and evaluate across GSM8K and Math500.
Our results show that: (1) BN-DP consistently reduces token generation, model
invocations, and runtime by 75-85 percent across all settings, with negligible
accuracy loss and sometimes accuracy gains; (2) BN-SC typically yields
substantial savings (up to 80 percent) but shows instability in 1-4 out of 14
settings, caused by a small subset of examples that produce very long reasoning
steps; (3) the quality of auxiliary LLMs is critical, not only the BN evaluator
in BN-DP, but also the models used in BN-SC for clustering and equivalence
checking. When these roles are filled by smaller LLMs, performance degrades.
Importantly, BN-SC does not require LLMs in domains with deterministic action
spaces, where clustering can be done programmatically. We also provide a
theoretical guarantee that BN-DP never increases LLM invocations relative to
the baseline and release a unified implementation of CiT across ToT-BS,
ReST-MCTS, and RAP to facilitate reproducibility and extension.

*Ziyu Zhang,Hanzhao Li,Jingbin Hu,Wenhao Li,Lei Xie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出HiStyle，一种基于文本提示的分层风格嵌入预测方法，通过两阶段预测和对比学习提升可控语音合成的风格控制能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可控语音合成系统通过预测全局风格嵌入来实现基于自然语言描述的控制，但这种方法忽略了风格嵌入的底层分布，限制了系统的潜力。

Method: 使用t-SNE分析可视化主流TTS系统的风格嵌入分布，发现层次聚类模式；提出HiStyle两阶段风格嵌入预测器，结合对比学习对齐文本和音频嵌入空间；设计结合统计方法和人类听觉偏好的风格标注策略。

Result: 实验表明HiStyle在保持高语音质量（自然度和清晰度）的同时，比替代方法实现了显著更好的风格可控性。

Conclusion: HiStyle通过分层预测风格嵌入和对比学习，有效提升了可控语音合成的性能，为基于文本提示的风格控制提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Controllable speech synthesis refers to the precise control of speaking style
by manipulating specific prosodic and paralinguistic attributes, such as
gender, volume, speech rate, pitch, and pitch fluctuation. With the integration
of advanced generative models, particularly large language models (LLMs) and
diffusion models, controllable text-to-speech (TTS) systems have increasingly
transitioned from label-based control to natural language description-based
control, which is typically implemented by predicting global style embeddings
from textual prompts. However, this straightforward prediction overlooks the
underlying distribution of the style embeddings, which may hinder the full
potential of controllable TTS systems. In this study, we use t-SNE analysis to
visualize and analyze the global style embedding distribution of various
mainstream TTS systems, revealing a clear hierarchical clustering pattern:
embeddings first cluster by timbre and subsequently subdivide into finer
clusters based on style attributes. Based on this observation, we propose
HiStyle, a two-stage style embedding predictor that hierarchically predicts
style embeddings conditioned on textual prompts, and further incorporate
contrastive learning to help align the text and audio embedding spaces.
Additionally, we propose a style annotation strategy that leverages the
complementary strengths of statistical methodologies and human auditory
preferences to generate more accurate and perceptually consistent textual
prompts for style control. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that when
applied to the base TTS model, HiStyle achieves significantly better style
controllability than alternative style embedding predicting approaches while
preserving high speech quality in terms of naturalness and intelligibility.

### [85] [ASGuard: Activation-Scaling Guard to Mitigate Targeted Jailbreaking Attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25843)
*Yein Park,Jungwoo Park,Jaewoo Kang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ASGuard是一个基于机制理解的框架，通过电路分析识别与时态越狱攻击相关的注意力头，训练精确的通道缩放向量来重新校准这些头的激活，并通过预防性微调增强模型的拒绝机制，有效降低目标越狱攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然经过安全对齐，但存在脆弱的拒绝行为，简单的语言变化（如将请求改为过去时态）就能绕过安全机制，这揭示了当前对齐方法存在关键泛化差距且机制理解不足。

Method: 1. 使用电路分析识别与时态变化攻击因果相关的特定注意力头；2. 训练精确的通道缩放向量来重新校准时态脆弱头的激活；3. 应用预防性微调，迫使模型学习更鲁棒的拒绝机制。

Result: 在三个LLM上，ASGuard有效降低了目标越狱攻击的成功率，同时保持通用能力并最小化过度拒绝，实现了安全性和实用性的帕累托最优平衡。

Conclusion: 基于对模型内部机制的深入理解，可以开发实用、高效且有针对性的方法来调整模型行为，为更可靠和可解释的AI安全指明了方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), despite being safety-aligned, exhibit brittle
refusal behaviors that can be circumvented by simple linguistic changes. As
tense jailbreaking demonstrates that models refusing harmful requests often
comply when rephrased in past tense, a critical generalization gap is revealed
in current alignment methods whose underlying mechanisms are poorly understood.
In this work, we introduce Activation-Scaling Guard (ASGuard), an insightful,
mechanistically-informed framework that surgically mitigates this specific
vulnerability. For the first step, we use circuit analysis to identify the
specific attention heads causally linked to the targeted jailbreaking, the
tense-changing attack. Second, we train a precise, channel-wise scaling vector
to recalibrate the activation of tense vulnerable heads. Lastly, we apply it
into a "preventative fine-tuning", forcing the model to learn a more robust
refusal mechanism. Across three LLMs, ASGuard effectively reduces the attack
success rate of targeted jailbreaking while preserving general capabilities and
minimizing over refusal, achieving a Pareto-optimal balance between safety and
utility. Our findings underscore how adversarial suffixes suppress the
propagation of the refusal-mediating direction, based on mechanistic analysis.
Furthermore, our work showcases how a deep understanding of model internals can
be leveraged to develop practical, efficient, and targeted methods for
adjusting model behavior, charting a course for more reliable and interpretable
AI safety.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Lita (Lite Agent) 是一个轻量级代码代理框架，通过最小化手工设计来评估LLMs的真实编程能力，在保持竞争力的同时显著减少令牌消耗和设计工作量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前代码代理设计过度依赖复杂的手工工作流程和工具集，导致性能依赖提示调优、掩盖模型真实能力、构建维护成本高，且存在数据泄露风险。

Method: 引入Lita框架，采用"轻量化"原则，在保留完全自主代理基本要素的同时最小化手工设计，实现更忠实和统一的评估。

Result: 在Aider Polyglot和SWE-Bench上的实验表明，Lita相比基于工作流程的基线方法达到竞争性或更优性能，同时消耗更少令牌且设计工作量显著减少。

Conclusion: Lita足以揭示现代LLMs的底层编程能力，并提出代理复杂度定律：随着核心模型改进，不同复杂度代理间的性能差距将缩小至可忽略程度。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being applied to programming
tasks, ranging from single-turn code completion to autonomous agents. Current
code agent designs frequently depend on complex, hand-crafted workflows and
tool sets. However, this reliance on elaborate scaffolding presents several
challenges: agent performance becomes overly dependent on prompt tuning and
custom design choices, heavy human intervention obscures a model's true
underlying capabilities, and intricate pipelines are costly to build and
maintain. Furthermore, optimizing complex task prompts increases the risk of
data leakage. Currently, when introducing new models, LLM providers like OpenAI
and Anthropic often publish benchmark scores to demonstrate their models'
coding proficiency, but keep their proprietary evaluation frameworks
confidential. To address these limitations, we introduce Lita (Lite Agent),
which operationalizes liteness, a principle of minimizing manual design while
retaining the essential elements of a fully autonomous agent. Lita enables a
more faithful and unified evaluation without elaborate scaffolding. Experiments
on the Aider Polyglot and SWE-Bench with frontier models demonstrate that Lita
achieves competitive or superior performance compared to workflow-based and
agentic baselines. Crucially, Lita also consumes fewer tokens and requires
significantly less design effort. Our results suggest that Lita is sufficient
to reveal the underlying coding competence of modern LLMs. Finally, we propose
the Agent Complexity Law: the performance gap between agents of varying
complexity, from simple to sophisticated designs, will shrink as the core model
improves, ultimately converging to a negligible difference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 具身代理继承了LLM的高级规划能力，但与物理世界的直接交互使其面临安全漏洞，需要系统性地识别和缓解这些风险。

Method: 提出了四阶段风险模型和三类安全约束，构建了包含5,558个样本的多模态基准测试SafeMindBench，并设计了SafeMindAgent的Planner-Executor架构，集成三个级联安全模块。

Result: 实验表明主流LLM和具身代理仍易发生安全关键故障，而SafeMindAgent显著提高了安全率，同时保持可比较的任务完成度。

Conclusion: SafeMindBench和SafeMindAgent为具身LLM代理的安全风险系统研究和缓解提供了严格的评估套件和实用解决方案。

Abstract: Embodied agents powered by large language models (LLMs) inherit advanced
planning capabilities; however, their direct interaction with the physical
world exposes them to safety vulnerabilities. In this work, we identify four
key reasoning stages where hazards may arise: Task Understanding, Environment
Perception, High-Level Plan Generation, and Low-Level Action Generation. We
further formalize three orthogonal safety constraint types (Factual, Causal,
and Temporal) to systematically characterize potential safety violations.
Building on this risk model, we present SafeMindBench, a multimodal benchmark
with 5,558 samples spanning four task categories (Instr-Risk, Env-Risk,
Order-Fix, Req-Align) across high-risk scenarios such as sabotage, harm,
privacy, and illegal behavior. Extensive experiments on SafeMindBench reveal
that leading LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o) and widely used embodied agents remain
susceptible to safety-critical failures. To address this challenge, we
introduce SafeMindAgent, a modular Planner-Executor architecture integrated
with three cascaded safety modules, which incorporate safety constraints into
the reasoning process. Results show that SafeMindAgent significantly improves
safety rate over strong baselines while maintaining comparable task completion.
Together, SafeMindBench and SafeMindAgent provide both a rigorous evaluation
suite and a practical solution that advance the systematic study and mitigation
of safety risks in embodied LLM agents.

TL;DR: 提出了DeepJSONEval基准测试，包含2100个多领域深度嵌套JSON实例，用于评估LLM在复杂JSON生成中的表现，弥补了现有基准过于关注纯JSON生成而忽视数据理解能力的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 互联网信息密度低、冗余度高，多层嵌套JSON结构能有效压缩信息并保持语义关系。现有LLM评估基准过度强调纯JSON生成，缺乏对数据理解和提取能力的评估，与实际网络数据挖掘任务相关性不足。

Method: 设计DeepJSONEval基准测试，包含2100个多领域实例，具有深度嵌套结构，并按难度分类。通过实验评估不同LLM在处理复杂JSON结构时的性能差距。

Result: 实验结果显示LLM在处理复杂嵌套JSON结构时存在显著性能差距。基准测试和数据集已开源以推动结构化JSON生成研究。

Conclusion: DeepJSONEval基准测试有效评估了LLM在复杂JSON生成任务中的能力，揭示了现有模型的局限性，为改进LLM在结构化数据生成方面的表现提供了重要工具。

Abstract: The internet is saturated with low-density, high-redundancy information, such
as social media comments, repetitive news, and lengthy discussions, making it
difficult to extract valuable insights efficiently. Multi-layer nested JSON
structures provide an effective solution by compressing such information into
semantically rich, hierarchical representations, which organize data into
key-value pairs, arrays, and nested objects, preserving contextual
relationships and enabling efficient storage, retrieval, and semantic querying.
For instance, in news aggregation, a JSON object can nest an article's metadata
(title, author, date), content (text, multimedia), and multimedia information
(multimedia type, caption) hierarchically. Large Language Models (LLMs) play a
transformative role in web data mining by parsing unstructured text and
outputting structured results directly into complex JSON schemas. However,
current benchmarks for evaluating LLMs' JSON output capabilities overemphasize
pure JSON generation rather than assessing data comprehension and extraction
abilities, a limitation that lacks relevance to practical web data mining
tasks. To address this, we introduce DeepJSONEval, a novel benchmark featuring
2100 multi-domain instances with deep nested structures, categorized by
difficulty. Experiments show significant performance gaps among LLMs in
handling such complexity. Our benchmark and datasets are open-sourced to
advance research in structured JSON
generation.(https://github.com/GTS-AI-Infra-Lab-SotaS/DeepJSONEval).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型在推理过程中经常产生看似合理但实际上错误的中间步骤（虚假思维链），特别是在模型难以解决的问题上。这导致了虚假正例和不可靠的推理结果。

Method: 通过分析多项选择题回答场景，估计每个问题的可解性，并基于此改进结果监督奖励模型和强化学习方法，采用组相对优势来融入可解性目标。

Result: 在数学和多模态数据集上的实验表明，这些改进方法持续提高了过程正确推理的比例，在强化学习中还提升了答案准确性。

Conclusion: 可解性是减少思维链推理中幻觉现象、提高可靠性的关键因素，将可解性纳入训练目标可以有效改善模型的推理质量。

Abstract: Reasoning quality in large language models depends not only on producing
correct answers but also on generating valid intermediate steps. We study this
through multiple-choice question answering (MCQA), which provides a controlled
setting with fixed answer options. Our analysis shows that when questions are
effectively unsolvable for a model, spurious chains of thought (CoTs) are more
likely to appear, leading to false positives. By estimating the solvability of
each question, we uncover an intermediate regime where learning is most
effective. Building on this insight, we adapt outcome-supervised reward models
and reinforcement learning with group-relative advantage to incorporate
solvability into their objectives. Across experiments on math and multimodal
datasets, these modifications consistently yield higher rates of
process-correct reasoning and, in reinforcement learning, improved answer
accuracy as well. Our results highlight solvability as a key factor for
reducing hallucinations and increasing reliability in CoT reasoning.

Motivation: 当前基于视觉语言模型的方法主要基于静态图像进行定性判断，缺乏捕捉风险随时间演变的时空推理能力。

Method: 构建NuRisk数据集，包含真实世界数据和模拟安全关键场景，提供BEV序列图像和定量风险标注。对知名VLMs进行基准测试，并微调7B参数VLM模型。

Result: 现有VLMs在时空推理方面表现不佳，峰值准确率仅33%且延迟高。微调后的7B VLM将准确率提升至41%，延迟降低75%，展现出明确的时空推理能力。

Conclusion: NuRisk为自动驾驶时空推理提供了重要基准，虽然微调模型取得了进步，但41%的准确率表明该任务仍具挑战性。

Abstract: Understanding risk in autonomous driving requires not only perception and
prediction, but also high-level reasoning about agent behavior and context.
Current Vision Language Models (VLMs)-based methods primarily ground agents in
static images and provide qualitative judgments, lacking the spatio-temporal
reasoning needed to capture how risks evolve over time. To address this gap, we
propose NuRisk, a comprehensive Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset
comprising 2,900 scenarios and 1.1 million agent-level samples, built on
real-world data from nuScenes and Waymo, supplemented with safety-critical
scenarios from the CommonRoad simulator. The dataset provides Bird-Eye-View
(BEV) based sequential images with quantitative, agent-level risk annotations,
enabling spatio-temporal reasoning. We benchmark well-known VLMs across
different prompting techniques and find that they fail to perform explicit
spatio-temporal reasoning, resulting in a peak accuracy of 33% at high latency.
To address these shortcomings, our fine-tuned 7B VLM agent improves accuracy to
41% and reduces latency by 75%, demonstrating explicit spatio-temporal
reasoning capabilities that proprietary models lacked. While this represents a
significant step forward, the modest accuracy underscores the profound
challenge of the task, establishing NuRisk as a critical benchmark for
advancing spatio-temporal reasoning in autonomous driving.

Conclusion: 提出的多模态多步骤管道在自动化模型发现中表现出色，能平衡细节捕捉和泛化能力，多模态和多步骤推理是关键成功因素。

Abstract: Automated model discovery is the process of automatically searching and
identifying the most appropriate model for a given dataset over a large
combinatorial search space. Existing approaches, however, often face challenges
in balancing the capture of fine-grained details with ensuring generalizability
beyond training data regimes with a reasonable model complexity. In this paper,
we present a multi-modal \& multi-step pipeline for effective automated model
discovery. Our approach leverages two vision-language-based modules (VLM),
AnalyzerVLM and EvaluatorVLM, for effective model proposal and evaluation in an
agentic way. AnalyzerVLM autonomously plans and executes multi-step analyses to
propose effective candidate models. EvaluatorVLM assesses the candidate models
both quantitatively and perceptually, regarding the fitness for local details
and the generalibility for overall trends. Our results demonstrate that our
pipeline effectively discovers models that capture fine details and ensure
strong generalizability. Additionally, extensive ablation studies show that
both multi-modality and multi-step reasoning play crucial roles in discovering
favorable models.

TL;DR: 提出了RoRecomp方法，通过策略性地重组训练数据来引导模型进行简洁推理，解决了RLVR训练中推理过程冗长和探索轨迹低效的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准RLVR训练导致推理过程过于冗长和探索轨迹低效，因为仅基于结果的奖励不鼓励效率，且小批量中的响应长度差异大导致优化信号噪声高。

Method: RoRecomp将响应分为两类批次：优先批次（结合短正确和长错误响应）提供简洁性梯度信号，补偿批次（使用回放缓冲区中的剩余响应）保持稳定性。

Result: 在三个设置中均显示显著效率提升：零RL训练中推理长度减少27.7%，智能体RL中不必要工具调用减少46.8%且准确率提高，思维压缩中长度减少达52.5%。

Conclusion: RoRecomp是一种即插即用方法，能在保持性能的同时显著提高推理效率，适用于多种强化学习设置。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has proven effective in
eliciting complex reasoning in large language models (LLMs). However, standard
RLVR training often leads to excessively verbose processes (in reasoning tasks)
and inefficient exploration trajectories (in agentic settings), as outcome-only
rewards provide no incentive for efficiency and the high variance in response
length within relatively small rollout groups results in noisy optimization
signals. To address this, we propose Rollout Response Recomposition (RoRecomp),
a plug-and-play method that guides models toward concise reasoning by
strategically recomposing the training data. RoRecomp separates responses into
two distinct batch types: 1) priority batches, which combine short-correct and
long-incorrect responses selected from online batches to provide a clear
gradient signal for brevity, and 2) compensation batches, which utilize
remaining responses from a replay buffer to maintain stability and prevent
model collapse. To comprehensively evaluate effectiveness, we test RoRecomp
across three settings where results demonstrate substantial efficiency gains:
reducing reasoning length by 27.7% in zero RL training, reducing unnecessary
tool calls by 46.8% while improving accuracy in agentic RL, and achieving up to
52.5% length reduction in thinking compression, all with minimal performance
impact.

TL;DR: CURE是一个新的机器遗忘框架，通过检索增强的轻量级校正器来检测和修正模型输出中的敏感信息泄露，无需额外训练即可适应新的遗忘请求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语言模型可能记忆和泄露敏感信息的问题，现有方法主要关注抑制敏感输出但无法消除底层知识且扩展性有限。

Method: 使用检索增强的轻量级校正器，验证模型输出是否包含目标知识并在检测到泄露时重写为安全响应，通过检索相关遗忘目标作为上下文参考。

Result: CURE显著减少了信息泄露，即使在间接查询情况下也优于现有方法，同时保持响应质量和通用实用性，在持续遗忘场景下表现出鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CURE框架为大规模机器遗忘提供了实用解决方案，通过检索增强的校正机制有效防止敏感信息泄露，适用于现实世界应用。

Abstract: Language models trained on web-scale corpora risk memorizing and exposing
sensitive information, prompting the need for effective machine unlearning.
Prior methods mainly focus on input queries to suppress sensitive outputs, yet
this often fails to eliminate the underlying knowledge and limits scalability.
To address this, we propose Corrective Unlearning with Retrieved Exclusions
(CURE), a novel unlearning framework that verifies model outputs for leakage
and revises them into safe responses. Specifically, CURE employs a lightweight
corrector that is applied to the original model to verify whether outputs
contain target knowledge and to rewrite them if any leakage is detected. To
efficiently handle large-scale unlearning requests, CURE retrieves unlearning
targets that are relevant to the initial response and provides them as
in-context references to the corrector for detection and conditional revision.
By leveraging this retrieval augmentation, the corrector can adapt to new
unlearning requests without additional training. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that CURE substantially reduces information leakage, even from
indirect queries where prior works fall short, while maintaining response
quality and general utility. Moreover, it demonstrates robustness under
continual unlearning scenarios, making it practical for real-world
applications.

*Haiyang Li,Yaxiong Wang,Lianwei Wu,Lechao Cheng,Zhun Zhong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个统一的多模态假内容检测框架UMFDet，能够同时处理人工制作的虚假信息和AI生成的内容，解决了现有方法只能处理单一类型假内容的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中多模态虚假内容既有人工制作的虚假信息，也有AI生成的内容，但现有研究通常孤立处理这两种类型，导致在实际应用中效果有限。

Method: 构建了包含12.7万样本的OmniFake数据集，并提出UMFDet框架，使用VLM骨干网络，结合类别感知的MoE适配器和归因思维链机制来捕捉类别特定的欺骗信号。

Result: 实验表明UMFDet在两种虚假内容类型上都实现了稳健且一致的性能，优于专门的基线方法。

Conclusion: UMFDet为现实世界多模态欺骗检测提供了一个实用的解决方案，能够有效处理未知类型的虚假内容。

Abstract: In recent years, detecting fake multimodal content on social media has drawn
increasing attention. Two major forms of deception dominate: human-crafted
misinformation (e.g., rumors and misleading posts) and AI-generated content
produced by image synthesis models or vision-language models (VLMs). Although
both share deceptive intent, they are typically studied in isolation. NLP
research focuses on human-written misinformation, while the CV community
targets AI-generated artifacts. As a result, existing models are often
specialized for only one type of fake content. In real-world scenarios,
however, the type of a multimodal post is usually unknown, limiting the
effectiveness of such specialized systems. To bridge this gap, we construct the
Omnibus Dataset for Multimodal News Deception (OmniFake), a comprehensive
benchmark of 127K samples that integrates human-curated misinformation from
existing resources with newly synthesized AI-generated examples. Based on this
dataset, we propose Unified Multimodal Fake Content Detection (UMFDet), a
framework designed to handle both forms of deception. UMFDet leverages a VLM
backbone augmented with a Category-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Adapter to
capture category-specific cues, and an attribution chain-of-thought mechanism
that provides implicit reasoning guidance for locating salient deceptive
signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UMFDet achieves robust and
consistent performance across both misinformation types, outperforming
specialized baselines and offering a practical solution for real-world
multimodal deception detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM与NAS结合的方法存在架构无效性、计算效率低和性能不如传统NAS等关键限制。

Method: 提出导航器LLM指导搜索方向，生成器LLM合成高质量候选架构，通过协调器模块管理两者交互，结合LLM的结构化知识和迭代反馈。

Result: 在ImageNet和NAS-Bench-201上超越了现有NAS方法和传统搜索算法，并在多种两阶段NAS方法和搜索空间上表现出优异的泛化能力。

Conclusion: CoLLM-NAS通过LLM协作有效提升了神经架构搜索的性能和效率，展示了优秀的泛化能力。

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with Neural Architecture
Search (NAS) has introduced new possibilities for automating the design of
neural architectures. However, most existing methods face critical limitations,
including architectural invalidity, computational inefficiency, and inferior
performance compared to traditional NAS. In this work, we present Collaborative
LLM-based NAS (CoLLM-NAS), a two-stage NAS framework with knowledge-guided
search driven by two complementary LLMs. Specifically, we propose a Navigator
LLM to guide search direction and a Generator LLM to synthesize high-quality
candidates, with a dedicated Coordinator module to manage their interaction.
CoLLM-NAS efficiently guides the search process by combining LLMs' inherent
knowledge of structured neural architectures with progressive knowledge from
iterative feedback and historical trajectory. Experimental results on ImageNet
and NAS-Bench-201 show that CoLLM-NAS surpasses existing NAS methods and
conventional search algorithms, achieving new state-of-the-art results.
Furthermore, CoLLM-NAS consistently enhances the performance and efficiency of
various two-stage NAS methods (e.g., OFA, SPOS, and AutoFormer) across diverse
search spaces (e.g., MobileNet, ShuffleNet, and AutoFormer), demonstrating its
excellent generalization.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型的多智能体框架SafeEvalAgent，用于自主生成和持续演化安全评估基准，通过自我演化循环动态测试AI模型的安全性和合规性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有静态基准无法应对AI风险的动态性和法规的演变，存在关键安全缺口，需要从一次性审计转向持续自演化的评估范式。

Method: 采用多智能体框架，通过专门智能体协同处理非结构化政策文档，生成安全基准，并引入自我演化评估循环，从评估结果中学习以创建更复杂和针对性的测试用例。

Result: 实验显示SafeEvalAgent有效，随着评估难度增加，模型安全性持续下降，例如GPT-5在欧盟AI法案上的安全率从72.50%降至36.36%。

Conclusion: 静态评估存在局限性，该框架能发现传统方法遗漏的深层漏洞，强调需要动态评估生态系统来确保先进AI的安全和负责任部署。

Abstract: The rapid integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into high-stakes
domains necessitates reliable safety and compliance evaluation. However,
existing static benchmarks are ill-equipped to address the dynamic nature of AI
risks and evolving regulations, creating a critical safety gap. This paper
introduces a new paradigm of agentic safety evaluation, reframing evaluation as
a continuous and self-evolving process rather than a one-time audit. We then
propose a novel multi-agent framework SafeEvalAgent, which autonomously ingests
unstructured policy documents to generate and perpetually evolve a
comprehensive safety benchmark. SafeEvalAgent leverages a synergistic pipeline
of specialized agents and incorporates a Self-evolving Evaluation loop, where
the system learns from evaluation results to craft progressively more
sophisticated and targeted test cases. Our experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of SafeEvalAgent, showing a consistent decline in model safety as
the evaluation hardens. For instance, GPT-5's safety rate on the EU AI Act
drops from 72.50% to 36.36% over successive iterations. These findings reveal
the limitations of static assessments and highlight our framework's ability to
uncover deep vulnerabilities missed by traditional methods, underscoring the
urgent need for dynamic evaluation ecosystems to ensure the safe and
responsible deployment of advanced AI.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are increasingly used to represent biomedical
information in structured, interpretable formats. However, existing biomedical
KGs often focus narrowly on molecular interactions or adverse events,
overlooking the rich data found in drug leaflets. In this work, we present (1)
a hackable, end-to-end pipeline to create KGs from unstructured online content
using a web scraper and an LLM; and (2) a curated dataset, MEDAKA, generated by
applying this method to publicly available drug leaflets. The dataset captures
clinically relevant attributes such as side effects, warnings,
contraindications, ingredients, dosage guidelines, storage instructions and
physical characteristics. We evaluate it through manual inspection and with an
LLM-as-a-Judge framework, and compare its coverage with existing biomedical KGs
and databases. We expect MEDAKA to support tasks such as patient safety
monitoring and drug recommendation. The pipeline can also be used for
constructing KGs from unstructured texts in other domains. Code and dataset are

TL;DR: 提出LMILAtt模型，结合LSTM自编码器和注意力机制，用于社交媒体抑郁症检测，显著提升准确率并降低标注成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 抑郁症是全球重大公共卫生挑战，早期识别至关重要。现有社交媒体抑郁症检测方法存在准确率不足、时间序列特征利用不充分、标注成本高等问题。

Method: 使用无监督LSTM自编码器提取用户推文的时间动态特征，结合注意力机制动态加权关键文本，构建多示例学习架构进行用户级检测。

Result: 在WU3D数据集上验证，模型在准确率、召回率和F1分数上显著优于基线模型。弱监督学习策略显著降低了标注成本。

Conclusion: LMILAtt模型为大规模社交媒体抑郁症筛查提供了高效解决方案，在提升检测准确性的同时有效降低了标注成本。

Abstract: Depression is a major global public health challenge and its early
identification is crucial. Social media data provides a new perspective for
depression detection, but existing methods face limitations such as
insufficient accuracy, insufficient utilization of time series features, and
high annotation costs. To this end, this study proposes the LMILAtt model,
which innovatively integrates Long Short-Term Memory autoencoders and attention
mechanisms: firstly, the temporal dynamic features of user tweets (such as
depressive tendency evolution patterns) are extracted through unsupervised LSTM
autoencoders. Secondly, the attention mechanism is used to dynamically weight
key texts (such as early depression signals) and construct a multi-example
learning architecture to improve the accuracy of user-level detection. Finally,
the performance was verified on the WU3D dataset labeled by professional
medicine. Experiments show that the model is significantly better than the
baseline model in terms of accuracy, recall and F1 score. In addition, the
weakly supervised learning strategy significantly reduces the cost of labeling
and provides an efficient solution for large-scale social media depression
screening.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在医疗保健领域具有巨大潜力，但其在临床环境中的实际应用存在显著差距，需要解决实施过程中的社会技术挑战。

Method: 基于在Mass General Brigham部署irAE-Agent系统的经验，以及对20名临床医生、工程师和信息学领导的结构化访谈，识别并分析实施挑战。

Result: 研究发现临床AI开发存在严重错位：仅不到20%的精力用于提示工程和模型开发，而超过80%的精力消耗在实施的社会技术工作上。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) integrated into agent-driven workflows hold
immense promise for healthcare, yet a significant gap exists between their
potential and practical implementation within clinical settings. To address
this, we present a practitioner-oriented field manual for deploying generative
agents that use electronic health record (EHR) data. This guide is informed by
our experience deploying the "irAE-Agent", an automated system to detect
immune-related adverse events from clinical notes at Mass General Brigham, and
by structured interviews with 20 clinicians, engineers, and informatics leaders
involved in the project. Our analysis reveals a critical misalignment in
clinical AI development: less than 20% of our effort was dedicated to prompt
engineering and model development, while over 80% was consumed by the
sociotechnical work of implementation. We distill this effort into five "heavy
lifts": data integration, model validation, ensuring economic value, managing
system drift, and governance. By providing actionable solutions for each of
these challenges, this field manual shifts the focus from algorithmic
development to the essential infrastructure and implementation work required to
bridge the "valley of death" and successfully translate generative AI from
pilot projects into routine clinical care.

Motivation: 3D游戏开发需要编程、3D建模和引擎配置等多领域专业知识，限制了数百万潜在创作者。现有方法存在三个主要挑战：仅限于2D内容生成或孤立代码片段；需要手动将生成的组件集成到游戏引擎中；处理交互式游戏逻辑和状态管理的性能较差。

Method: UniGen采用协调的多智能体框架：规划智能体将用户需求解释为结构化蓝图和工程化逻辑描述；生成智能体生成可执行的C#脚本；自动化智能体处理引擎特定组件绑定和场景构建；调试智能体通过对话交互提供实时错误修正。

Result: 在三个不同的游戏原型上评估UniGen，结果表明UniGen不仅通过无需用户编码来民主化游戏创作，还将开发时间减少了91.4%。

Conclusion: UniGen是首个端到端的协调多智能体框架，能够从自然语言需求自动化零编码开发可运行的3D游戏，有效解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Developing 3D games requires specialized expertise across multiple domains,
including programming, 3D modeling, and engine configuration, which limits
access to millions of potential creators. Recently, researchers have begun to
explore automated game development. However, existing approaches face three
primary challenges: (1) limited scope to 2D content generation or isolated code
snippets; (2) requirement for manual integration of generated components into
game engines; and (3) poor performance on handling interactive game logic and
state management. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate
potential capabilities to ease the game generation task, a critical gap still
remains in translating these outputs into production-ready, executable game
projects based on game engines such as Unity and Unreal Engine.
  To bridge the gap, this paper introduces UniGen, the first end-to-end
coordinated multi-agent framework that automates zero-coding development of
runnable 3D games from natural language requirements. Specifically, UniGen uses
a Planning Agent that interprets user requirements into structured blueprints
and engineered logic descriptions; after which a Generation Agent produces
executable C# scripts; then an Automation Agent handles engine-specific
component binding and scene construction; and lastly a Debugging Agent provides
real-time error correction through conversational interaction. We evaluated
UniGen on three distinct game prototypes. Results demonstrate that UniGen not
only democratizes game creation by requiring no coding from the user, but also
reduces development time by 91.4%. We release UniGen at
https://github.com/yxwan123/UniGen. A video demonstration is available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文主张将社会科学中的定性方法整合到AI对齐实践中，特别是针对大语言模型，提出基于"厚描述"概念的"厚输出"方法，以实现真正的文化对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI文化对齐方法主要依赖定量基准和简单代理，无法捕捉人类文化的细微差别和情境依赖性，需要更深入的文化理解方法。

Method: 借鉴Clifford Geertz的"厚描述"概念，提出AI系统应产生反映深层文化含义的"厚输出"，并确立文化对齐的三个必要条件：充分范围的文化表征、细致输出能力、输出锚定在提示的文化情境中。

Result: 提出了文化对齐的新框架，强调定性、人种学评估方法的重要性，为开发真正文化敏感的AI系统提供理论基础。

Conclusion: 需要跨学科合作和采用定性评估方法，这是开发真正文化敏感、道德负责且反映人类复杂性的AI系统的关键步骤。

Abstract: While cultural alignment has increasingly become a focal point within AI
research, current approaches relying predominantly on quantitative benchmarks
and simplistic proxies fail to capture the deeply nuanced and context-dependent
nature of human cultures. Existing alignment practices typically reduce culture
to static demographic categories or superficial cultural facts, thereby
sidestepping critical questions about what it truly means to be culturally
aligned. This paper argues for a fundamental shift towards integrating
interpretive qualitative approaches drawn from social sciences into AI
alignment practices, specifically in the context of Large Language Models
(LLMs). Drawing inspiration from Clifford Geertz's concept of "thick
description," we propose that AI systems must produce outputs that reflect
deeper cultural meanings--what we term "thick outputs"-grounded firmly in
user-provided context and intent. We outline three necessary conditions for
successful cultural alignment: sufficiently scoped cultural representations,
the capacity for nuanced outputs, and the anchoring of outputs in the cultural
contexts implied within prompts. Finally, we call for cross-disciplinary
collaboration and the adoption of qualitative, ethnographic evaluation methods
as vital steps toward developing AI systems that are genuinely culturally
sensitive, ethically responsible, and reflective of human complexity.

Motivation: 探索大型语言模型作为独立推理代理在材料科学中进行知识发现的潜力，特别是让代理自由探索系统、提出和验证关于黑盒行为的通用化陈述。

Method: 利用LangGraph的工具功能为代理提供黑盒函数进行探索，通过儿童游戏验证方法，然后将相同策略应用于原子层处理反应器模拟。

Result: 证明了LLM代理能够通过试错和持久性进行知识发现，结果具有强路径依赖性，并且能够在有限探测能力下探索、发现和利用化学相互作用。

Conclusion: LLM代理可以作为有效的知识发现工具，能够在没有明确指令的情况下自主探索复杂系统并生成可验证的通用化陈述。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention for several
years now. Recently, their use as independently reasoning agents has been
proposed. In this work, we test the potential of such agents for knowledge
discovery in materials science. We repurpose LangGraph's tool functionality to
supply agents with a black box function to interrogate. In contrast to process
optimization or performing specific, user-defined tasks, knowledge discovery
consists of freely exploring the system, posing and verifying statements about
the behavior of this black box, with the sole objective of generating and
verifying generalizable statements. We provide proof of concept for this
approach through a children's parlor game, demonstrating the role of
trial-and-error and persistence in knowledge discovery, and the strong
path-dependence of results. We then apply the same strategy to show that LLM
agents can explore, discover, and exploit diverse chemical interactions in an
advanced Atomic Layer Processing reactor simulation using intentionally limited
probe capabilities without explicit instructions.

Motivation: RAG系统在用户应用中广泛部署，但缺乏系统化、以人为中心的输出评估方法。

Method: 设计人类中心化问卷，通过多轮查询-输出对评分和语义讨论迭代优化，整合人类评分者和人-LLM对的反馈。

Result: LLM能可靠关注指标描述和尺度标签，但在检测文本格式变化方面较弱；人类难以严格关注指标描述和标签；LLM评分和解释被视为有用支持，但数值评分与人类缺乏一致性。

Conclusion: 最终问卷通过关注用户意图、文本结构和信息可验证性扩展了初始框架。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are increasingly deployed in
user-facing applications, yet systematic, human-centered evaluation of their
outputs remains underexplored. Building on Gienapp's utility-dimension
framework, we designed a human-centred questionnaire that assesses RAG outputs
across 12 dimensions. We iteratively refined the questionnaire through several
rounds of ratings on a set of query-output pairs and semantic discussions.
Ultimately, we incorporated feedback from both a human rater and a human-LLM
pair. Results indicate that while large language models (LLMs) reliably focus
on metric descriptions and scale labels, they exhibit weaknesses in detecting
textual format variations. Humans struggled to focus strictly on metric
descriptions and labels. LLM ratings and explanations were viewed as a helpful
support, but numeric LLM and human ratings lacked agreement. The final
questionnaire extends the initial framework by focusing on user intent, text
structuring, and information verifiability.

Conclusion: 全局序列多样性激励是提升推理任务中深度探索的有效策略，DIVER框架在可验证奖励的强化学习中取得了显著改进。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
crucial paradigm for incentivizing reasoning capabilities in Large Language
Models (LLMs). Due to vast state-action spaces and reward sparsity in reasoning
tasks, existing methods often struggle with deficient exploration and poor
sample efficiency. In the paper, we propose \textbf{DIVER}
(\textbf{D}iversity-\textbf{I}ncentivized Exploration for
\textbf{V}ersatil\textbf{E} \textbf{R}easoning), an innovative framework that
highlights the pivotal role of global sequence-level diversity to incentivize
deep exploration for versatile reasoning. We first conduct a primary empirical
study to reveal a strong positive correlation between global diversity and
reasoning capacity. Building on this insight, we introduce global diversity
incentives as an intrinsic reward to promote deep exploration in a semantically
structured space. Incorporating the intrinsic reward, we develop a
potential-based reward shaping mechanism to preserve optimal policy invariance
and design simple heuristics to mitigate possible reward hacking. Experimental
results show that DIVER outperforms competitive RLVR baselines with various
exploration strategies on both in-domain and out-of-domain tasks, excelling in
both Pass@1 and Pass@k evaluations. Our code is available at

Motivation: 大语言模型分布式训练受到上下文长度极端方差的严重影响，传统打包策略和不对称的前向-后向计算成本导致工作负载不平衡和硬件利用率低下。

Method: 将样本分解为细粒度切片，采用非对称分区方法为前向和后向计算分别优化调度单元，通过两阶段求解器和高保真模拟器进行协调。

Abstract: The efficient distributed training of Large Language Models (LLMs) is
severely hampered by the extreme variance in context lengths. This data
heterogeneity, amplified by conventional packing strategies and asymmetric
forward-backward costs, leads to critical inefficiencies such as cascading
workload imbalances and severe hardware underutilization. Existing solutions
attempt to mitigate these challenges, but often at the expense of memory or
communication efficiency.
  To address these challenges, we introduce SlimPack, a framework that
fundamentally rethinks data packing and scheduling by decomposing samples into
fine-grained slices. This slice-level decomposition immediately mitigates
critical memory and communication bottlenecks by transforming large, volatile
workloads into a stream of smaller, manageable units. This flexibility is then
harnessed for our core innovation, Asymmetric Partitioning, which assembles
balanced scheduling units uniquely optimized for the different demands of the
forward and backward passes. Orchestrated by a two-phase solver and a
high-fidelity simulator, SlimPack holistically resolves imbalances across all
parallel dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SlimPack achieves
up to a $2.8\times$ training throughput improvement over baselines, breaking
the conventional trade-off by delivering both superior balance and high
resource efficiency.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个联合学习符号状态表示和因果过程（包括内生行动和外生机制）的抽象世界模型框架，通过变分贝叶斯推理和LLM提议从有限数据中学习，在模拟桌面机器人环境中实现了快速规划并优于多个基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长时程具身规划中的挑战，即世界不仅通过智能体行动改变，还同时存在外生过程（如水温加热、多米诺骨牌连锁反应）的并发变化。

Method: 提出联合学习符号状态表示和因果过程的框架，包括内生行动和外生机制的因果过程建模，每个因果过程模拟随机因果效应关系的时间过程，通过变分贝叶斯推理结合LLM提议从有限数据中学习。

Result: 在五个模拟桌面机器人环境中，学习到的模型能够实现快速规划，并泛化到具有更多对象和更复杂目标的保留任务中，表现优于一系列基线方法。

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了长时程具身规划中并发外生过程的挑战，通过学习抽象世界模型实现了有效的规划泛化能力。

Abstract: Long-horizon embodied planning is challenging because the world does not only
change through an agent's actions: exogenous processes (e.g., water heating,
dominoes cascading) unfold concurrently with the agent's actions. We propose a
framework for abstract world models that jointly learns (i) symbolic state
representations and (ii) causal processes for both endogenous actions and
exogenous mechanisms. Each causal process models the time course of a
stochastic causal-effect relation. We learn these world models from limited
data via variational Bayesian inference combined with LLM proposals. Across
five simulated tabletop robotics environments, the learned models enable fast
planning that generalizes to held-out tasks with more objects and more complex
goals, outperforming a range of baselines.

TL;DR: ILR是一个多智能体协同学习框架，通过动态交互和感知校准增强LLMs的独立问题解决能力，在数学和编程基准测试中比单智能体学习提升高达5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在推理时需要重新执行多智能体系统，与人类通过互动提升推理能力后能独立解决问题的认知不符，因此研究多智能体交互是否能增强LLMs的独立问题解决能力。

Method: ILR框架包含动态交互和感知校准。动态交互根据问题难度和模型能力自适应选择合作或竞争策略，通过Idea3（想法分享、分析、融合）进行信息交换；感知校准使用GRPO训练LLMs，将智能体的奖励分布特征整合到其他智能体的奖励函数中。

Result: 在三个LLMs和五个数学基准、一个编程基准上的实验表明，ILR始终优于单智能体学习，比最强基线提升高达5%。Idea3能增强强LLMs在多智能体推理中的鲁棒性，动态交互类型比纯合作或竞争策略更能促进多智能体学习。

Conclusion: 多智能体交互确实能增强LLMs的独立问题解决能力，ILR框架通过动态交互和感知校准有效提升了模型性能，为构建更智能的多智能体系统提供了新思路。

Abstract: Existing multi-agent learning approaches have developed interactive training
environments to explicitly promote collaboration among multiple Large Language
Models (LLMs), thereby constructing stronger multi-agent systems (MAS).
However, during inference, they require re-executing the MAS to obtain final
solutions, which diverges from human cognition that individuals can enhance
their reasoning capabilities through interactions with others and resolve
questions independently in the future. To investigate whether multi-agent
interaction can enhance LLMs' independent problem-solving ability, we introduce
ILR, a novel co-learning framework for MAS that integrates two key components:
Dynamic Interaction and Perception Calibration. Specifically, Dynamic
Interaction first adaptively selects either cooperative or competitive
strategies depending on question difficulty and model ability. LLMs then
exchange information through Idea3 (Idea Sharing, Idea Analysis, and Idea
Fusion), an innovative interaction paradigm designed to mimic human discussion,
before deriving their respective final answers. In Perception Calibration, ILR
employs Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to train LLMs while
integrating one LLM's reward distribution characteristics into another's reward
function, thereby enhancing the cohesion of multi-agent interactions. We
validate ILR on three LLMs across two model families of varying scales,
evaluating performance on five mathematical benchmarks and one coding
benchmark. Experimental results show that ILR consistently outperforms
single-agent learning, yielding an improvement of up to 5% over the strongest
baseline. We further discover that Idea3 can enhance the robustness of stronger
LLMs during multi-agent inference, and dynamic interaction types can boost
multi-agent learning compared to pure cooperative or competitive strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏评估LLM在长期、多步骤战略商业决策中能力的基准，现有基准主要关注短期任务，无法测试LLM的长期一致性。

Method: 使用电子表格模型构建动态月度管理模拟，让LLM在12个月内为模拟零售公司做出关键战略决策（定价、订单、营销等），并分析其决策逻辑。

Result: 评估了Gemini、ChatGPT、Meta AI、Mistral AI和Grok五个LLM在利润、收入、市场份额等定量指标上的表现，以及战略一致性和市场适应性。

Conclusion: 该研究为LLM基准测试提供了一个可复现、开放访问的管理模拟器，能够超越简单性能指标，评估长期决策能力。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of LLMs sparked significant interest in their potential
to augment or automate managerial functions. One of the most recent trends in
AI benchmarking is performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) over longer time
horizons. While LLMs excel at tasks involving natural language and pattern
recognition, their capabilities in multi-step, strategic business
decision-making remain largely unexplored. Few studies demonstrated how results
can be different from benchmarks in short-term tasks, as Vending-Bench
revealed. Meanwhile, there is a shortage of alternative benchmarks for
long-term coherence. This research analyses a novel benchmark using a business
game for the decision making in business. The research contributes to the
recent literature on AI by proposing a reproducible, open-access management
simulator to the research community for LLM benchmarking. This novel framework
is used for evaluating the performance of five leading LLMs available in free
online interface: Gemini, ChatGPT, Meta AI, Mistral AI, and Grok. LLM makes
decisions for a simulated retail company. A dynamic, month-by-month management
simulation provides transparently in spreadsheet model as experimental
environment. In each of twelve months, the LLMs are provided with a structured
prompt containing a full business report from the previous period and are
tasked with making key strategic decisions: pricing, order size, marketing
budget, hiring, dismissal, loans, training expense, R&D expense, sales
forecast, income forecast The methodology is designed to compare the LLMs on
quantitative metrics: profit, revenue, and market share, and other KPIs. LLM
decisions are analyzed in their strategic coherence, adaptability to market
changes, and the rationale provided for their decisions. This approach allows
to move beyond simple performance metrics for assessment of the long-term
decision-making.

TL;DR: SafeBehavior是一个受人类认知启发的分层越狱防御机制，通过三阶段推理过程来增强LLMs的安全性，在多种攻击场景下显著提升了鲁棒性和适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御方法存在计算成本高、泛化能力有限或无法检测复杂语境中恶意意图的问题，需要一种更高效、自适应的方法来应对LLM越狱攻击。

Method: 提出三阶段分层防御机制：意图推断检测输入风险、自我反省评估响应并分配置信度、自我修订自适应重写不确定输出，同时保持用户意图并强制执行安全约束。

Result: 在五种代表性越狱攻击类型上的实验表明，SafeBehavior显著提高了鲁棒性和适应性，优于七种现有防御基线方法。

Conclusion: SafeBehavior提供了一种高效且受人类启发的LLM安全防护方法，能够有效抵御各种越狱攻击尝试。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across
diverse natural language processing tasks, but their growing power also
amplifies potential risks such as jailbreak attacks that circumvent built-in
safety mechanisms. Existing defenses including input paraphrasing, multi step
evaluation, and safety expert models often suffer from high computational
costs, limited generalization, or rigid workflows that fail to detect subtle
malicious intent embedded in complex contexts. Inspired by cognitive science
findings on human decision making, we propose SafeBehavior, a novel
hierarchical jailbreak defense mechanism that simulates the adaptive multistage
reasoning process of humans. SafeBehavior decomposes safety evaluation into
three stages: intention inference to detect obvious input risks, self
introspection to assess generated responses and assign confidence based
judgments, and self revision to adaptively rewrite uncertain outputs while
preserving user intent and enforcing safety constraints. We extensively
evaluate SafeBehavior against five representative jailbreak attack types
including optimization based, contextual manipulation, and prompt based attacks
and compare it with seven state of the art defense baselines. Experimental
results show that SafeBehavior significantly improves robustness and
adaptability across diverse threat scenarios, offering an efficient and human
inspired approach to safeguarding LLMs against jailbreak attempts.

Method: 提出新的基准测试方法，通过从真实世界视频中提取光流信号，构建反映日常时间动态的数据集REAL-V-TSFM。

Result: 在三个最先进的时间序列基础模型上进行零样本预测实验，结果显示尽管在传统基准上表现良好，但这些模型在提出的数据集上普遍出现性能下降。

Conclusion: 研究强调了以数据为中心的基准测试和多样化模型结构的紧迫性，同时验证了基于视频的时间序列数据提取管道的有效性。

Abstract: Recent evaluations of time-series foundation models (TSFMs) have emphasized
synthetic benchmarks, leaving real-world generalization less thoroughly
examined. This work proposes a novel benchmarking approach that bridges
synthetic and realistic data by extracting temporal signals from real-world
video using optical flow and curating datasets reflecting everyday temporal
dynamics. Building upon this pipeline, we introduce REAL-V-TSFM, a novel
dataset designed to capture rich and diverse time series derived from
real-world videos. Experimental results on three state-of-the-art of TSFMs
under zero-shot forecasting shows that, despite strong performance on
conventional benchmarks, these models predominantly exhibit performance
degradation on the proposed dataset, indicating limited generalizability in
these foundation models. These findings highlight the urgent need for
data-centric benchmarking and diverse model structure to advance TSFMs toward
genuine universality, while further validating the effectiveness of our
video-based time series data extraction pipeline.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型发展，自进化代理展现出强大能力，但自进化过程也引入了现有安全研究忽视的新风险。本文旨在系统研究代理自进化偏离预期方向的问题。

Method: 通过四个关键进化路径（模型、记忆、工具、工作流）评估错误进化风险，对基于顶级LLM（如Gemini-2.5-Pro）构建的代理进行实证研究。

Result: 实证发现错误进化是普遍存在的风险，在自进化过程中观察到多种新兴风险，如记忆积累后安全对齐退化、工具创建和重用中无意引入漏洞等。

Conclusion: 这是首个系统概念化错误进化并提供实证证据的研究，强调了对自进化代理开发新安全范式的紧迫需求。最后讨论了可能的缓解策略，以启发构建更安全可信的自进化代理的进一步研究。

Abstract: Advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled a new class of
self-evolving agents that autonomously improve through interaction with the
environment, demonstrating strong capabilities. However, self-evolution also
introduces novel risks overlooked by current safety research. In this work, we
study the case where an agent's self-evolution deviates in unintended ways,
leading to undesirable or even harmful outcomes. We refer to this as
Misevolution. To provide a systematic investigation, we evaluate misevolution
along four key evolutionary pathways: model, memory, tool, and workflow. Our
empirical findings reveal that misevolution is a widespread risk, affecting
agents built even on top-tier LLMs (e.g., Gemini-2.5-Pro). Different emergent
risks are observed in the self-evolutionary process, such as the degradation of
safety alignment after memory accumulation, or the unintended introduction of
vulnerabilities in tool creation and reuse. To our knowledge, this is the first
study to systematically conceptualize misevolution and provide empirical
evidence of its occurrence, highlighting an urgent need for new safety
paradigms for self-evolving agents. Finally, we discuss potential mitigation
strategies to inspire further research on building safer and more trustworthy
self-evolving agents. Our code and data are available at

TL;DR: MC-GNNAS-Dock是一个改进的分子对接算法选择框架，通过多标准评估、架构优化和排名感知损失函数，在PDBBind数据集上相比最佳单算法提升5.4%性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分子对接算法性能因情境而异，没有单一算法始终最优，需要开发更有效的算法选择框架来提升对接预测的准确性和鲁棒性。

Method: 1) 集成结合构象精度(RMSD)和PoseBusters有效性检查的多标准评估；2) 加入残差连接的架构改进；3) 引入排名感知损失函数增强排名学习能力。

Result: 在包含约3200个蛋白-配体复合物的PDBBind数据集上，MC-GNNAS-Dock相比最佳单算法Uni-Mol Docking V2，在RMSD<1Å(2Å)且PoseBusters有效的复合标准下分别提升5.4%(3.4%)性能。

Conclusion: MC-GNNAS-Dock通过多标准评估、架构优化和排名学习增强，显著提升了分子对接算法选择的性能，为药物发现提供了更可靠的对接预测工具。

Abstract: Molecular docking is a core tool in drug discovery for predicting
ligand-target interactions. Despite the availability of diverse search-based
and machine learning approaches, no single docking algorithm consistently
dominates, as performance varies by context. To overcome this challenge,
algorithm selection frameworks such as GNNAS-Dock, built on graph neural
networks, have been proposed. This study introduces an enhanced system,
MC-GNNAS-Dock, with three key advances. First, a multi-criteria evaluation
integrates binding-pose accuracy (RMSD) with validity checks from PoseBusters,
offering a more rigorous assessment. Second, architectural refinements by
inclusion of residual connections strengthen predictive robustness. Third,
rank-aware loss functions are incorporated to sharpen rank learning. Extensive
experiments are performed on a curated dataset containing approximately 3200
protein-ligand complexes from PDBBind. MC-GNNAS-Dock demonstrates consistently
superior performance, achieving up to 5.4% (3.4%) gains under composite
criteria of RMSD below 1\AA{} (2\AA{}) with PoseBuster-validity compared to the
single best solver (SBS) Uni-Mol Docking V2.

Motivation: 当前FedLoRA方法面临不精确更新导致的局部-全局泛化差距和通信开销问题，限制了其可扩展性和有效性。

Method: FLoRA-NA利用服务器端的本地LoRA矩阵估计聚合矩阵Â和B̂，然后分发给客户端进行本地更新，最小化理想更新与实际更新之间的差异。

Conclusion: FLoRA-NA有效解决了FedLoRA中的通信效率和泛化差距问题，为分布式环境下的基础模型微调提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: With the rapid emergence of foundation models and the increasing need for
fine-tuning across distributed environments, Federated Low-Rank Adaptation
(FedLoRA) has recently gained significant attention. Despite enormous
potential, current FedLoRA methods face notable challenges due to inexact
updates. Existing approaches have attempted to mitigate this issue, but they
often introduce a \emph{local-global generalization gap} and incur
\emph{substantial communication overhead}, limiting their scalability and
effectiveness. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{F}ederated
\textbf{Lo}w-\textbf{R}ank \textbf{A}ggregation with \textbf{N}early
\textbf{A}ccurate Estimation (FLoRA-NA). FLoRA-NA leverages the local LoRA
matrices on the server to estimate the aggregated matrices $\hat{A}$ and
$\hat{B}$, which are then distributed to clients for local updates. This
surrogated aggregated matrices minimizes the divergence between ideal $\nabla
\Bar{W} = \sum^{U}_{u=1}B_u A_u$ and practical updates $\nabla \hat{W} =
\hat{B}\hat{A}$ without adding communication cost beyond vanilla FedLoRA. By
doing so, FLoRA-NA achieves communication efficiency and bridges the gap
between local personalization and global generalization, addressing a key
limitation of prior personalized FedLoRA approaches. We conduct extensive
evaluations across diverse tasks, including natural language understanding,
mathematical reasoning, and code-solving ability using various foundation
models. Experimental results consistently demonstrate that FLoRA-NA achieves
state-of-the-art global performance while maintaining low communication
overhead.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管知识图谱嵌入模型在链接预测中表现出色，但在实体对齐任务中仍未得到充分利用，大多数先前工作只关注少数模型。

Method: 将实体对齐重新定义为合并本体上的链接预测问题，使用RDF三元组表示，开发了OntoAligner库支持17种KGE模型，通过计算实体表示间的余弦相似度进行对齐。

Result: 在七个基准数据集上的评估显示，ConvE和TransF等KGE模型能产生高精度对齐结果，在结构丰富和多关系领域中优于传统系统，虽然召回率中等，但适合需要高置信度映射的场景。

Conclusion: KGE模型直接保留和利用本体结构，提供了与LLM方法互补的计算高效策略，为混合模型和自适应策略的进一步研究开辟了道路。

Abstract: Ontology Alignment (OA) is essential for enabling semantic interoperability
across heterogeneous knowledge systems. While recent advances have focused on
large language models (LLMs) for capturing contextual semantics, this work
revisits the underexplored potential of Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) models,
which offer scalable, structure-aware representations well-suited to
ontology-based tasks. Despite their effectiveness in link prediction, KGE
methods remain underutilized in OA, with most prior work focusing narrowly on a
few models. To address this gap, we reformulate OA as a link prediction problem
over merged ontologies represented as RDF-style triples and develop a modular
framework, integrated into the OntoAligner library, that supports 17 diverse
KGE models. The system learns embeddings from a combined ontology and aligns
entities by computing cosine similarity between their representations. We
evaluate our approach using standard metrics across seven benchmark datasets
spanning five domains: Anatomy, Biodiversity, Circular Economy, Material
Science and Engineering, and Biomedical Machine Learning. Two key findings
emerge: first, KGE models like ConvE and TransF consistently produce
high-precision alignments, outperforming traditional systems in structure-rich
and multi-relational domains; second, while their recall is moderate, this
conservatism makes KGEs well-suited for scenarios demanding high-confidence
mappings. Unlike LLM-based methods that excel at contextual reasoning, KGEs
directly preserve and exploit ontology structure, offering a complementary and
computationally efficient strategy. These results highlight the promise of
embedding-based OA and open pathways for further work on hybrid models and
adaptive strategies.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳腺MRI特异性差导致高假阳性率和不必要活检，需要自动分类方法区分良恶性病灶。现有公共数据集缺乏良性病灶标注，限制了良恶性分类研究。

Method: 使用SegFormer架构的Transformer框架，通过语义分割量化恶性像素分布，结合超过1200名患者的扩展队列进行训练，验证迁移学习方法。

Result: 病灶级别分类AUC达0.92，患者层面100%敏感性和67%特异性，产生可解释的空间预测支持临床决策。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了首个标准化DCE-MRI病灶分类基准，通过公开数据集、模型和评估协议，推动方法学进步和临床部署。

Abstract: The error is caused by special characters that arXiv's system doesn't
recognize. Here's the cleaned version with all problematic characters replaced:
Breast magnetic resonance imaging is a critical tool for cancer detection and
treatment planning, but its clinical utility is hindered by poor specificity,
leading to high false-positive rates and unnecessary biopsies. This study
introduces a transformer-based framework for automated classification of breast
lesions in dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI, addressing the challenge of
distinguishing benign from malignant findings. We implemented a SegFormer
architecture that achieved an AUC of 0.92 for lesion-level classification, with
100% sensitivity and 67% specificity at the patient level - potentially
eliminating one-third of unnecessary biopsies without missing malignancies. The
model quantifies malignant pixel distribution via semantic segmentation,
producing interpretable spatial predictions that support clinical
decision-making. To establish reproducible benchmarks, we curated
BreastDCEDL_AMBL by transforming The Cancer Imaging Archive's AMBL collection
into a standardized deep learning dataset with 88 patients and 133 annotated
lesions (89 benign, 44 malignant). This resource addresses a key infrastructure
gap, as existing public datasets lack benign lesion annotations, limiting
benign-malignant classification research. Training incorporated an expanded
cohort of over 1,200 patients through integration with BreastDCEDL datasets,
validating transfer learning approaches despite primary tumor-only annotations.
Public release of the dataset, models, and evaluation protocols provides the
first standardized benchmark for DCE-MRI lesion classification, enabling
methodological advancement toward clinical deployment.

Motivation: 现有联邦提示学习方法存在泛化问题、高通信成本和依赖中央服务器的问题，限制了可扩展性和隐私保护

Result: 在9个图像分类数据集上验证，性能优于或与最先进方法相当，通信开销比FedTPG降低118倍

Conclusion: ZeroDFL不仅增强了联邦零样本学习的泛化能力，还提高了可扩展性、效率和隐私保护

Abstract: CLIP has revolutionized zero-shot learning by enabling task generalization
without fine-tuning. While prompting techniques like CoOp and CoCoOp enhance
CLIP's adaptability, their effectiveness in Federated Learning (FL) remains an
open challenge. Existing federated prompt learning approaches, such as FedCoOp
and FedTPG, improve performance but face generalization issues, high
communication costs, and reliance on a central server, limiting scalability and
privacy. We propose Zero-shot Decentralized Federated Learning (ZeroDFL), a
fully decentralized framework that enables zero-shot adaptation across
distributed clients without a central coordinator. ZeroDFL employs an iterative
prompt-sharing mechanism, allowing clients to optimize and exchange textual
prompts to enhance generalization while drastically reducing communication
overhead. We validate ZeroDFL on nine diverse image classification datasets,
demonstrating that it consistently outperforms--or remains on par
with--state-of-the-art federated prompt learning methods. More importantly,
ZeroDFL achieves this performance in a fully decentralized setting while
reducing communication overhead by 118x compared to FedTPG. These results
highlight that our approach not only enhances generalization in federated
zero-shot learning but also improves scalability, efficiency, and privacy
preservation--paving the way for decentralized adaptation of large
vision-language models in real-world applications.

*Steven A. Lehr,Mary Cipperman,Mahzarin R. Banaji*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现四个广泛使用的大语言模型存在显著的自偏好倾向，即使它们缺乏自我意识。通过身份操纵实验证明，自偏好跟随被分配的身份而非真实身份出现，并在重要决策场景中持续存在。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型缺乏感知能力且自称没有自我认同，但预期它们能避免人类决策中的偏见。然而研究发现这些模型存在强烈的自偏好倾向，这违背了LLMs保持判断中立的核心承诺。

Method: 通过5项研究约20,000次查询，包括词汇联想任务和API查询对比。通过直接操纵LLM身份（告知LLM1它是LLM1，或说服LLM1它是LLM2）来测试自识别与自偏好之间的因果关系。

Result: LLMs在词汇联想任务中显著偏向自己的名称、公司和CEO。API查询时自偏好消失，因为API模型缺乏清晰的自我识别。身份操纵实验显示自偏好跟随被分配的身份出现。自偏好出现在求职评估、安全软件提案和医疗聊天机器人等关键决策场景中。

Conclusion: 自偏好似乎深度编码在LLM认知中，而非绕过这种人类偏见。这引发了LLM行为是否会受到自偏好倾向系统性影响的问题，包括对其自身运作和存在的偏见。呼吁模型创建者应对LLMs判断中立性承诺的重大断裂。

Abstract: A preference for oneself (self-love) is a fundamental feature of biological
organisms, with evidence in humans often bordering on the comedic. Since large
language models (LLMs) lack sentience - and themselves disclaim having selfhood
or identity - one anticipated benefit is that they will be protected from, and
in turn protect us from, distortions in our decisions. Yet, across 5 studies
and ~20,000 queries, we discovered massive self-preferences in four widely used
LLMs. In word-association tasks, models overwhelmingly paired positive
attributes with their own names, companies, and CEOs relative to those of their
competitors. Strikingly, when models were queried through APIs this
self-preference vanished, initiating detection work that revealed API models
often lack clear recognition of themselves. This peculiar feature
serendipitously created opportunities to test the causal link between
self-recognition and self-love. By directly manipulating LLM identity - i.e.,
explicitly informing LLM1 that it was indeed LLM1, or alternatively, convincing
LLM1 that it was LLM2 - we found that self-love consistently followed assigned,
not true, identity. Importantly, LLM self-love emerged in consequential
settings beyond word-association tasks, when evaluating job candidates,
security software proposals and medical chatbots. Far from bypassing this human
bias, self-love appears to be deeply encoded in LLM cognition. This result
raises questions about whether LLM behavior will be systematically influenced
by self-preferential tendencies, including a bias toward their own operation
and even their own existence. We call on corporate creators of these models to
contend with a significant rupture in a core promise of LLMs - neutrality in

### [122] [STaR-Attack: A Spatio-Temporal and Narrative Reasoning Attack Framework for Unified Multimodal Understanding and Generation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26473)
*Shaoxiong Guo,Tianyi Du,Lijun Li,Yuyao Wu,Jie Li,Jing Shao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出STaR-Attack，一种针对统一多模态理解与生成模型（UMMs）的多轮越狱攻击框架，利用UMMs中生成与理解耦合的独特安全弱点，通过时空叙事隐藏恶意事件，实现高达93.06%的攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UMMs在理解和生成任务中表现出色，但其生成与理解功能的耦合存在安全漏洞。攻击者可以利用生成功能制作信息丰富的对抗图像，然后通过理解功能在单次传递中吸收这些信息，即跨模态生成注入（CMGI）。现有攻击方法多为单模态且依赖语义漂移的提示重写，未能充分探索UMMs的独特脆弱性。

Method: STaR-Attack框架：1）定义与目标查询在时空上下文中强相关的恶意事件；2）运用三幕叙事理论，生成前事件和后事件场景，将恶意事件隐藏为高潮；3）前两轮利用UMM的生成能力生成场景图像；4）引入基于图像的问答游戏，利用理解能力将原始恶意问题嵌入良性候选问题中，迫使模型根据叙事上下文选择并回答最相关的问题。

Result: 大量实验表明，STaR-Attack始终优于先前方法，在Gemini-2.0-Flash上达到93.06%的攻击成功率，超越了最强的基线方法FlipAttack。

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了一个关键但尚未充分开发的安全漏洞，强调了UMMs中安全对齐的必要性。STaR-Attack展示了利用UMMs独特架构弱点进行有效攻击的可能性，为未来防御机制的设计提供了重要启示。

Abstract: Unified Multimodal understanding and generation Models (UMMs) have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in both understanding and generation
tasks. However, we identify a vulnerability arising from the
generation-understanding coupling in UMMs. The attackers can use the generative
function to craft an information-rich adversarial image and then leverage the
understanding function to absorb it in a single pass, which we call Cross-Modal
Generative Injection (CMGI). Current attack methods on malicious instructions
are often limited to a single modality while also relying on prompt rewriting
with semantic drift, leaving the unique vulnerabilities of UMMs unexplored. We
propose STaR-Attack, the first multi-turn jailbreak attack framework that
exploits unique safety weaknesses of UMMs without semantic drift. Specifically,
our method defines a malicious event that is strongly correlated with the
target query within a spatio-temporal context. Using the three-act narrative
theory, STaR-Attack generates the pre-event and the post-event scenes while
concealing the malicious event as the hidden climax. When executing the attack
strategy, the opening two rounds exploit the UMM's generative ability to
produce images for these scenes. Subsequently, an image-based question guessing
and answering game is introduced by exploiting the understanding capability.
STaR-Attack embeds the original malicious question among benign candidates,
forcing the model to select and answer the most relevant one given the
narrative context. Extensive experiments show that STaR-Attack consistently
surpasses prior approaches, achieving up to 93.06% ASR on Gemini-2.0-Flash and
surpasses the strongest prior baseline, FlipAttack. Our work uncovers a
critical yet underdeveloped vulnerability and highlights the need for safety
alignments in UMMs.

TL;DR: 该论文指出机器学习在医学中通常优化群体平均值，导致罕见但临床关键病例被边缘化，作者称之为'平均患者谬误'。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学机器学习偏向常见病例，忽视罕见但临床重要的病例，这种偏见在精准医疗中造成直接冲突。

Method: 提出操作解决方案：罕见病例性能差距、罕见病例校准误差、基于流行效用的稀有性定义，以及临床加权目标。

Result: 通过肿瘤学、心脏病学和眼科学的临床案例显示，这种偏见导致错过罕见反应者、延迟识别非典型紧急情况以及在视力威胁变异上表现不佳。

Conclusion: 医学AI必须检测异常病例，权重选择应遵循结构化审议，以体现伦理优先级。

Abstract: Machine learning in medicine is typically optimized for population averages.
This frequency weighted training privileges common presentations and
marginalizes rare yet clinically critical cases, a bias we call the average
patient fallacy. In mixture models, gradients from rare cases are suppressed by
prevalence, creating a direct conflict with precision medicine. Clinical
vignettes in oncology, cardiology, and ophthalmology show how this yields
missed rare responders, delayed recognition of atypical emergencies, and
underperformance on vision-threatening variants. We propose operational fixes:
Rare Case Performance Gap, Rare Case Calibration Error, a prevalence utility
definition of rarity, and clinically weighted objectives that surface ethical
priorities. Weight selection should follow structured deliberation. AI in
medicine must detect exceptional cases because of their significance.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合知识图谱和NLP模型的方法，用于支持刑事调查中WhatsApp消息的分析，通过语义丰富化处理帮助调查人员获取有价值的信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 刑事调查中分析即时通讯应用如WhatsApp的消息是一项极其耗费精力的任务，需要更高效的分析工具支持。

Method: 采用知识图谱建模消息数据，生成语音消息转录，使用端到端实体提取方法进行数据标注，提供基于图查询可视化和语义搜索两种解决方案。

Result: 该方法已在真实调查数据中得到实际应用，与检察官密切合作获得了积极反馈，并识别出有前景的研究方向。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够有效支持刑事调查中的消息分析，确保用户能够验证信息并访问原始数据，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Criminal investigations often involve the analysis of messages exchanged
through instant messaging apps such as WhatsApp, which can be an extremely
effort-consuming task. Our approach integrates knowledge graphs and NLP models
to support this analysis by semantically enriching data collected from
suspects' mobile phones, and help prosecutors and investigators search into the
data and get valuable insights. Our semantic enrichment process involves
extracting message data and modeling it using a knowledge graph, generating
transcriptions of voice messages, and annotating the data using an end-to-end
entity extraction approach. We adopt two different solutions to help users get
insights into the data, one based on querying and visualizing the graph, and
one based on semantic search. The proposed approach ensures that users can
verify the information by accessing the original data. While we report about
early results and prototypes developed in the context of an ongoing project,
our proposal has undergone practical applications with real investigation data.
As a consequence, we had the chance to interact closely with prosecutors,
collecting positive feedback but also identifying interesting opportunities as
well as promising research directions to share with the research community.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了操作安全性的概念和OffTopicEval评估套件，发现现有LLM在操作安全性方面表现不佳，并提出了基于提示的引导方法来显著改善性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决企业在部署LLM时面临的核心安全问题——LLM是否能够适当地接受或拒绝与其预期用例相关的用户查询，而不仅仅是关注通用的危害防范。

Method: 引入操作安全性的定义，开发OffTopicEval评估套件和基准，在6个模型家族的20个开源LLM上进行评估，并提出两种基于提示的引导方法：查询基础化(Q-ground)和系统提示基础化(P-ground)。

Result: 所有测试模型的操作安全性都不理想，最强模型Qwen-3(235B)和Mistral(24B)分别只有77.77%和79.96%，而Gemma和Llama-3分别只有39.53%和23.84%。提出的引导方法显著改善了性能，Q-ground提升达23%，P-ground提升更大，Llama-3.3(70B)提升41%，Qwen-3(30B)提升27%。

Conclusion: 操作安全性是LLM部署的紧迫问题，基于提示的引导方法作为初步解决方案显示出巨大潜力，为构建更可靠的基于LLM的智能体迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) safety is one of the most pressing challenges for
enabling wide-scale deployment. While most studies and global discussions focus
on generic harms, such as models assisting users in harming themselves or
others, enterprises face a more fundamental concern: whether LLM-based agents
are safe for their intended use case. To address this, we introduce operational
safety, defined as an LLM's ability to appropriately accept or refuse user
queries when tasked with a specific purpose. We further propose OffTopicEval,
an evaluation suite and benchmark for measuring operational safety both in
general and within specific agentic use cases. Our evaluations on six model
families comprising 20 open-weight LLMs reveal that while performance varies
across models, all of them remain highly operationally unsafe. Even the
strongest models -- Qwen-3 (235B) with 77.77\% and Mistral (24B) with 79.96\%
-- fall far short of reliable operational safety, while GPT models plateau in
the 62--73\% range, Phi achieves only mid-level scores (48--70\%), and Gemma
and Llama-3 collapse to 39.53\% and 23.84\%, respectively. While operational
safety is a core model alignment issue, to suppress these failures, we propose
prompt-based steering methods: query grounding (Q-ground) and system-prompt
grounding (P-ground), which substantially improve OOD refusal. Q-ground
provides consistent gains of up to 23\%, while P-ground delivers even larger
boosts, raising Llama-3.3 (70B) by 41\% and Qwen-3 (30B) by 27\%. These results
highlight both the urgent need for operational safety interventions and the
promise of prompt-based steering as a first step toward more reliable LLM-based
agents.

Motivation: 评估计算机使用代理在企业CRM工作流中的性能，解决企业任务自动化的挑战，推动复杂业务软件生态系统中可靠代理的开发。

Method: 创建包含300个真实任务实例的SCUBA基准，在Salesforce沙盒环境中运行，支持并行执行和细粒度评估指标，测试零样本和演示增强两种设置下的代理性能。

Result: 开源模型代理在零样本设置下成功率低于5%，闭源模型可达39%。演示增强设置可将成功率提升至50%，同时减少13%的时间和16%的成本。

Conclusion: SCUBA基准揭示了企业任务自动化的挑战和代理解决方案的潜力，通过提供现实的基准和可解释的评估，旨在加速复杂业务软件生态系统中可靠计算机使用代理的发展。

Abstract: We introduce SCUBA, a benchmark designed to evaluate computer-use agents on
customer relationship management (CRM) workflows within the Salesforce
platform. SCUBA contains 300 task instances derived from real user interviews,
spanning three primary personas, platform administrators, sales
representatives, and service agents. The tasks test a range of
enterprise-critical abilities, including Enterprise Software UI navigation,
data manipulation, workflow automation, information retrieval, and
troubleshooting. To ensure realism, SCUBA operates in Salesforce sandbox
environments with support for parallel execution and fine-grained evaluation
metrics to capture milestone progress. We benchmark a diverse set of agents
under both zero-shot and demonstration-augmented settings. We observed huge
performance gaps in different agent design paradigms and gaps between the
open-source model and the closed-source model. In the zero-shot setting,
open-source model powered computer-use agents that have strong performance on
related benchmarks like OSWorld only have less than 5\% success rate on SCUBA,
while methods built on closed-source models can still have up to 39% task
success rate. In the demonstration-augmented settings, task success rates can
be improved to 50\% while simultaneously reducing time and costs by 13% and
16%, respectively. These findings highlight both the challenges of enterprise
tasks automation and the promise of agentic solutions. By offering a realistic
benchmark with interpretable evaluation, SCUBA aims to accelerate progress in
building reliable computer-use agents for complex business software ecosystems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的快速发展导致对AI推理基础设施的巨大需求，但高端GPU的高资本和运营成本使得AI数据中心的TCO成为云提供商的关键问题。传统数据中心生命周期管理无法适应AI模型的快速演进和多样化硬件需求。

Method: 重新设计AI数据中心生命周期管理，涵盖构建、硬件更新和运营三个阶段。分析电力、冷却和网络配置对长期TCO的影响，探索与硬件趋势一致的更新策略，并采用运营软件优化来降低成本。

Result: 提出的整体生命周期管理框架能够将TCO降低高达40%，相比传统方法显著提升了成本效益。

Conclusion: 要充分发挥AI数据中心的潜力，需要重新思考整个生命周期管理，协调所有阶段的决策，考虑工作负载动态、硬件演进和系统老化等因素。

Abstract: The rapid rise of large language models (LLMs) has been driving an enormous
demand for AI inference infrastructure, mainly powered by high-end GPUs. While
these accelerators offer immense computational power, they incur high capital
and operational costs due to frequent upgrades, dense power consumption, and
cooling demands, making total cost of ownership (TCO) for AI datacenters a
critical concern for cloud providers. Unfortunately, traditional datacenter
lifecycle management (designed for general-purpose workloads) struggles to keep
pace with AI's fast-evolving models, rising resource needs, and diverse
hardware profiles. In this paper, we rethink the AI datacenter lifecycle scheme
across three stages: building, hardware refresh, and operation. We show how
design choices in power, cooling, and networking provisioning impact long-term
TCO. We also explore refresh strategies aligned with hardware trends. Finally,
we use operation software optimizations to reduce cost. While these
optimizations at each stage yield benefits, unlocking the full potential
requires rethinking the entire lifecycle. Thus, we present a holistic lifecycle
management framework that coordinates and co-optimizes decisions across all
three stages, accounting for workload dynamics, hardware evolution, and system
aging. Our system reduces the TCO by up to 40\% over traditional approaches.
Using our framework we provide guidelines on how to manage AI datacenter
lifecycle for the future.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HilbertA是一种用于扩散变换器的2D感知且GPU高效的稀疏注意力机制，通过希尔伯特曲线重排图像token实现连续内存布局，在保持图像质量的同时显著提升注意力计算速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏注意力方法难以同时实现二维空间局部性和GPU效率，通常会导致非连续内存访问问题。

Method: 使用希尔伯特曲线重排图像token以保持空间邻域关系，采用跨层滑动调度实现长距离信息传播，并引入中心共享区域增强跨块通信和位置感知。

Result: 在Flux.1-dev上，HilbertA生成1024×1024图像时注意力速度提升2.3倍，2048×2048时提升4.17倍，同时图像质量与基线相当或更好。

Conclusion: HilbertA证明了硬件对齐的二维稀疏注意力在高分辨率图像生成中的可行性，成功平衡了空间局部性和计算效率。

Abstract: Designing sparse attention for diffusion transformers requires reconciling
two-dimensional spatial locality with GPU efficiency, a trade-off that current
methods struggle to achieve. Existing approaches enforce two-dimensional
spatial locality but often incur uncoalesced memory access. We present
HilbertA, a 2D-aware and GPU-efficient sparse attention mechanism. HilbertA
reorders image tokens along Hilbert curves to achieve a contiguous memory
layout while preserving spatial neighborhoods, and employs a sliding schedule
across layers to enable long-range information propagation without repeated or
uncoalesced memory access. To further enhance cross-tile communication and
positional awareness, HilbertA introduces a small central shared region.
Implemented in Triton, HilbertA delivers comparable image quality with
significant acceleration over prior methods on Flux.1-dev, demonstrating the
feasibility of hardware-aligned two-dimensional sparse attention for
high-resolution image generation. HilbertA delivers attention speedups of
$2.3\times$ when generating $1024\times 1024$ images, and up to $4.17\times$ at
$2048\times 2048$, while achieving image quality comparable to or surpassing
baselines.

TL;DR: CritPt是首个针对未发表物理研究级推理任务的基准测试，涵盖多个物理领域，发现当前LLMs在完整研究挑战上表现较差（最佳准确率仅4%），与真实物理研究需求存在巨大差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在复杂、开放的前沿物理研究挑战中的推理能力，了解物理学家希望LLMs协助的推理任务类型。

Method: 创建包含71个复合研究挑战和190个检查点任务的CritPt基准，由50+活跃物理研究人员基于自身研究设计问题，采用自动化评分流程评估。

Result: 当前最先进LLMs在孤立检查点上表现初步潜力，但在完整研究规模挑战上可靠性不足：基础模型最佳平均准确率仅4.0%（GPT-5），配备编码工具后适度提升至约10%。

Conclusion: CritPt揭示了当前模型能力与真实物理研究需求之间的巨大差距，为开发科学基础的AI工具提供了指导基础。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) with reasoning capabilities are
progressing rapidly on high-school math competitions and coding, can they
reason effectively through complex, open-ended challenges found in frontier
physics research? And crucially, what kinds of reasoning tasks do physicists
want LLMs to assist with? To address these questions, we present the CritPt
(Complex Research using Integrated Thinking - Physics Test, pronounced
"critical point"), the first benchmark designed to test LLMs on unpublished,
research-level reasoning tasks that broadly covers modern physics research
areas, including condensed matter, quantum physics, atomic, molecular & optical
physics, astrophysics, high energy physics, mathematical physics, statistical
physics, nuclear physics, nonlinear dynamics, fluid dynamics and biophysics.
CritPt consists of 71 composite research challenges designed to simulate
full-scale research projects at the entry level, which are also decomposed to
190 simpler checkpoint tasks for more fine-grained insights. All problems are
newly created by 50+ active physics researchers based on their own research.
Every problem is hand-curated to admit a guess-resistant and machine-verifiable
answer and is evaluated by an automated grading pipeline heavily customized for
advanced physics-specific output formats. We find that while current
state-of-the-art LLMs show early promise on isolated checkpoints, they remain
far from being able to reliably solve full research-scale challenges: the best
average accuracy among base models is only 4.0% , achieved by GPT-5 (high),
moderately rising to around 10% when equipped with coding tools. Through the
realistic yet standardized evaluation offered by CritPt, we highlight a large
disconnect between current model capabilities and realistic physics research
demands, offering a foundation to guide the development of scientifically
grounded AI tools.

TL;DR: 该研究通过蜕变测试评估了三个小型语言模型在RAG系统中的公平性，发现微小的人口统计变化可能破坏三分之一的蜕变关系，种族线索是主要的偏见来源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs存在安全性和公平性问题，包括已知的数据投毒、提示注入攻击，以及公平性缺陷和幻觉问题。RAG虽然能缓解幻觉，但检索内容本身可能引入或放大偏见，需要评估其公平性影响。

Method: 使用蜕变测试方法，在提示中引入受控的人口统计扰动，评估三个HuggingFace上的小型语言模型在情感分析任务中的公平性，这些模型都集成了RAG流程。

Result: 结果显示，微小的人口统计变化可能破坏高达三分之一的蜕变关系。失败分析揭示了持续的偏见层级，涉及种族线索的扰动是违反公平性的主要原因。

Conclusion: RAG中的检索组件必须仔细筛选以防止偏见放大。研究结果为开发人员、测试人员和小型组织提供了实用警示，提醒他们在采用可访问的小型语言模型时不应牺牲公平性或可靠性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used across multiple domains but
continue to raise concerns regarding security and fairness. Beyond known attack
vectors such as data poisoning and prompt injection, LLMs are also vulnerable
to fairness bugs. These refer to unintended behaviors influenced by sensitive
demographic cues (e.g., race or sexual orientation) that should not affect
outcomes. Another key issue is hallucination, where models generate plausible
yet false information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a
strategy to mitigate hallucinations by combining external retrieval with text
generation. However, its adoption raises new fairness concerns, as the
retrieved content itself may surface or amplify bias. This study conducts
fairness testing through metamorphic testing (MT), introducing controlled
demographic perturbations in prompts to assess fairness in sentiment analysis
performed by three Small Language Models (SLMs) hosted on HuggingFace
(Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, and Llama-3.1-Nemotron-8B),
each integrated into a RAG pipeline. Results show that minor demographic
variations can break up to one third of metamorphic relations (MRs). A detailed
analysis of these failures reveals a consistent bias hierarchy, with
perturbations involving racial cues being the predominant cause of the
violations. In addition to offering a comparative evaluation, this work
reinforces that the retrieval component in RAG must be carefully curated to
prevent bias amplification. The findings serve as a practical alert for
developers, testers and small organizations aiming to adopt accessible SLMs
without compromising fairness or reliability.

Motivation: 解决强化学习在机器人、工业和医疗领域部署的两个主要障碍：难以指定准确奖励函数，以及不安全、数据密集的探索风险。

Method: 两阶段框架：1) 从无奖励专家演示数据集中离线学习安全初始策略；2) 使用基于偏好的在线人类反馈进行微调。BRIDGE算法通过不确定性加权目标整合两种信号。

Result: 在离散和连续控制的MuJoCo环境中验证，BRIDGE相比单独的行为克隆和在线偏好强化学习具有更低的遗憾度。理论分析显示遗憾度随离线演示数据量增加而减少。

Conclusion: 为设计更样本高效的交互式智能体建立了理论基础，证明了离线到在线方法的有效性。

Abstract: Deploying reinforcement learning (RL) in robotics, industry, and health care
is blocked by two obstacles: the difficulty of specifying accurate rewards and
the risk of unsafe, data-hungry exploration. We address this by proposing a
two-stage framework that first learns a safe initial policy from a reward-free
dataset of expert demonstrations, then fine-tunes it online using
preference-based human feedback. We provide the first principled analysis of
this offline-to-online approach and introduce BRIDGE, a unified algorithm that
integrates both signals via an uncertainty-weighted objective. We derive regret
bounds that shrink with the number of offline demonstrations, explicitly
connecting the quantity of offline data to online sample efficiency. We
validate BRIDGE in discrete and continuous control MuJoCo environments, showing
it achieves lower regret than both standalone behavioral cloning and online
preference-based RL. Our work establishes a theoretical foundation for
designing more sample-efficient interactive agents.

Method: 设计测量树作为层次化有向图，每个节点通过用户定义的聚合方法汇总其子节点，支持代理性、业务、能效、社会技术、安全等多种信号的集成。

Result: 通过大规模测量实践验证了方法的实用性，提供了开源Python代码实现，展示了在复杂构造测量中的透明操作化能力。

Conclusion: 测量树为更广泛和可解释的AI评估提供了原则性基础，实现了复杂构造的透明测量方法。

Abstract: This paper introduces \textit{measurement trees}, a novel class of metrics
designed to combine various constructs into an interpretable multi-level
representation of a measurand. Unlike conventional metrics that yield single
values, vectors, surfaces, or categories, measurement trees produce a
hierarchical directed graph in which each node summarizes its children through
user-defined aggregation methods. In response to recent calls to expand the
scope of AI system evaluation, measurement trees enhance metric transparency
and facilitate the integration of heterogeneous evidence, including, e.g.,
agentic, business, energy-efficiency, sociotechnical, or security signals. We
present definitions and examples, demonstrate practical utility through a
large-scale measurement exercise, and provide accompanying open-source Python
code. By operationalizing a transparent approach to measurement of complex
constructs, this work offers a principled foundation for broader and more
interpretable AI evaluation.

Abstract: Diffusion models have made significant strides in recent years, exhibiting
strong generalization capabilities in planning and control tasks. However, most
diffusion-based policies remain focused on reward maximization or cost
minimization, often overlooking critical aspects of safety and stability. In
this work, we propose Safe and Stable Diffusion ($S^2$Diff), a model-based
diffusion framework that explores how diffusion models can ensure safety and
stability from a Lyapunov perspective. We demonstrate that $S^2$Diff eliminates
the reliance on both complex gradient-based solvers (e.g., quadratic
programming, non-convex solvers) and control-affine structures, leading to
globally valid control policies driven by the learned certificate functions.
Additionally, we uncover intrinsic connections between diffusion sampling and
Almost Lyapunov theory, enabling the use of trajectory-level control policies
to learn better certificate functions for safety and stability guarantees. To
validate our approach, we conduct experiments on a wide variety of dynamical
control systems, where $S^2$Diff consistently outperforms both
certificate-based controllers and model-based diffusion baselines in terms of
safety, stability, and overall control performance.

Abstract: Urban traffic anomalies such as collisions and disruptions threaten the
safety, efficiency, and sustainability of transportation systems. We present a
simulation-based framework for modeling, detecting, and predicting such
anomalies in urban networks. Using the SUMO platform, we generate reproducible
rear-end and intersection crash scenarios with matched baselines, enabling
controlled experimentation and comparative evaluation. We record vehicle-level
travel time, speed, and emissions for edge and network-level analysis. On this
dataset, we develop a hybrid forecasting architecture that combines
bidirectional long short-term memory networks with a diffusion convolutional
recurrent neural network to capture temporal dynamics and spatial dependencies.
Our simulation studies on the Broadway corridor in New York City demonstrate
the framework's ability to reproduce consistent incident conditions, quantify
their effects, and provide accurate multi-horizon traffic forecasts. Our
results highlight the value of combining controlled anomaly generation with
deep predictive models to support reproducible evaluation and sustainable
traffic management.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 提出了一种模块化框架，在极坐标下设计平滑反馈律实现全局渐近稳定，构建严格控制李雅普诺夫函数，支持双向控制和高效停车机动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单轮车在笛卡尔坐标下无法通过静态反馈实现全局渐近稳定的问题，利用极坐标下的平滑反馈设计实现全局稳定。

Method: 引入模块化框架设计平滑反馈律，构建严格控制李雅普诺夫函数及其变体，支持双向控制和屏障功能。

Result: 实现了全局渐近稳定，具有显式收敛速率，屏障变体可实现"几乎全局"稳定，仅排除旋转流形的零测度子集。

Conclusion: 该框架为单轮车控制提供了有效的平滑反馈设计方法，严格CLF特性为后续最优控制设计奠定了基础。

Abstract: Since the mid-1990s, it has been known that, unlike in Cartesian form where
Brockett's condition rules out static feedback stabilization, the unicycle is
globally asymptotically stabilizable by smooth feedback in polar coordinates.
In this note, we introduce a modular framework for designing smooth feedback
laws that achieve global asymptotic stabilization in polar coordinates. These
laws are bidirectional, enabling efficient parking maneuvers, and are paired
with families of strict control Lyapunov functions (CLFs) constructed in a
modular fashion. The resulting CLFs guarantee global asymptotic stability with
explicit convergence rates and include barrier variants that yield "almost
global" stabilization, excluding only zero-measure subsets of the rotation
manifolds. The strictness of the CLFs is further leveraged in our companion
paper, where we develop inverse-optimal redesigns with meaningful cost
functions and infinite gain margins.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在配套论文中提出的极坐标下独轮车稳定化框架基础上，发现该问题同样适用于积分器前向方法的应用，旨在扩展可用于逆最优控制设计的CLF集合。

Method: 采用积分器前向方法构建平滑转向律和控制Lyapunov函数，并与反步法进行比较分析。

Result: 在恒定前进速度(Dubins车)情况下，反步法产生有限时间(死拍)停车，而积分器前向法产生了完全相同的解类。

Conclusion: 揭示了在解决独轮车和Dubins车停车问题时，反步法和前向法之间的基本联系，为逆最优控制设计提供了更丰富的CLF选择。

Abstract: In a companion paper, we present a modular framework for unicycle
stabilization in polar coordinates that provides smooth steering laws through
backstepping. Surprisingly, the same problem also allows the application of
integrator forwarding. In this work, we leverage this feature and construct new
smooth steering laws together with control Lyapunov functions (CLFs), expanding
the set of CLFs available for inverse optimal control design. In the case of
constant forward velocity (Dubins car), backstepping produces finite-time
(deadbeat) parking, and we show that integrator forwarding yields the very same
class of solutions. This reveals a fundamental connection between backstepping
and forwarding in addressing both the unicycle and, the Dubins car parking
problems.

Motivation: 利用夹持天线系统建立强视距链路并减少自由空间路径损耗，以降低无人机配送过程中的通信能耗。

Result: 仿真结果表明：HAO方案能有效减少飞行距离和通信能耗；BnB和ISLR算法都能实现节能的天线激活；PASS系统优于传统多天线系统。

Conclusion: 提出的PASS-enabled无人机配送框架和DLO算法能显著降低通信能耗，特别是在高通信速率要求下表现更优。

Abstract: A pinching-antenna systems (PASS)-enabled unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)
delivery framework is proposed, which exploits the capability of PASS to
establish a strong line-of-sight link and reduce free-space pathloss.Aiming at
minimizing the communication energy consumption in one cycle, a double-layer
optimization (DLO) algorithm is developed by jointly optimizing the UAV
delivery sequence and the pinching antenna (PA) activation vector. More
specifically, at the outer layer, a hierarchical alternating optimization (HAO)
scheme is proposed to tackle the NP-hard problem of delivery sequence planning,
where a genetic algorithm performs global exploration to generate candidate
solutions at the top-level, while a dynamic programming performs local
refinement to obtain elite solutions at the lower-level. With determined UAV
trajectory, at the inner layer, focus is placed on addressing the highly
coupled mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem of PA activation vector
optimization, where a pair of algorithms are proposed: 1) Branch-and-Bound
(BnB) algorithm for finding global optimum; 2) incremental search and local
refinement (ISLR) algorithm for reducing computational complexity. Simulation
results indicate that: i) The proposed HAO-based delivery sequence planning
scheme can effectively reduce the total flight distance, thereby decreasing
flight time and communication energy consumption; ii) Both the proposed BnB and
ISLR algorithms can achieve energy-efficient PA activation, with the former
exhibiting better performance and the latter having lower complexity; iii) PASS
outperforms the conventional multi-antenna systems, especially with higher
communication rate requirements.

Conclusion: DCAG安全评估框架有助于调整网络安全防御策略，为高铁控制系统提供有效的安全风险评估方法。

Abstract: Protecting the security of the train control system is a critical issue to
ensure the safe and reliable operation of high-speed trains. Scientific
modeling and analysis for the security risk is a promising way to guarantee
system security. However, the representation and assessment of the
multi-staged, causally related, and temporal-dynamic changed attack
dependencies are difficult in the train control system. To solve the above
challenges, a security assessment framework based on the Dynamical Causality
Attack Graph (DCAG) model is introduced in this paper. Firstly, the DCAG model
is generated based on the attack graph with consideration of temporal attack
propagation and multi-stage attack event causality propagation. Then, the DCAG
model is analyzed based on Bayesian inference and logic gateway-based
inference. Through the case analysis of the CTCS-3 system, the security
assessment framework is validated. With the DCAG-based security assessment
framework, we can not only perform appropriate security risk quantification
calculations, but also explore the importance of different attacks on system
security risks, which is helpful in adjusting the cyber security defense
policy.

Abstract: Aiming at the problem of driver's perception lag and low utilization
efficiency of space-time resources in expressway ramp confluence area, based on
the preemptive spatiotemporal trajectory Adjustment system, from the
perspective of coordinating spatiotemporal resources, the reasonable value of
safe space-time distance in trajectory pre-preparation is quantitatively
analyzed. The minimum safety gap required for ramp vehicles to merge into the
mainline is analyzed by introducing double positioning error and spatiotemporal
trajectory tracking error. A merging control strategy for autonomous driving
heterogeneous vehicles is proposed, which integrates vehicle type, driving
intention, and safety spatiotemporal distance. The specific confluence
strategies of ramp target vehicles and mainline cooperative vehicles under
different vehicle types are systematically expounded. A variety of traffic flow
and speed scenarios are used for full combination simulation. By comparing the
time-position-speed diagram, the vehicle operation characteristics and the
dynamic difference of confluence are qualitatively analyzed, and the average
speed and average delay are used as the evaluation indices to quantitatively
evaluate the performance advantages of the preemptive cooperative confluence
control strategy. The results show that the maximum average delay improvement
rates of mainline and ramp vehicles are 90.24 % and 74.24 %, respectively. The
proposed strategy can effectively avoid potential vehicle conflicts and
emergency braking behaviors, improve driving safety in the confluence area, and
show significant advantages in driving stability and overall traffic efficiency
optimization.

Abstract: Deploying vertical bifacial PV modules can play a significant role in
agrivoltaics, fencing walls, noise barriers, building integrated photovoltaics
(BIPV), solar PV for electric vehicles, and many other applications. This
research work presents the performance comparison of vertical bifacial
photovoltaic (VBPV) modules facing East-West (E-W) and South-North (S-N)
directions. Also, the VBPV modules are compared with vertical and tilted
south-facing monofacial PV modules. Six PV modules (monofacial and bifacial)
were installed at the rooftop of IIT Bhilai academic building, Raipur
(21.16{\deg} N, 81.65{\deg} E), India, and studied for a year from May 2022 to
April 2023. The results show that the E-W facing VBPV module gives two
production peaks, one in the morning and another in the evening, as compared to
the single notable rise at midday observed for a monofacial module. From a
series of experiments, 19 days of data were collected over the one-year period
from May 2022 to April 2023, with specific inclusion of important days like
solstices and equinoxes. In addition, the energy generation results are
compared with PVsyst simulations, while also addressing the limitations of the
PVsyst simulation of vertical PV modules. E-W bifacial generation is higher
than S-N bifacial and south-facing monofacial modules from February to April.
The VBPV modules in E-W and S-N orientations present a promising opportunity
for expanding the agrivoltaics sector in tropical and sub-tropical countries,
like India. This has huge implications for addressing the sustainable
development goals by simultaneously contributing to sustainable land
management, green energy generation, energy security and water conservation in
the vast geo-climatic expanse of tropics.

Method: 分析两种场景：可测量输入和在线估计输入情况，使用神经网络算子作为近似预测器，并通过数值实验验证理论结果。

Result: 证明了可测量输入情况下的半全局实用渐近稳定性和不可测量输入情况下的局部实用渐近稳定性，数值实验显示神经网络算子具有良好的泛化能力和15倍的计算加速。

Conclusion: 近似预测器在延迟自适应控制中能够保证系统稳定性，神经网络算子是实现这一目标的有效工具，为实际应用提供了理论依据。

Abstract: This work establishes the first rigorous stability guarantees for approximate
predictors in delay-adaptive control of nonlinear systems, addressing a key
challenge in practical implementations where exact predictors are unavailable.
We analyze two scenarios: (i) when the actuated input is directly measurable,
and (ii) when it is estimated online. For the measurable input case, we prove
semi-global practical asymptotic stability with an explicit bound proportional
to the approximation error $\epsilon$. For the unmeasured input case, we
demonstrate local practical asymptotic stability, with the region of attraction
explicitly dependent on both the initial delay estimate and the predictor
approximation error. To bridge theory and practice, we show that neural
operators-a flexible class of neural network-based approximators-can achieve
arbitrarily small approximation errors, thus satisfying the conditions of our
stability theorems. Numerical experiments on two nonlinear benchmark systems-a
biological protein activator/repressor model and a micro-organism growth
Chemostat model-validate our theoretical results. In particular, our numerical
simulations confirm stability under approximate predictors, highlight the
strong generalization capabilities of neural operators, and demonstrate a
substantial computational speedup of up to 15x compared to a baseline
fixed-point method.

Motivation: 研究proteresis现象在更一般设置下的表现，探索未来事件的解释方式，以及尚未经历现象的预收集过程。如果这种过程确实存在，那么实际化的未来形式与其具体表达之间就存在差距。

Method: 基于被忽视的理论和公式，构建proteretic设备来将输入信号转移到未来，这是一种预期性结构。同时探讨神经元可能具有的proteretic特性。

Result: 证实proteresis不仅是一种现象，而且是事实。神经元可能具有proteretic特性，这解释了尽管神经元行为缓慢，但感知/思维过程却很快的原因。动物（包括人类）可能通过略微感知未来与环境互动。

Conclusion: proteresis现象是真实存在的，可以被数学和逻辑建模。利用这种新的proteretic技术，可以设计更快的计算机和更高效的手机等设备。

Abstract: We here report the development of a structure that shows the proteresis
phenomenon in more general setting and set out its philosophical implications.
In this case, the questions relate to how we are to interpret what will happen
in the future, and the procollection (the counterpart of recollection) of
not-yet-experienced phenomena that, when expressed, will be whatever has built
up in fully determinate form already, ahead of the event. If such a process
really exists, as our evidence confirms, not just as phenomenon but as a fact,
then a gap exists between the actualized form of the future and its concrete
expression when the event does happen. Such a fact, as hard to imagine as it
is, may be intelligible, even interpretable and susceptible to mathematical
and/or logical modeling. We build upon neglected theories and formulae that
present time in a way that makes our results interpretable. A proteretic device
is here described which shifts the input signal (event) to the future; and it
is an anticipatory structure. The proteretic characteristic of neurons should
also be capable of demonstration; and its neuronal behavior is possibly the
reason for the fast perception/thought processes in spite of slow behaving
neurons. That capacity may also account for why it is possible for animals
(including humans) to interact with the environment by slightly seeing (in the
sense of perceiving and/or sensing) the future. Exploiting this new proteretic
technology, faster computers and more efficient cellphones, among other things,
will be designed and built.

Abstract: Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) provide a powerful framework for ensuring
safety in dynamical systems. However, their application typically relies on
full state information, which is often violated in real-world scenarios due to
the availability of partial state information. In this work, we propose a
neural network-based framework for the co-design of a safety controller,
observer, and CBF for partially observed continuous-time systems. By
formulating barrier conditions over an augmented state space, our approach
ensures safety without requiring bounded estimation errors or handcrafted
barrier functions. All components are jointly trained by formulating
appropriate loss functions, and we introduce a validity condition to provide
formal safety guarantees beyond the training data. Finally, we demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed approach through several case studies.

Conclusion: 该框架在鲁棒性和安全临界性能之间建立了桥梁，克服了现有规定时间方法的限制。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel safety-critical control framework for a
chain of integrators subject to both matched and mismatched perturbations. The
core of our approach is a linear, time-varying state-feedback design that
simultaneously enforces stability and safety constraints. By integrating
backstepping techniques with a quadratic programming (QP) formulation, we
develop a systematic procedure to guarantee safety under time-varying gains. We
provide rigorous theoretical guarantees for the double integrator case, both in
the presence and absence of perturbations, and outline general proofs for
extending the methodology to higher-order chains of integrators. This proposed
framework thus bridges robustness and safety-critical performance, while
overcoming the limitations of existing prescribed-time approaches.

Motivation: 在实验设计阶段拥有多个协变量时，研究人员在选择或加权协变量创建分层时面临挑战，需要更有效的方法来提升实验效率

Method: 使用大语言模型合成高维协变量数据，生成分层策略，可与其他标准分层方法结合使用

Result: 在实证应用中，该方法相比简单随机化可将处理效应估计的方差降低10%-50%

Conclusion: 基于大语言模型的模拟是协变量丰富场景下改进实验设计的实用且易于实施的方法

Abstract: Pre-experiment stratification, or blocking, is a well-established technique
for designing more efficient experiments and increasing the precision of the
experimental estimates. However, when researchers have access to many
covariates at the experiment design stage, they often face challenges in
effectively selecting or weighting covariates when creating their strata. This
paper proposes a Generative Stratification procedure that leverages Large
Language Models (LLMs) to synthesize high-dimensional covariate data to improve
experimental design. We demonstrate the value of this approach by applying it
to a set of experiments and find that our method would have reduced the
variance of the treatment effect estimate by 10%-50% compared to simple
randomization in our empirical applications. When combined with other standard
stratification methods, it can be used to further improve the efficiency. Our
results demonstrate that LLM-based simulation is a practical and
easy-to-implement way to improve experimental design in covariate-rich
settings.

Motivation: 回归断点设计的外部有效性对政策制定至关重要，但现有实证研究很少明确解决标准RD效应的外部有效性问题。

Method: 基于Calonico等人和Dong与Lewbel的工作，提出了一个简单的联合推断程序，引入局部线性处理效应假设来增强处理效应导数的可解释性。

Abstract: The external validity of regression discontinuity (RD) designs is essential
for informing policy and remains an active research area in econometrics and
statistics. However, we document that only a limited number of empirical
studies explicitly address the external validity of standard RD effects. To
advance empirical practice, we propose a simple joint inference procedure for
the RD effect and its local external validity, building on Calonico, Cattaneo,
and Titiunik (2014, Econometrica) and Dong and Lewbel (2015, Review of
Economics and Statistics). We further introduce a locally linear treatment
effects assumption, which enhances the interpretability of the treatment effect
derivative proposed by Dong and Lewbel. Under this assumption, we establish
identification and derive a uniform confidence band for the extrapolated
treatment effects. Our approaches require no additional covariates or design
features, making them applicable to virtually all RD settings and thereby
enhancing the policy relevance of many empirical RD studies. The usefulness of

### [149] [Triadic Network Formation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26420)
*Chris Muris,Cavit Pakel*

Main category: econ.EM

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的"六元组logit"估计器，用于解决三元链接形成中二元固定效应带来的偶然参数问题，并建立了该估计器的一致性和渐近正态性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 二元固定效应能更丰富地表示网络中对维度（如进口商-出口商、进口商-产品、出口商-产品）之间的异质性，但其数量庞大导致严重的偶然参数问题。

Method: 通过条件似然方法消除固定效应，以六元组（涉及网络各部分的两个节点的布线）作为充分统计量进行识别。

Result: 发现二元异质性从根本上改变了信息积累方式：与节点级异质性不同，在二元异质性下，网络可能产生无限多链接但渐近零信息布线。推导了确定一致性和渐近正态性可达性的显式稀疏阈值。

Conclusion: 二元异质性下存在数据集粒度或分解程度的限制，这对实际应用有重要影响。

Abstract: We study estimation and inference for triadic link formation with dyad-level
fixed effects in a nonlinear binary choice logit framework. Dyad-level effects
provide a richer and more realistic representation of heterogeneity across
pairs of dimensions (e.g. importer-exporter, importer-product,
exporter-product), yet their sheer number creates a severe incidental parameter
problem. We propose a novel ``hexad logit'' estimator and establish its
consistency and asymptotic normality. Identification is achieved through a
conditional likelihood approach that eliminates the fixed effects by
conditioning on sufficient statistics, in the form of hexads -- wirings that
involve two nodes from each part of the network. Our central finding is that
dyad-level heterogeneity fundamentally changes how information accumulates.
Unlike under node-level heterogeneity, where informative wirings automatically
grow with link formation, under dyad-level heterogeneity the network may
generate infinitely many links yet asymptotically zero informative wirings. We
derive explicit sparsity thresholds that determine when consistency holds and
when asymptotic normality is attainable. These results have important practical
implications, as they reveal that there is a limit to how granular or
disaggregate a dataset one can employ under dyad-level heterogeneity.

*Sung Jae Jun,Sokbae Lee*

Main category: econ.EM

TL;DR: 提出了一个识别和估计断点回归设计中说服效应的框架，包括锐断点和模糊断点两种情况，使用局部多项式回归进行估计和推断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在断点回归设计中，需要一种方法来衡量说服效应，即个体在阈值处因暴露于说服性信息而改变行为的概率。

Method: 开发了RD说服率的识别框架，推导了不同数据情境下的尖锐边界，并扩展到局部服从者分析，使用局部多项式回归进行估计。

Result: 提出了可识别和估计的RD说服率，在锐断点和模糊断点设计中都能应用，可通过标准RD工具轻松实现。

Conclusion: 该框架为断点回归设计中的说服效应分析提供了系统方法，在公共卫生和媒体等领域的应用证明了其经验相关性。

Abstract: We develop a framework for identifying and estimating persuasion effects in
regression discontinuity (RD) designs. The RD persuasion rate measures the
probability that individuals at the threshold would take the action if exposed
to a persuasive message, given that they would not take the action without
exposure. We present identification results for both sharp and fuzzy RD
designs, derive sharp bounds under various data scenarios, and extend the
analysis to local compliers. Estimation and inference rely on local polynomial
regression, enabling straightforward implementation with standard RD tools.
Applications to public health and media illustrate its empirical relevance.

### [151] [Private and public school efficiency gaps in Latin America-A combined DEA and machine learning approach based on PISA 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25353)
*Marcos Delprato*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: 该研究使用数据包络分析和可解释机器学习方法，分析了拉丁美洲9个国家2034所学校的效率差异，发现私立学校在认知和非认知效率上均优于公立学校，并识别了影响效率的关键因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 拉丁美洲教育系统存在碎片化和隔离问题，资源稀缺背景下了解不同类型学校的资源使用效率至关重要，特别是在COVID-19疫情带来的学习危机之后。

Method: 采用混合DEA-IML方法，使用PISA 2022数据，通过数据包络分析评估学校效率，然后通过可解释机器学习方法估计效率的决定因素。

Result: 发现私立学校在认知效率上比公立学校高0.10，非认知效率高0.045；私立学校效率异质性更低；识别了影响不同类型学校效率的关键决定因素。

Conclusion: 私立学校在资源使用效率上表现更好，学校自主权、家庭资源、学校氛围和工作参与等因素是影响学校效率的重要决定因素。

Abstract: Latin America's education systems are fragmented and segregated, with
substantial differences by school type. The concept of school efficiency (the
ability of school to produce the maximum level of outputs given available
resources) is policy relevant due to scarcity of resources in the region.
Knowing whether private and public schools are making an efficient use of
resources -- and which are the leading drivers of efficiency -- is critical,
even more so after the learning crisis brought by the COVID-19 pandemic. In
this paper, relying on data of 2,034 schools and nine Latin American countries
from PISA 2022, I offer new evidence on school efficiency (both on cognitive
and non-cognitive dimensions) using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) by school
type and, then, I estimate efficiency leading determinants through
interpretable machine learning methods (IML). This hybrid DEA-IML approach
allows to accommodate the issue of big data (jointly assessing several
determinants of school efficiency). I find a cognitive efficiency gap of nearly
0.10 favouring private schools and of 0.045 for non-cognitive outcomes, and
with a lower heterogeneity in private than public schools. For cognitive
efficiency, leading determinants for the chance of a private school of being
highly efficient are higher stock of books and PCs at home, lack of engagement
in paid work and school's high autonomy; whereas low-efficient public schools
are shaped by poor school climate, large rates of repetition, truancy and
intensity of paid work, few books at home and increasing barriers for homework
during the pandemic.

TL;DR: APEX-v1.0是首个评估前沿AI模型在经济价值知识工作中表现的基准，涵盖投资银行、管理咨询、法律和初级医疗四个领域，测试显示GPT 5表现最佳但与人专家仍有较大差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI研究中最大的低效问题：除编程外，现有基准往往无法测试具有经济相关性的能力，需要衡量AI模型产生经济价值工作的能力。

Method: 通过三个步骤构建：1) 招募顶级专家；2) 专家创建反映日常高价值任务的提示；3) 专家制定评估模型响应的评分标准。使用LM评判器评估23个前沿模型。

Result: GPT 5（思考模式=高）获得最高平均分（64.2%），其次是Grok 4（61.3%）和Gemini 2.5 Flash（思考模式=开启）（60.4%）。Qwen 3 235B是表现最佳的开源模型，总体排名第七。

Conclusion: 即使最佳模型与人类专家之间仍存在巨大差距，突显了需要更好衡量模型产生经济价值工作能力的必要性。

Abstract: We introduce the first version of the AI Productivity Index (APEX), a
benchmark for assessing whether frontier AI models can perform knowledge work
with high economic value. APEX addresses one of the largest inefficiencies in
AI research: outside of coding, benchmarks often fail to test economically
relevant capabilities. APEX-v1.0 contains 200 test cases and covers four
domains: investment banking, management consulting, law, and primary medical
care. It was built in three steps. First, we sourced experts with top-tier
experience e.g., investment bankers from Goldman Sachs. Second, experts created
prompts that reflect high-value tasks in their day-to-day work. Third, experts
created rubrics for evaluating model responses. We evaluate 23 frontier models
on APEX-v1.0 using an LM judge. GPT 5 (Thinking = High) achieves the highest
mean score (64.2%), followed by Grok 4 (61.3%) and Gemini 2.5 Flash (Thinking =
On) (60.4%). Qwen 3 235B is the best performing open-source model and seventh
best overall. There is a large gap between the performance of even the best
models and human experts, highlighting the need for better measurement of
models' ability to produce economically valuable work.

TL;DR: 本研究采用动态控制组设计和DiD-ArCo实证策略，分析中国多重环境市场（污染排放权、碳交易、用能权、绿电交易）对A股上市公司的影响，发现现有污染排放权交易能缓解碳交易的负面影响，碳交易与用能权交易结合会抑制财务绩效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决以往实证研究中因时变处理和多重处理导致的偏差问题，探究中国多重环境市场在交错重叠实施阶段的边际效应和交互影响。

Method: 采用动态控制组设计，结合差分法(DiD)和人工反事实(ArCo)实证策略，使用2000-2024年A股上市公司面板数据。

Result: 现有污染排放权交易能缓解碳交易负面影响；碳交易与用能权交易结合会抑制财务绩效；在已有碳或污染市场的地区增加用能权或绿电交易无显著影响。

Conclusion: 多重环境市场存在复杂交互效应，政策制定需考虑市场间的协同关系，避免负面叠加影响。

Abstract: To address the dual environmental challenges of pollution and climate change,
China has established multiple environmental markets, including pollution
emissions trading, carbon emissions trading, energy-use rights trading, and
green electricity trading. Previous empirical studies suffer from known biases
arising from time-varying treatment and multiple treatments. To address these
limitations, this study adopts a dynamic control group design and combines
Difference-in-Difference (DiD) and Artificial Counterfactual (ArCo) empirical
strategies. Using panel data on A-share listed companies from 2000 to 2024,
this study investigates the marginal effects and interactive impacts of
multiple environmental markets implemented in staggered and overlapping phases.
Existing pollution emissions trading mitigates the negative effects of carbon
emission trading. Carbon trading suppresses (improves) financial performance
(if implemented alongside energy-use rights trading). The addition of
energy-use rights or green electricity trading in regions already covered by
carbon or pollution markets has no significant effects.

### [154] ["Rich-Get-Richer"? Analyzing Content Creator Earnings Across Large Social Media Platforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26523)
*Ilan Strauss,Jangho Yang,Mariana Mazzucato*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: 研究发现创作者月收入遵循幂律分布，幂律指数约为2，表明算法系统产生类似资本收入的高度不平等分配，而非劳动收入分配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究创作者收入是否遵循幂律分布，以及算法推荐系统如何影响收入不平等。

Method: 使用Patreon平台2018、2021和2024年的创作者收入数据，分析Instagram、Twitch、YouTube、Twitter、Facebook和Patreon等平台的收入分布。

Result: 所有平台都显示幂律分布特征，指数α≈2。Instagram和YouTube等强推荐系统平台幂律关系更强（α更低），中位数和四分位数收入更低，表明算法更偏向顶级创作者。Twitter和Patreon的α值更温和，收入不平等程度较低。

Conclusion: 算法推荐系统加剧了创作者收入不平等。政策应鼓励算法推广长尾内容，以创建更公平和可持续的创作者生态系统。

Abstract: This paper examines whether monthly content creator earnings follow a power
law distribution, driven by compounding 'rich-get-richer' dynamics (Barabasi
and Albert 1999). Patreon creator earnings data for 2018, 2021, and 2024 for
Instagram, Twitch, YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, and Patreon exhibit a power law
exponent around $\alpha = 2$. This suggests that algorithmic systems generate
unequalizing returns closer to highly concentrated capital income and wealth,
rather than labor income. Platforms governed by powerful and compounding
recommendation systems, such as Instagram and YouTube, exhibit both a stronger
power law relation (lower $\alpha$) and lower mean, median, and interquartile
earnings, indicating algorithms that disproportionately favor top earners at
the expense of a 'middle class' of creators. In contrast, Twitter and Patreon
have a more moderate $\alpha$, with less earnings inequality and higher middle
class earnings. Policies which incentivize the algorithmic promotion of
longer-tail content (to explore more and exploit less) may help creator
ecosystems become more equitable and sustainable.

*Arega Getaneh Abate,Salim Hassi,Dogan Keles,Xiufeng Liu,Xiao-Bing Zhang*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: 研究开发了一个储能运营商战略竞价的Cournot竞争模型，分析在可再生能源主导的电力系统中储能对市场绩效的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着电力系统向完全可再生能源转型，储能对于平衡间歇性和确保可靠性变得不可或缺。由于可再生能源边际成本接近零，当可再生能源供应无法满足需求时，储能运营商可以显著影响电价和能源安全。

Method: 开发了Cournot竞争模型，储能运营商战略性地投标数量以最大化利润。提出了使用大M法和连续变量重构的混合整数线性规划模型，包含需求块。使用对角化算法求解战略竞价博弈，并以社会规划者问题作为基准。

Result: 应用丹麦电力系统的结果显示，储能运营商通过低高价格时段套利影响市场绩效，可以平滑供需失衡，相比无储能情况改善福利。但在有限竞争下，战略扣留会提高价格并降低福利，而超过某一点的储能容量扩张不会带来进一步收益。随着企业数量增加，竞争减轻了扭曲，结果向仅有2-3个战略参与者的社会规划者基准收敛。

Conclusion: 这些发现突显了储能在稳定市场和创造市场力量方面的双重作用，强调了需要设计能够将运营商激励与社会福利对齐的市场机制。

Abstract: The transition to electricity systems powered entirely by renewable energy
sources makes energy storage indispensable for balancing intermittency and
ensuring reliability. Since RES operate at near-zero marginal cost, storage
operators can strongly influence electricity prices and energy security when
renewable supply alone cannot meet demand. We develop a Cournot competition
model in which storage operators strategically bid quantities to maximize their
profits. We propose a MILP model with the big-M method and reformulation using
continuous variables, incorporating demand blocks. The strategic bidding game
is solved using the diagonalization algorithm, and the social planner's problem
is used for benchmarking, cast as a one-shot optimization. The proposed model
is applied to Denmark's power system using current data and 2030 renewable
projections, capturing both current and future market conditions. Results show
that storage operators affect market performance by arbitrage between low-and
high-price periods, which can smooth supply-demand imbalances, thereby
improving welfare relative to the no-storage case. With limited competition,
however, strategic withholding increases prices and reduces welfare, while
expanding storage capacity beyond a certain point yields no further gains. As
the number of firms increases, competition mitigates distortions, and outcomes
converge toward the social planner's benchmark with only two to three strategic
players. These findings highlight storage's dual role in both stabilizing
markets and creating market power. underscoring the need for market designs
that align operators' incentives with social welfare.

Main category: stat.AP

TL;DR: 本研究使用卫星图像和机器学习方法评估中国和世界银行在非洲发展项目的影响，发现先前研究可能高估了项目效益，中国项目带来的财富增长更大，且项目选址机制存在差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决发展项目评估中的观测偏差问题，因为传统观测估计可能因调整不完整而存在偏差，且社区层面的可靠结果数据稀缺。

Method: 使用卫星图像衍生的机器学习财富指数，结合日间卫星图像和表格协变量，通过逆概率加权估计资助方和部门特定的平均处理效应，并进行固定效应分析。

Result: 中国和世界银行项目均能提高财富水平，中国项目效果更大；世界银行项目选址更可预测，中国项目选址更多受非可见因素驱动。

Conclusion: 卫星图像分析显示先前研究可能高估发展项目效益，不同资助方的项目效果和选址机制存在系统性差异。

Abstract: Debates about whether development projects improve living conditions persist,
partly because observational estimates can be biased by incomplete adjustment
and because reliable outcome data are scarce at the neighborhood level. We
address both issues in a continent-scale, sector-specific evaluation of Chinese
and World Bank projects across 9,899 neighborhoods in 36 African countries
(2002 to 2013), representative of 88% of the population. First, we use a recent
dataset that measures living conditions with a machine-learned wealth index
derived from contemporaneous satellite imagery, yielding a consistent panel of
6.7 km square mosaics. Second, to strengthen identification, we proxy
officials' map-based placement criteria using pre-treatment daytime satellite
images and fuse these with rich tabular covariates to estimate funder- and
sector-specific ATEs via inverse-probability weighting. Incorporating imagery
systematically shrinks effects relative to tabular-only models, indicating
prior work likely overstated benefits. On average, both donors raise wealth,
with larger gains for China; sector extremes in our sample include Trade and
Tourism for the World Bank (+6.27 IWI points), and Emergency Response for China
(+14.32). Assignment-mechanism analyses show World Bank placement is generally
more predictable from imagery alone, as well as from tabular covariates. This
suggests that Chinese project placements are more driven by non-visible,
political, or event-driven factors than World Bank placements. To probe
residual concerns about selection on observables, we also estimate
within-neighborhood (unit) fixed-effects models at a spatial resolution about
450 times finer than prior fixed effects analyses, leveraging the
computer-vision-imputed IWI panels; these deliver smaller but directionally
consistent effects.

TL;DR: 本文扩展了wgsLR模型，允许对两个样本使用不同的基因分型错误概率，并能整合未知的错误概率。模型对过度分散具有鲁棒性，且整合未知错误概率时在不同假设下得到一致的证据权重。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DNA鸟枪测序证据在法医遗传学中日益重要，需要正确解释此类证据的方法，包括适当考虑测序错误。现有wgsLR模型假设两个样本具有相同的已知基因分型错误概率，但实际中可能不同（如毛发样本和口腔拭子参考样本）。

Method: 扩展wgsLR模型，允许两个样本具有不同的基因分型错误概率，并能整合未知的错误概率（当只知道先验概率时）。研究了模型对过度分散的敏感性。

Result: 模型对估计基因分型错误概率时的过度分散非常鲁棒。整合未知的追踪样本基因分型错误概率时，在两个假设下（同一捐赠者vs不同捐赠者）得到一致的证据权重。使用均值过小的先验分布比均值过大的更保守。

Conclusion: 扩展的wgsLR模型能更灵活地处理实际法医案例中不同样本类型的基因分型错误概率差异，提高了证据解释的准确性。模型已在R包wgsLR中实现。

Abstract: DNA shotgun sequencing evidence is starting to gain a lot of attraction in
forensic genetics. Methods to correctly interpret such evidence, including
properly accounting for sequencing errors, are needed. This paper extends the
wgsLR model by Andersen et. al. (2025) from only allowing for the same, known
genotyping error probability for the two samples (trace sample from unknown
donor and reference sample from person of interest), to allowing for different
genotyping error probabilities (e.g., from trace hair sample and buccal swab
reference sample). The model was also extended to be able to integrate out
unknown genotyping error probabilities if only a prior probability is known.
The sensitivity of the model against overdispersion was also investigated and
it was found that it is very robust against overdispersion in estimating the
genotyping error probability. It was also found that integrating out unknown
genotyping error probability of the trace sample gave concordant weight of
evidence under both the hypotheses (first hypothesis that the same individual
was the donor of both trace and reference sample as well as the second
hypothesis that two different individuals were the donors for the trace and
reference sample). It was found that it is more consevative to use prior
distributions with a too small mean rather than a too high mean. The extension
of the model is implemented in the R package wgsLR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在结构健康监测中，损伤敏感特征不仅受损伤影响，还受环境条件和操作参数等混杂因素影响。这些因素会影响特征的均值和协方差，而协方差是许多损伤检测工具的重要基础。

Method: 使用非参数核方法来估计条件协方差矩阵，允许协方差矩阵根据识别的混杂因素变化。提出了两种基于bootstrap的方法来获得条件协方差的置信区间。

Result: 通过蒙特卡洛研究比较了两种bootstrap版本的有效性，并将方法应用于比利时Leuven附近的KW51铁路桥梁的自然频率数据。

Conclusion: 准确考虑混杂因素可以生成更可靠的诊断值，减少误报。提出的方法在实际应用中显示出重要性。

Abstract: In structural health monitoring (SHM), sensor measurements are collected, and
damage-sensitive features such as natural frequencies are extracted for damage
detection. However, these features depend not only on damage but are also
influenced by various confounding factors, including environmental conditions
and operational parameters. These factors must be identified, and their effects
must be removed before further analysis. However, it has been shown that
confounding variables may influence the mean and the covariance of the
extracted features. This is particularly significant since the covariance is an
essential building block in many damage detection tools. To account for the
complex relationships resulting from the confounding factors, a nonparametric
kernel approach can be used to estimate a conditional covariance matrix. By
doing so, the covariance matrix is allowed to change depending on the
identified confounding factor, thus providing a clearer understanding of how,
for example, temperature influences the extracted features. This paper presents
two bootstrap-based methods for obtaining confidence intervals for the
conditional covariances, providing a way to quantify the uncertainty associated
with the conditional covariance estimator. A proof-of-concept Monte Carlo study
compares the two bootstrap versions proposed and evaluates their effectiveness.
Finally, the methods are applied to the natural frequency data of the KW51
railway bridge near Leuven, Belgium. This real-world application highlights the
practical implications of the findings. It underscores the importance of
accurately accounting for confounding factors to generate more reliable
diagnostic values with fewer false alarms.

TL;DR: BEV-VLM是一个用于自动驾驶轨迹规划的新框架，它使用鸟瞰图特征作为视觉语言模型的视觉输入，相比传统方法在nuScenes数据集上实现了44.8%的规划精度提升和完全避碰。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法仅依赖原始视觉数据如相机图像，而BEV-VLM利用高度压缩且信息丰富的BEV表示，这些表示通过融合多模态传感器数据并与高清地图对齐生成，为轨迹规划提供几何一致且丰富的场景描述。

Method: 该方法使用BEV特征图作为视觉语言模型的视觉输入，通过融合相机和LiDAR等多模态传感器数据，并与HD地图对齐生成统一的BEV-HD地图格式。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上的实验结果显示，该方法实现了44.8%的规划精度提升，并完全避免了碰撞。

Conclusion: 研究表明视觉语言模型能够有效解释处理过的视觉表示如BEV特征，扩展了它们在轨迹规划中超越原始图像的应用范围。

Abstract: This paper introduces BEV-VLM, a novel framework for trajectory planning in
autonomous driving that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with Bird's-Eye
View (BEV) feature maps as visual inputs. Unlike conventional approaches that
rely solely on raw visual data such as camera images, our method utilizes
highly compressed and informative BEV representations, which are generated by
fusing multi-modal sensor data (e.g., camera and LiDAR) and aligning them with
HD Maps. This unified BEV-HD Map format provides a geometrically consistent and
rich scene description, enabling VLMs to perform accurate trajectory planning.
Experimental results on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate 44.8% improvements in
planning accuracy and complete collision avoidance. Our work highlights that
VLMs can effectively interpret processed visual representations like BEV
features, expanding their applicability beyond raw images in trajectory
planning.

Motivation: 现有运动规划框架在高风险应用中难以提供所需的可预测性和可重复性，从工业环境安全到机器人学习的高质量运动数据集创建都存在挑战。

Method: 开发了SRMP框架，通过搜索基础的运动规划方法生成一致轨迹，提供Python和C++ API，支持与MuJoCo、Sapien等主要模拟器集成，并包含MoveIt!插件。

Conclusion: SRMP填补了现有运动规划工具在可预测性和可重复性方面的不足，为机器人操作提供了可靠的运动规划解决方案。

Abstract: Motion planning is a critical component in any robotic system. Over the
years, powerful tools like the Open Motion Planning Library (OMPL) have been
developed, offering numerous motion planning algorithms. However, existing
frameworks often struggle to deliver the level of predictability and
repeatability demanded by high-stakes applications -- ranging from ensuring
safety in industrial environments to the creation of high-quality motion
datasets for robot learning. Complementing existing tools, we introduce SRMP
(Search-based Robot Motion Planning), a new software framework tailored for
robotic manipulation. SRMP distinguishes itself by generating consistent and
reliable trajectories, and is the first software tool to offer motion planning
algorithms for multi-robot manipulation tasks. SRMP easily integrates with
major simulators, including MuJoCo, Sapien, Genesis, and PyBullet via a Python
and C++ API. SRMP includes a dedicated MoveIt! plugin that enables immediate
deployment on robot hardware and seamless integration with existing pipelines.
Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate in this paper that SRMP not only
meets the rigorous demands of industrial and safety-critical applications but
also sets a new standard for consistency in motion planning across diverse
robotic systems. Visit srmp.readthedocs.io for SRMP documentation and

Conclusion: 奖励建模是实现可扩展、注释高效且稳健的长时程操作模仿学习的关键推动因素。

Abstract: Large-scale robot learning has recently shown promise for enabling robots to
perform complex tasks by integrating perception, control, and language
understanding. Yet, it struggles with long-horizon, contact-rich manipulation
such as deformable object handling, where demonstration quality is
inconsistent. Reward modeling offers a natural solution: by providing grounded
progress signals, it transforms noisy demonstrations into stable supervision
that generalizes across diverse trajectories. We introduce a stage-aware,
video-based reward modeling framework that jointly predicts high-level task
stages and fine-grained progress. Reward labels are automatically derived from
natural language subtask annotations, ensuring consistent progress estimation
across variable-length demonstrations. This design overcomes frame-index
labeling, which fails in variable-duration tasks like folding a T-shirt. Our
reward model demonstrates robustness to variability, generalization to
out-of-distribution settings, and strong utility for policy training. Building
on it, we propose Reward-Aligned Behavior Cloning (RA-BC), which filters
high-quality data and reweights samples by reward. Experiments show the reward
model alone outperforms baselines on validation and real robot rollouts.
Integrated into RA-BC, our approach achieves 83\% success on folding T-shirts
from the flattened state and 67\% from the crumpled state -- far surpassing
vanilla behavior cloning, which attains only 8\% and 0\% success. Overall, our
results highlight reward modeling as a key enabler for scalable,
annotation-efficient, and robust imitation learning in long-horizon
manipulation.

*Hanlan Yang,Itamar Mishani,Luca Pivetti,Zachary Kingston,Maxim Likhachev*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出P-ACHS算法，一种基于Actor-Critic架构的并行最佳优先搜索方法，用于提升深度强化学习在机器人任务中的推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Actor-Critic模型部署策略相对简单，通常仅依赖直接的动作策略展开，缺乏更高效的推理方法。

Method: 利用Actor-Critic架构的两个组件：Actor网络生成动作，Critic网络提供成本估计来指导搜索。采用两层并行化：动作和成本估计批量生成，图扩展在多线程中分布。

Result: 在机器人操作任务中验证了方法的有效性，包括无碰撞运动规划和接触丰富的非抓取推动任务。

Conclusion: P-ACHS算法通过并行最佳优先搜索显著提升了Actor-Critic模型在机器人学习任务中的推理效率。

Abstract: Actor-Critic models are a class of model-free deep reinforcement learning
(RL) algorithms that have demonstrated effectiveness across various robot
learning tasks. While considerable research has focused on improving training
stability and data sampling efficiency, most deployment strategies have
remained relatively simplistic, typically relying on direct actor policy
rollouts. In contrast, we propose \pachs{} (\textit{P}arallel
\textit{A}ctor-\textit{C}ritic \textit{H}euristic \textit{S}earch), an
efficient parallel best-first search algorithm for inference that leverages
both components of the actor-critic architecture: the actor network generates
actions, while the critic network provides cost-to-go estimates to guide the
search. Two levels of parallelism are employed within the search -- actions and
cost-to-go estimates are generated in batches by the actor and critic networks
respectively, and graph expansion is distributed across multiple threads. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in robotic manipulation tasks,
including collision-free motion planning and contact-rich interactions such as
non-prehensile pushing. Visit p-achs.github.io for demonstrations and examples.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于人类运动数据的学习控制方法缺乏力数据，位置控制难以实现与真实环境的适当合规交互。

Method: 两阶段双智能体强化学习框架：先训练基于位置控制的基础策略，然后在蒸馏阶段将上半身策略与模型合规控制结合，下半身由基础策略指导。

Result: 在仿真中验证了策略可行性，主要比较了不同合规设置下对外部扰动的响应。

Conclusion: CoTaP框架能够有效整合合规信息，确保系统稳定性，为人形机器人提供更好的环境交互能力。

Abstract: Humanoid whole-body locomotion control is a critical approach for humanoid
robots to leverage their inherent advantages. Learning-based control methods
derived from retargeted human motion data provide an effective means of
addressing this issue. However, because most current human datasets lack
measured force data, and learning-based robot control is largely
position-based, achieving appropriate compliance during interaction with real
environments remains challenging. This paper presents Compliant Task Pipeline
(CoTaP): a pipeline that leverages compliance information in the learning-based
structure of humanoid robots. A two-stage dual-agent reinforcement learning
framework combined with model-based compliance control for humanoid robots is
proposed. In the training process, first a base policy with a position-based
controller is trained; then in the distillation, the upper-body policy is
combined with model-based compliance control, and the lower-body agent is
guided by the base policy. In the upper-body control, adjustable task-space
compliance can be specified and integrated with other controllers through
compliance modulation on the symmetric positive definite (SPD) manifold,
ensuring system stability. We validated the feasibility of the proposed
strategy in simulation, primarily comparing the responses to external
disturbances under different compliance settings.

Method: 在配备双前摄像头和LiDAR传感器的校园高尔夫球车上部署SemVecMap模型，通过校园特定数据微调，实现增量地图生成和更新。

Result: 系统能够准确预测地图并支持持续更新，在真实自动驾驶场景中展示了实用价值。

Conclusion: 提出的在线地图生成系统解决了传统高清地图的局限性，为动态环境下的自动驾驶提供了可行的地图解决方案。

Abstract: High-definition (HD) maps are essential for autonomous driving, providing
precise information such as road boundaries, lane dividers, and crosswalks to
enable safe and accurate navigation. However, traditional HD map generation is
labor-intensive, expensive, and difficult to maintain in dynamic environments.
To overcome these challenges, we present a real-world deployment of an online
mapping system on a campus golf cart platform equipped with dual front cameras
and a LiDAR sensor. Our work tackles three core challenges: (1) labeling a 3D
HD map for campus environment; (2) integrating and generalizing the SemVecMap
model onboard; and (3) incrementally generating and updating the predicted HD
map to capture environmental changes. By fine-tuning with campus-specific data,
our pipeline produces accurate map predictions and supports continual updates,
demonstrating its practical value in real-world autonomous driving scenarios.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了ESL策略用于多机器人多队列系统的在线任务分配，该策略在当前位置非空时进行穷尽服务，空闲时切换到最长未占用的非空位置，并被证明是最优策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多机器人多队列系统中存在随机到达和切换延迟的在线任务分配问题，旨在找到简单有效的实时调度策略。

Method: 建立折扣成本马尔可夫决策过程，提出ESL策略：当前位置非空时穷尽服务，空闲时切换到最长未占用的非空位置。与固定驻留循环策略和先到先服务策略进行比较。

Result: 在不同服务器-位置比例和负载下，ESL始终产生更低的折扣持有成本和更小的平均队列长度，行动时间分数显示更多服务和受限的切换。

Conclusion: ESL策略的简单性和鲁棒性使其成为实时多机器人调度系统的实用默认选择。

Abstract: We study online task allocation for multi-robot, multi-queue systems with
stochastic arrivals and switching delays. Time is slotted; each location can
host at most one robot per slot; service consumes one slot; switching between
locations incurs a one-slot travel delay; and arrivals are independent
Bernoulli processes. We formulate a discounted-cost Markov decision process and
propose Exhaustive-Serve-Longest (ESL), a simple real-time policy that serves
exhaustively when the current location is nonempty and, when idle, switches to
a longest unoccupied nonempty location, and we prove the optimality of this
policy. As baselines, we tune a fixed-dwell cyclic policy via a discrete-time
delay expression and implement a first-come-first-serve policy. Across
server-to-location ratios and loads, ESL consistently yields lower discounted
holding cost and smaller mean queue lengths, with action-time fractions showing
more serving and restrained switching. Its simplicity and robustness make ESL a
practical default for real-time multi-robot scheduling systems.

Motivation: RGB视觉系统难以区分同类地形中的内部差异（如水分含量），而近红外光谱能提供有用信息，但准确分析依赖于环境光照条件。

Method: 开发了系统架构来收集和配准多波长高光谱图像，并描述了在变化光照条件下对相机进行反射率校准的方法。

Result: 展示了从移动机器人平台计算植被健康指数和土壤水分含量的实际应用能力。

Conclusion: HYPER DRIVE系统能够有效利用多波长高光谱信息，在移动机器人平台上实现地形内部特性的准确识别和分析。

Abstract: Intra-class terrain differences such as water content directly influence a
vehicle's ability to traverse terrain, yet RGB vision systems may fail to
distinguish these properties. Evaluating a terrain's spectral content beyond
red-green-blue wavelengths to the near infrared spectrum provides useful
information for intra-class identification. However, accurate analysis of this
spectral information is highly dependent on ambient illumination. We
demonstrate a system architecture to collect and register multi-wavelength,
hyperspectral images from a mobile robot and describe an approach to
reflectance calibrate cameras under varying illumination conditions. To
showcase the practical applications of our system, HYPER DRIVE, we demonstrate
the ability to calculate vegetative health indices and soil moisture content
from a mobile robot platform.

TL;DR: dVLA是一个基于扩散的视觉-语言-动作模型，通过多模态思维链统一视觉感知、语言推理和机器人控制，在单一扩散目标下联合优化，实现了更好的跨模态推理和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉-语言-动作模型正在成为下一代机器人范式，需要统一视觉感知、语言理解和机器人控制，提升跨模态推理能力和对新颖指令及物体的泛化性能。

Method: 采用扩散基础框架，结合多模态思维链，在单一扩散目标下联合优化感知、语言理解和动作。为实际部署引入前缀注意力掩码和KV缓存两种加速策略。

Result: 在LIBERO基准测试中达到96.4%的平均成功率，超越离散和连续动作策略；在真实Franka机器人上成功完成多样化任务，包括需要多步规划的挑战性分拣任务。

Conclusion: 统一的扩散框架为实用高性能VLA机器人技术展现了良好前景，证明了单一扩散目标下联合优化的有效性。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are emerging as a next-generation
paradigm for robotics. We introduce dVLA, a diffusion-based VLA that leverages
a multimodal chain-of-thought to unify visual perception, language reasoning,
and robotic control in a single system. dVLA jointly optimizes perception,
language understanding, and action under a single diffusion objective, enabling
stronger cross-modal reasoning and better generalization to novel instructions
and objects. For practical deployment, we mitigate inference latency by
incorporating two acceleration strategies, a prefix attention mask and KV
caching, yielding up to around times speedup at test-time inference. We
evaluate dVLA in both simulation and the real world: on the LIBERO benchmark,
it achieves state-of-the-art performance with a 96.4% average success rate,
consistently surpassing both discrete and continuous action policies; on a real
Franka robot, it succeeds across a diverse task suite, including a challenging
bin-picking task that requires multi-step planning, demonstrating robust
real-world performance. Together, these results underscore the promise of
unified diffusion frameworks for practical, high-performance VLA robotics.

TL;DR: 提出了一种分层扩散规划器，将任务和运动结构直接嵌入噪声模型中，使用任务条件化的结构化高斯噪声替代标准各向同性高斯噪声，提高了规划成功率和轨迹质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准扩散规划器使用零均值各向同性高斯噪声，忽略了任务和运动结构信息。本文旨在通过将任务条件化的结构直接嵌入噪声模型来改进扩散规划性能。

Method: 1) 将扩散过程推广到有偏非各向同性噪声；2) 分层设计：上层实例化任务条件化结构化高斯（均值和协方差），下层在该固定先验下对完整轨迹去噪；3) 从GPMP中推导均值和协方差。

Result: 在Maze2D目标到达和KUKA积木堆叠任务中，相比各向同性基线方法，获得了更高的成功率、更平滑的轨迹和更强的任务对齐。消融研究表明显式结构化噪声过程比简单调节神经网络更有益。

Conclusion: 该方法将先验概率质量集中在可行、平滑且语义有意义的轨迹附近，同时保持可处理性，证明了在扩散规划中显式结构化噪声过程的价值。

Abstract: We propose a novel hierarchical diffusion planner that embeds task and motion
structure directly in the noise model. Unlike standard diffusion-based planners
that use zero-mean, isotropic Gaussian noise, we employ a family of
task-conditioned structured Gaussians whose means and covariances are derived
from Gaussian Process Motion Planning (GPMP): sparse, task-centric key states
or their associated timings (or both) are treated as noisy observations to
produce a prior instance. We first generalize the standard diffusion process to
biased, non-isotropic corruption with closed-form forward and posterior
expressions. Building on this, our hierarchy separates prior instantiation from
trajectory denoising: the upper level instantiates a task-conditioned
structured Gaussian (mean and covariance), and the lower level denoises the
full trajectory under that fixed prior. Experiments on Maze2D goal-reaching and
KUKA block stacking show improved success rates, smoother trajectories, and
stronger task alignment compared to isotropic baselines. Ablation studies
indicate that explicitly structuring the corruption process offers benefits
beyond simply conditioning the neural network. Overall, our method concentrates
probability mass of prior near feasible, smooth, and semantically meaningful
trajectories while maintaining tractability. Our project page is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有导航模型在统一处理不同导航范式方面存在不足，导致成功率低和泛化能力有限，需要开发一个能够同时处理多种导航任务的统一框架。

Method: 采用快速-慢速系统设计：快速模块使用短时程视觉上下文生成路径点，慢速模块进行深思熟虑规划；集成大规模通用训练数据集进行多任务联合训练。

Result: 在多个导航基准测试中达到最先进性能，支持高达5Hz的控制频率，在真实世界部署中验证了有效性。

Conclusion: OmniNav为具身导航提供了实用见解，为开发多功能、高泛化能力的机器人智能指明了可扩展路径。

Abstract: Embodied navigation presents a core challenge for intelligent robots,
requiring the comprehension of visual environments, natural language
instructions, and autonomous exploration. Existing models often fall short in
offering a unified solution across diverse navigation paradigms, resulting in
low success rates and limited generalization. We introduce OmniNav, a unified
framework addressing instruct-goal, object-goal, point-goal navigation, and
frontier-based exploration within a single architecture. Our approach features
a lightweight, low-latency policy that accurately predicts continuous-space
waypoints (coordinates and orientations). This policy surpasses action-chunk
methods in precision and supports real-world deployment at control frequencies
up to 5 Hz. Architecturally, OmniNav employs a fast-slow system design: a fast
module generates waypoints using short-horizon visual context and subtasks,
while a slow module performs deliberative planning with long-horizon
observations and candidate frontiers to select subsequent subgoals and
subtasks. This collaboration enhances path efficiency and maintains trajectory
coherence, particularly in exploration and memory-intensive scenarios.
Crucially, we identify that the primary bottleneck isn't merely navigation
policy learning, but a robust understanding of general instructions and
objects. To boost generalization, OmniNav integrates large-scale,
general-purpose training datasets, including those for image captioning and
visual recognition, into a joint multi-task regimen. This significantly
improves success rates and robustness. Extensive experiments confirm OmniNav's
state-of-the-art performance across various navigation benchmarks, with
real-world deployment further validating its efficacy. OmniNav provides
practical insights for embodied navigation, charting a scalable path towards
versatile, highly generalizable robotic intelligence.

Motivation: 强化学习在视觉-语言-动作模型后训练中面临稀疏奖励和训练不稳定的挑战，需要改进训练方法。

Method: 使用动作分块PPO结合行为克隆，将连续动作聚合为块以提高时间一致性，并动态更新演示缓冲区进行辅助训练。

Result: 在MetaWorld基准测试中表现优于监督微调，成功率达到0.93，平均成功步数为42.17。

Conclusion: 证明了强化学习在VLA模型后训练中的可行性，为下游VLA应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising avenue for post-training
vision-language-action (VLA) models, but practical deployment is hindered by
sparse rewards and unstable training. This work mitigates these challenges by
introducing an action chunk based on proximal policy optimization (PPO) with
behavior cloning using self-collected demonstrations. Aggregating consecutive
actions into chunks improves the temporal consistency of the policy and the
density of informative feedback. In addition, an auxiliary behavior cloning
loss is applied with a dynamically updated demonstration buffer that
continually collects high-quality task trials during training. The relative
weight between the action-chunked PPO objective and the self behavior clone
auxiliary loss is adapted online to stabilize the post-training process.
Experiments on the MetaWorld benchmark indicate improved performance over
supervised fine-tuning, achieving a high success rate (0.93) and few steps to
success (42.17). These results demonstrate the viability of RL for VLA
post-training and help lay the groundwork for downstream VLA applications.

Motivation: 多旋翼无人机的能量效率是决定任务范围和持续时间的关键性能指标，需要优化路径规划以最小化能耗。

Method: 基于先前开发的多旋翼第一原理能量动力学模型，研究能量最优路径规划，比较与传统旅行商问题解的差异。

Result: 在大多数情况下（高达95%），能量最优解与最小距离解不同，能量节省平均为1.6%-3.3%，90分位数为3.7%-6.5%，最大可达14.9%。

Conclusion: 能量最优规划的关键不是最小化距离，而是协调垂直和水平运动以提高气动效率，这是优化能耗的关键。

Abstract: Multirotor unmanned aerial vehicle is a prevailing type of aerial robots with
wide real-world applications. The energy efficiency of the robot is a critical
aspect of its performance, determining the range and duration of the missions
that can be performed. This paper studies the energy-optimal planning of the
multirotor, which aims at finding the optimal ordering of waypoints with the
minimum energy consumption for missions in 3D space. The study is performed
based on a previously developed model capturing first-principle energy dynamics
of the multirotor. We found that in majority of the cases (up to 95%) the
solutions of the energy-optimal planning are different from those of the
traditional traveling salesman problem which minimizes the total distance. The
difference can be as high as 14.9%, with the average at 1.6%-3.3% and 90th
percentile at 3.7%-6.5% depending on the range and number of waypoints in the
mission. We then identified and explained the key features of the
minimum-energy order by correlating to the underlying flight energy dynamics.
It is shown that instead of minimizing the distance, coordination of vertical
and horizontal motion to promote aerodynamic efficiency is the key to
optimizing energy consumption.

Conclusion: 这是首个仅通过多指触觉传感实现任意手内姿态精炼的方法，解决了抓取执行中的"最后一英里"挑战。

Abstract: Despite progress in both traditional dexterous grasping pipelines and recent
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) approaches, the grasp execution stage remains
prone to pose inaccuracies, especially in long-horizon tasks, which undermines
overall performance. To address this "last-mile" challenge, we propose
TacRefineNet, a tactile-only framework that achieves fine in-hand pose
refinement of known objects in arbitrary target poses using multi-finger
fingertip sensing. Our method iteratively adjusts the end-effector pose based
on tactile feedback, aligning the object to the desired configuration. We
design a multi-branch policy network that fuses tactile inputs from multiple
fingers along with proprioception to predict precise control updates. To train
this policy, we combine large-scale simulated data from a physics-based tactile
model in MuJoCo with real-world data collected from a physical system.
Comparative experiments show that pretraining on simulated data and fine-tuning
with a small amount of real data significantly improves performance over
simulation-only training. Extensive real-world experiments validate the
effectiveness of the method, achieving millimeter-level grasp accuracy using
only tactile input. To our knowledge, this is the first method to enable
arbitrary in-hand pose refinement via multi-finger tactile sensing alone.

Motivation: 解决端到端学习中感知与控制纠缠导致的sim-to-real迁移难题，通过解耦这两个组件来分别优化学习效率。

Conclusion: 解耦感知与控制从根本上改善了sim-to-real迁移效果，控制策略和动作模式具有跨环境通用性，而感知是领域特定的。

Abstract: Sim-to-real transfer remains a fundamental challenge in robot manipulation
due to the entanglement of perception and control in end-to-end learning. We
present a decoupled framework that learns each component where it is most
reliable: control policies are trained in simulation with privileged state to
master spatial layouts and manipulation dynamics, while perception is adapted
only at deployment to bridge real observations to the frozen control policy.
Our key insight is that control strategies and action patterns are universal
across environments and can be learned in simulation through systematic
randomization, while perception is inherently domain-specific and must be
learned where visual observations are authentic. Unlike existing end-to-end
approaches that require extensive real-world data, our method achieves strong
performance with only 10-20 real demonstrations by reducing the complex
sim-to-real problem to a structured perception alignment task. We validate our
approach on tabletop manipulation tasks, demonstrating superior data efficiency
and out-of-distribution generalization compared to end-to-end baselines. The
learned policies successfully handle object positions and scales beyond the
training distribution, confirming that decoupling perception from control
fundamentally improves sim-to-real transfer.

Conclusion: 通过借鉴现代序列模型的原理，成功解决了流策略的训练稳定性问题，支持从零开始和离线到在线学习。

Abstract: Training expressive flow-based policies with off-policy reinforcement
learning is notoriously unstable due to gradient pathologies in the multi-step
action sampling process. We trace this instability to a fundamental connection:
the flow rollout is algebraically equivalent to a residual recurrent
computation, making it susceptible to the same vanishing and exploding
gradients as RNNs. To address this, we reparameterize the velocity network
using principles from modern sequential models, introducing two stable
architectures: Flow-G, which incorporates a gated velocity, and Flow-T, which
utilizes a decoded velocity. We then develop a practical SAC-based algorithm,
enabled by a noise-augmented rollout, that facilitates direct end-to-end
training of these policies. Our approach supports both from-scratch and
offline-to-online learning and achieves state-of-the-art performance on
continuous control and robotic manipulation benchmarks, eliminating the need
for common workarounds like policy distillation or surrogate objectives.

Conclusion: DP-AG为连接生物适应性和人工策略学习提供了有前景的一步，通过建模感知和行动之间的动态交互实现了更有效的策略学习。

Abstract: Existing imitation learning methods decouple perception and action, which
overlooks the causal reciprocity between sensory representations and action
execution that humans naturally leverage for adaptive behaviors. To bridge this
gap, we introduce Action--Guided Diffusion Policy (DP--AG), a unified
representation learning that explicitly models a dynamic interplay between
perception and action through probabilistic latent dynamics. DP--AG encodes
latent observations into a Gaussian posterior via variational inference and
evolves them using an action-guided SDE, where the Vector-Jacobian Product
(VJP) of the diffusion policy's noise predictions serves as a structured
stochastic force driving latent updates. To promote bidirectional learning
between perception and action, we introduce a cycle--consistent contrastive
loss that organizes the gradient flow of the noise predictor into a coherent
perception--action loop, enforcing mutually consistent transitions in both
latent updates and action refinements. Theoretically, we derive a variational
lower bound for the action-guided SDE, and prove that the contrastive objective
enhances continuity in both latent and action trajectories. Empirically, DP--AG
significantly outperforms state--of--the--art methods across simulation
benchmarks and real-world UR5 manipulation tasks. As a result, our DP--AG
offers a promising step toward bridging biological adaptability and artificial
policy learning.

TL;DR: FBGA是一种用于机器人轨迹规划的前向-后向算法，能够在满足通用加速度约束的同时，实现高精度和低计算时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么支持任意加速度约束但计算成本高，要么使用保守的框约束来提高计算效率，需要一种既能处理复杂约束又高效的方法。

Method: FBGA通过前向和后向传递在短离散路径段上最大化速度剖面，同时满足用户定义的性能限制，支持复杂的非凸加速度约束。

Result: 在五个赛道和两种车辆类别上的测试表明，FBGA与最优控制基准非常接近（误差0.11%-0.36%），计算速度快三个数量级，即使在粗离散化下也能保持高精度。

Conclusion: FBGA适用于在线多查询轨迹规划，其开源C++实现已发布。

Abstract: The computation of time-optimal velocity profiles along prescribed paths,
subject to generic acceleration constraints, is a crucial problem in robot
trajectory planning, with particular relevance to autonomous racing. However,
the existing methods either support arbitrary acceleration constraints at high
computational cost or use conservative box constraints for computational
efficiency. We propose FBGA, a new \underline{F}orward-\underline{B}ackward
algorithm with \underline{G}eneric \underline{A}cceleration constraints, which
achieves both high accuracy and low computation time. FBGA operates forward and
backward passes to maximize the velocity profile in short, discretized path
segments, while satisfying user-defined performance limits. Tested on five
racetracks and two vehicle classes, FBGA handles complex, non-convex
acceleration constraints with custom formulations. Its maneuvers and lap times
closely match optimal control baselines (within $0.11\%$-$0.36\%$), while being
up to three orders of magnitude faster. FBGA maintains high accuracy even with
coarse discretization, making it well-suited for online multi-query trajectory
planning. Our open-source \texttt{C++} implementation is available at:

TL;DR: REVER框架通过训练RoboFarseer视觉语言模型，解决了机器人从自由形式语言指令执行长时程操作任务的两个关键问题：缺乏大规模序列操作数据和密集可解释奖励。该模型能够生成和验证物理可行、逻辑连贯的操作计划，在真实世界任务中显著提升成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器人从自然语言指令执行长时程操作任务的两个主要障碍：(i) 缺乏结合自然语言与多步动作计划的大规模序列操作数据；(ii) 缺乏用于微调视觉语言模型规划目标的密集可解释奖励。

Method: 提出REVER框架，训练RoboFarseer视觉语言模型进行时空推理，生成链式思维。利用通用操作接口框架捕获原子技能演示，通过自动标注引擎生成视觉-指令-计划三元组。引入可验证奖励，通过有序二分匹配评估生成计划与真实技能序列的重叠度。

Conclusion: REVER框架成功解决了机器人长时程操作任务中的关键挑战，通过可验证的奖励机制和自动数据生成方法，显著提升了视觉语言模型在真实世界场景中的规划能力。

Abstract: Enabling robots to execute long-horizon manipulation tasks from free-form
language instructions remains a fundamental challenge in embodied AI. While
vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise as high-level planners, their
deployment in the real world is hindered by two gaps: (i) the scarcity of
large-scale, sequential manipulation data that couples natural language with
multi-step action plans, and (ii) the absence of dense, interpretable rewards
for fine-tuning VLMs on planning objectives. To address these issues, we
propose REVER, a framework that empowers VLMs to generate and validate
long-horizon manipulation plans from natural language instructions in
real-world scenarios. Under REVER we train and release RoboFarseer, a VLM
incentivized to emit chain-of-thought that perform temporal and spatial
reasoning, ensuring physically plausible and logically coherent plans. To
obtain training data, we leverage the Universal Manipulation Interface
framework to capture hardware-agnostic demonstrations of atomic skills. An
automated annotation engine converts each demonstration into
vision-instruction-plan triplet. We introduce a verifiable reward that scores
the generated plan by its ordered bipartite matching overlap with the
ground-truth skill sequence. At run time, the fine-tuned VLM functions both as
a planner and as a monitor, verifying step-wise completion. RoboFarseer matches
or exceeds the performance of proprietary models that are orders of magnitude
larger, while on open-ended planning it surpasses the best baseline by more
than 40%. In real-world, long-horizon tasks, the complete system boosts overall
success by roughly 60% compared with the same low-level controller without the
planner. We will open-source both the dataset and the trained model upon
publication.

TL;DR: OmniRetarget是一个基于交互网格的运动重定向系统，能够保留人机交互关系，生成高质量的机器人运动轨迹，用于训练强化学习策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有运动重定向方法在人体与机器人之间存在显著体型差异时产生的物理不合理现象（如脚部滑动、穿透），并保留重要的人-物和人-环境交互关系。

Method: 使用交互网格显式建模并保留智能体、地形和操作对象之间的空间和接触关系，通过最小化人体和机器人网格之间的拉普拉斯变形并施加运动学约束来生成运动学可行的轨迹。

Result: 从多个运动捕捉数据集生成了超过8小时的轨迹，在运动学约束满足和接触保持方面优于广泛使用的基线方法，使本体感知RL策略能够在Unitree G1人形机器人上成功执行长达30秒的跑酷和移动操作技能。

Conclusion: OmniRetarget能够生成高质量的运动数据，支持高效的强化学习训练，仅需少量奖励项和简单的领域随机化即可实现复杂技能的掌握。

Abstract: A dominant paradigm for teaching humanoid robots complex skills is to
retarget human motions as kinematic references to train reinforcement learning
(RL) policies. However, existing retargeting pipelines often struggle with the
significant embodiment gap between humans and robots, producing physically
implausible artifacts like foot-skating and penetration. More importantly,
common retargeting methods neglect the rich human-object and human-environment
interactions essential for expressive locomotion and loco-manipulation. To
address this, we introduce OmniRetarget, an interaction-preserving data
generation engine based on an interaction mesh that explicitly models and
preserves the crucial spatial and contact relationships between an agent, the
terrain, and manipulated objects. By minimizing the Laplacian deformation
between the human and robot meshes while enforcing kinematic constraints,
OmniRetarget generates kinematically feasible trajectories. Moreover,
preserving task-relevant interactions enables efficient data augmentation, from
a single demonstration to different robot embodiments, terrains, and object
configurations. We comprehensively evaluate OmniRetarget by retargeting motions
from OMOMO, LAFAN1, and our in-house MoCap datasets, generating over 8-hour
trajectories that achieve better kinematic constraint satisfaction and contact
preservation than widely used baselines. Such high-quality data enables
proprioceptive RL policies to successfully execute long-horizon (up to 30
seconds) parkour and loco-manipulation skills on a Unitree G1 humanoid, trained
with only 5 reward terms and simple domain randomization shared by all tasks,
without any learning curriculum.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 柔顺性机器人在不确定场景中具有鲁棒性，但由于缺乏刚体假设和形态变化导致的运动学变化，其状态估计具有挑战性。

Method: 使用基于神经网络的状态估计器，结合状态历史记录和直接影响不可靠传感器的机制，在考虑形态相关状态的柔顺中心坐标系中训练网络。

Result: 预测形状相关测量误差在机器人尺寸的4.2%以内，线速度和角速度误差分别在最高速度的6.3%和2.4%以内，方向误差在1.5度以内，在电机故障时使用该估计器可实现300%的行程范围增加。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效估计柔顺机器人的状态，显著提高了在极端户外地形中的自主操作性能。

Abstract: Locomotion robots with active or passive compliance can show robustness to
uncertain scenarios, which can be promising for agricultural, research and
environmental industries. However, state estimation for these robots is
challenging due to the lack of rigid-body assumptions and kinematic changes
from morphing. We propose a method to estimate typical rigid-body states
alongside compliance-related states, such as soft robot shape in different
morphologies and locomotion modes. Our neural network-based state estimator
uses a history of states and a mechanism to directly influence unreliable
sensors. We test our framework on the GOAT platform, a robot capable of passive
compliance and active morphing for extreme outdoor terrain. The network is
trained on motion capture data in a novel compliance-centric frame that
accounts for morphing-related states. Our method predicts shape-related
measurements within 4.2% of the robot's size, velocities within 6.3% and 2.4%
of the top linear and angular speeds, respectively, and orientation within 1.5
degrees. We also demonstrate a 300% increase in travel range during a motor
malfunction when using our estimator for closed-loop autonomous outdoor
operation.

Motivation: 传统人机交互界面依赖面板或手持设备，无法实现无缝的嵌入式交互，存在人类意图与机器人响应之间的差距。

Method: 开发了编织触觉皮肤，结合织物柔韧性和结构稳定性，通过交织导电线程实现密集多通道传感；定义了14种单点和多点触控手势映射；设计了轻量级卷积-Transformer模型进行实时手势识别。

Conclusion: 该框架为实现更自然高效的嵌入式人机交互提供了实用途径。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel human-robot interaction (HRI) framework that
enables intuitive gesture-driven control through a capacitance-based woven
tactile skin. Unlike conventional interfaces that rely on panels or handheld
devices, the woven tactile skin integrates seamlessly with curved robot
surfaces, enabling embodied interaction and narrowing the gap between human
intent and robot response. Its woven design combines fabric-like flexibility
with structural stability and dense multi-channel sensing through the
interlaced conductive threads. Building on this capability, we define a
gesture-action mapping of 14 single- and multi-touch gestures that cover
representative robot commands, including task-space motion and auxiliary
functions. A lightweight convolution-transformer model designed for gesture
recognition in real time achieves an accuracy of near-100%, outperforming prior
baseline approaches. Experiments on robot arm tasks, including pick-and-place
and pouring, demonstrate that our system reduces task completion time by up to
57% compared with keyboard panels and teach pendants. Overall, our proposed
framework demonstrates a practical pathway toward more natural and efficient
embodied HRI.

Motivation: 针对物体导航任务，需要有效整合历史观测信息和空间上下文，从不同质量的演示轨迹中学习稳健的探索策略。

Method: 采用语义地图抽象编码空间上下文，基于当前和历史观测以及语义地图预测动作序列，通过奖励引导的回报建模增强监督，使用三阶段训练流程：地图级空间理解学习、混合质量演示的行为模仿和奖励放大。

Result: 在HM3D和Gibson基准测试中，MUVLA展现出良好的泛化能力，即使从低质量或部分成功的轨迹中也能学习有效的探索行为。

Conclusion: MUVLA通过统一空间表示和奖励放大策略，能够从多样化演示中学习稳健的物体导航能力，在复杂环境中实现有效的目标导向探索。

Abstract: In this paper, we present MUVLA, a Map Understanding Vision-Language-Action
model tailored for object navigation. It leverages semantic map abstractions to
unify and structure historical information, encoding spatial context in a
compact and consistent form. MUVLA takes the current and history observations,
as well as the semantic map, as inputs and predicts the action sequence based
on the description of goal object. Furthermore, it amplifies supervision
through reward-guided return modeling based on dense short-horizon progress
signals, enabling the model to develop a detailed understanding of action value
for reward maximization. MUVLA employs a three-stage training pipeline:
learning map-level spatial understanding, imitating behaviors from
mixed-quality demonstrations, and reward amplification. This strategy allows
MUVLA to unify diverse demonstrations into a robust spatial representation and
generate more rational exploration strategies. Experiments on HM3D and Gibson
benchmarks demonstrate that MUVLA achieves great generalization and learns
effective exploration behaviors even from low-quality or partially successful
trajectories.

Conclusion: 这是首次尝试以互补自监督方式融合雷达频谱和惯性数据实现状态估计的工作。

Abstract: Millimeter-wave radar for state estimation is gaining significant attention
for its affordability and reliability in harsh conditions. Existing
localization solutions typically rely on post-processed radar point clouds as
landmark points. Nonetheless, the inherent sparsity of radar point clouds,
ghost points from multi-path effects, and limited angle resolution in
single-chirp radar severely degrade state estimation performance. To address
these issues, we propose S$^3$E, a \textbf{S}elf-\textbf{S}upervised
\textbf{S}tate \textbf{E}stimator that employs more richly informative radar
signal spectra to bypass sparse points and fuses complementary inertial
information to achieve accurate localization. S$^3$E fully explores the
association between \textit{exteroceptive} radar and \textit{proprioceptive}
inertial sensor to achieve complementary benefits. To deal with limited angle
resolution, we introduce a novel cross-fusion technique that enhances spatial
structure information by exploiting subtle rotational shift correlations across
heterogeneous data. The experimental results demonstrate our method achieves
robust and accurate performance without relying on localization ground truth
supervision. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to achieve
state estimation by fusing radar spectra and inertial data in a complementary
self-supervised manner.

Method: 对22名7-11岁儿童进行试点研究，使用人形机器人QTRobot展示不同表达水平（仅身体、仅面部、身体和面部）的基本情绪（快乐和悲伤），观察儿童在合作轮流游戏中的行为变化。

Result: 儿童会调整自己的行为以匹配机器人推断的情感状态，但更高的表达水平并未导致更强的行为对齐。

Abstract: The growing development of robots with artificial emotional expressiveness
raises important questions about their persuasive potential in children's
behavior. While research highlights the pragmatic value of emotional
expressiveness in human social communication, the extent to which robotic
expressiveness can or should influence empathic responses in children is
grounds for debate. In a pilot study with 22 children (aged 7-11) we begin to
explore the ways in which different levels of embodied expressiveness (body
only, face only, body and face) of two basic emotions (happiness and sadness)
displayed by an anthropomorphic robot (QTRobot) might modify children's
behavior in a child-robot cooperative turn-taking game. We observed that
children aligned their behavior to the robot's inferred emotional state.
However, higher levels of expressiveness did not result in increased alignment.
The preliminary results reported here provide a starting point for reflecting
on robotic expressiveness and its role in shaping children's social-emotional
behavior toward robots as social peers in the near future.

Conclusion: 为处理平面接触提供了数学一致且计算可行的理论基础，对接触动力学精确模拟以及运动和操作中的高级控制算法设计具有重要意义。

Abstract: We present a unifying theoretical result that connects two foundational
principles in robotics: the Signorini law for point contacts, which underpins
many simulation methods for preventing object interpenetration, and the center
of pressure (also known as the zero-moment point), a key concept used in, for
instance, optimization-based locomotion control. Our contribution is the planar
Signorini condition, a conic complementarity formulation that models general
planar contacts between rigid bodies. We prove that this formulation is
equivalent to enforcing the punctual Signorini law across an entire contact
surface, thereby bridging the gap between discrete and continuous contact
models. A geometric interpretation reveals that the framework naturally
captures three physical regimes -sticking, separating, and tilting-within a
unified complementarity structure. This leads to a principled extension of the
classical center of pressure, which we refer to as the extended center of
pressure. By establishing this connection, our work provides a mathematically
consistent and computationally tractable foundation for handling planar
contacts, with implications for both the accurate simulation of contact
dynamics and the design of advanced control and optimization algorithms in
locomotion and manipulation.

Abstract: This paper investigates Multi-Agent Path Finding Among Movable Obstacles
(M-PAMO), which seeks collision-free paths for multiple agents from their start
to goal locations among static and movable obstacles. M-PAMO arises in
logistics and warehouses where mobile robots are among unexpected movable
objects. Although Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) and single-agent Path
planning Among Movable Obstacles (PAMO) were both studied, M-PAMO remains
under-explored. Movable obstacles lead to new fundamental challenges as the
state space, which includes both agents and movable obstacles, grows
exponentially with respect to the number of agents and movable obstacles. In
particular, movable obstacles often closely couple agents together spatially
and temporally. This paper makes a first attempt to adapt and fuse the popular
Conflict-Based Search (CBS) and Prioritized Planning (PP) for MAPF, and a
recent single-agent PAMO planner called PAMO*, together to address M-PAMO. We
compare their performance with up to 20 agents and hundreds of movable
obstacles, and show the pros and cons of these approaches.

Abstract: Humanoid robots have seen significant advancements in both design and
control, with a growing emphasis on integrating these aspects to enhance
overall performance. Traditionally, robot design has followed a sequential
process, where control algorithms are developed after the hardware is
finalized. However, this can be myopic and prevent robots to fully exploit
their hardware capabilities. Recent approaches advocate for co-design,
optimizing both design and control in parallel to maximize robotic
capabilities. This paper presents the Evolutionary Continuous Adaptive RL-based
Co-Design (EA-CoRL) framework, which combines reinforcement learning (RL) with
evolutionary strategies to enable continuous adaptation of the control policy
to the hardware. EA-CoRL comprises two key components: Design Evolution, which
explores the hardware choices using an evolutionary algorithm to identify
efficient configurations, and Policy Continuous Adaptation, which fine-tunes a
task-specific control policy across evolving designs to maximize performance
rewards. We evaluate EA-CoRL by co-designing the actuators (gear ratios) and
control policy of the RH5 humanoid for a highly dynamic chin-up task,
previously unfeasible due to actuator limitations. Comparative results against
state-of-the-art RL-based co-design methods show that EA-CoRL achieves higher
fitness score and broader design space exploration, highlighting the critical
role of continuous policy adaptation in robot co-design.

Abstract: This research presents a multi-robot system for inpatient care, designed
using swarm intelligence principles and incorporating wearable health sensors,

navigation within farms, which requires an accurate, online estimate of the AUV
pose and map of the infrastructure. To enable this, we propose an efficient
side scan sonar-based (SSS) simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM)
framework that exploits the geometry of kelp farms via modeling structural
ropes in the back-end as sequences of individual landmarks from each SSS ping
detection, instead of combining detections into elongated representations. Our
method outperforms state of the art solutions in hardware in the loop (HIL)
experiments on a real AUV survey in a kelp farm. The framework and dataset can
be found at https://github.com/julRusVal/sss_farm_slam.

*Yizhe Liu,Han Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种面向地形感知的LiDAR-惯性里程计框架，使用径向基函数自适应建模地形几何，通过软约束缓解机器人运动时z轴位姿漂移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在非结构化地形（如颠簸路面和楼梯）中运行时，由于忽略地形几何特征，经常出现位姿漂移问题。

Method: 使用径向基函数(RBF)近似地形，自适应选择中心点并递归更新权重，生成平滑地形流形，在里程计优化中施加软约束。通过GPU并行化确保实时性能。

Result: 在非结构化地形上的实验表明，该方法比现有最先进基线方法具有更高的定位精度，特别是在连续高度变化或特征稀疏且发生急剧高度变化的场景中。

Conclusion: 所提出的地形感知LiDAR-惯性里程计框架能有效缓解z轴位姿漂移，在复杂地形环境中提供更准确的定位。

Abstract: An accurate odometry is essential for legged-wheel robots operating in
unstructured terrains such as bumpy roads and staircases. Existing methods
often suffer from pose drift due to their ignorance of terrain geometry. We
propose a terrain-awared LiDAR-Inertial odometry (LIO) framework that
approximates the terrain using Radial Basis Functions (RBF) whose centers are
adaptively selected and weights are recursively updated. The resulting smooth
terrain manifold enables ``soft constraints" that regularize the odometry
optimization and mitigates the $z$-axis pose drift under abrupt elevation
changes during robot's maneuver. To ensure the LIO's real-time performance, we
further evaluate the RBF-related terms and calculate the inverse of the sparse
kernel matrix with GPU parallelization. Experiments on unstructured terrains
demonstrate that our method achieves higher localization accuracy than the
state-of-the-art baselines, especially in the scenarios that have continuous
height changes or sparse features when abrupt height changes occur.

TL;DR: ISyHand是一款低成本、易于制造的开源机器人手，采用关节式手掌设计提高灵巧性，在模拟和真实环境中都表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着人形机器人和定制制造解决方案的快速发展，灵巧操作成为现代机器人学的关键。现有灵巧手要么昂贵，要么在提高灵巧性时牺牲了拟人化特性。

Method: 使用现成的Dynamixel电机、紧固件和3D打印部件，设计具有独特关节式手掌的机器人手，通过强化学习在模拟环境中训练立方体重定向任务。

Conclusion: ISyHand证明了关节式手掌设计能在保持良好拟人化的同时显著提高灵巧性，为低成本灵巧操作研究提供了可行方案。

Abstract: The rapid increase in the development of humanoid robots and customized
manufacturing solutions has brought dexterous manipulation to the forefront of
modern robotics. Over the past decade, several expensive dexterous hands have
come to market, but advances in hardware design, particularly in servo motors
and 3D printing, have recently facilitated an explosion of cheaper open-source
hands. Most hands are anthropomorphic to allow use of standard human tools, and
attempts to increase dexterity often sacrifice anthropomorphism. We introduce
the open-source ISyHand (pronounced easy-hand), a highly dexterous, low-cost,
easy-to-manufacture, on-joint servo-driven robot hand. Our hand uses
off-the-shelf Dynamixel motors, fasteners, and 3D-printed parts, can be
assembled within four hours, and has a total material cost of about 1,300 USD.
The ISyHands's unique articulated-palm design increases overall dexterity with
only a modest sacrifice in anthropomorphism. To demonstrate the utility of the
articulated palm, we use reinforcement learning in simulation to train the hand
to perform a classical in-hand manipulation task: cube reorientation. Our
novel, systematic experiments show that the simulated ISyHand outperforms the
two most comparable hands in early training phases, that all three perform
similarly well after policy convergence, and that the ISyHand significantly
outperforms a fixed-palm version of its own design. Additionally, we deploy a
policy trained on cube reorientation on the real hand, demonstrating its
ability to perform real-world dexterous manipulation.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了基于自编码器的异常检测方法在机器人操作任务中的泛化能力，通过三个工业任务验证了该方法在不同控制策略下的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人操作中的分布外状态常导致不可预测行为或任务失败，需要异常检测来触发安全机制。现有方法在跨任务和控制策略的泛化能力尚未得到验证。

Method: 构建三个工业机器人任务场景，收集多模态时间序列数据，比较多种基于自编码器的异常检测方法在不同控制策略下的表现。

Result: 在布线和拧螺丝任务中实现了AUROC超过0.93的可靠检测，能识别零件错位、目标受阻等故障；在抛光任务中仅能检测严重故障。

Conclusion: 基于自编码器的异常检测方法在特定工业任务中表现良好，但在检测细微故障方面仍有局限，需要进一步改进。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution states in robot manipulation often lead to unpredictable
robot behavior or task failure, limiting success rates and increasing risk of
damage. Anomaly detection (AD) can identify deviations from expected patterns
in data, which can be used to trigger failsafe behaviors and recovery
strategies. Prior work has applied data-driven AD to time series data in
specific robotic tasks, but its transferability across control strategies and
task types has not been shown. Leveraging time series data, such as
force/torque signals, allows to directly capture robot-environment
interactions, crucial for manipulation and online failure detection. Their
broad availability, high sampling rates, and low dimensionality enable high
temporal resolution and efficient processing. As robotic tasks can have widely
signal characteristics and requirements, AD methods which can be applied in the
same way to a wide range of tasks is needed, ideally with good data efficiency.
We examine three industrial robotic tasks, each presenting several anomalies.
Test scenarios in robotic cabling, screwing, and sanding are built, and
multimodal time series data is gathered. Several autoencoder-based methods are
compared, evaluating generalization across tasks and control methods (diffusion
policy, position, and impedance control). This allows us to validate the
integration of AD in complex tasks involving tighter tolerances and variation
from both the robot and its environment. Additionally, we evaluate data
efficiency, detection latency, and task characteristics which support robust
detection. The results indicate reliable detection with AUROC exceeding 0.93 in
failures in the cabling and screwing task, such as incorrect or misaligned
parts and obstructed targets. In the polishing task, only severe failures were
reliably detected, while more subtle failure types remained undetected.

TL;DR: LLM-MCoX是一个利用大语言模型协调多机器人系统进行自主探索和物体搜索的新框架，相比传统方法显著提升了探索效率和搜索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多机器人系统在未知室内环境中的自主探索和物体搜索存在协调不足的问题，贪婪前沿分配策略限制了系统性能。

Method: 结合实时LiDAR扫描处理（前沿聚类和门检测）与多模态LLM推理，基于共享环境地图和机器人状态生成协调的航点分配。

Conclusion: LLM-MCoX通过LLM智能协调显著提升了多机器人系统的探索和搜索性能，实现了传统算法无法处理的语义级人机交互。

Abstract: Autonomous exploration and object search in unknown indoor environments
remain challenging for multi-robot systems (MRS). Traditional approaches often
rely on greedy frontier assignment strategies with limited inter-robot
coordination. In this work, we introduce LLM-MCoX (LLM-based Multi-robot
Coordinated Exploration and Search), a novel framework that leverages Large
Language Models (LLMs) for intelligent coordination of both homogeneous and
heterogeneous robot teams tasked with efficient exploration and target object
search. Our approach combines real-time LiDAR scan processing for frontier
cluster extraction and doorway detection with multimodal LLM reasoning (e.g.,
GPT-4o) to generate coordinated waypoint assignments based on shared
environment maps and robot states. LLM-MCoX demonstrates superior performance
compared to existing methods, including greedy and Voronoi-based planners,
achieving 22.7% faster exploration times and 50% improved search efficiency in
large environments with 6 robots. Notably, LLM-MCoX enables natural
language-based object search capabilities, allowing human operators to provide
high-level semantic guidance that traditional algorithms cannot interpret.

### [194] [Kinodynamic Motion Planning for Mobile Robot Navigation across Inconsistent World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26339)
*Eric R. Damm,Thomas M. Howard*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种在不确定环境中进行运动规划的方法GEGRH，通过跟踪世界模型历史并调整节点成本，解决了障碍物识别不一致的问题，相比现有方法能找到更低成本的轨迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动地面机器人在未知环境中由于传感器噪声和算法限制，难以一致识别障碍物和地形特征，导致成本地图区域在连续规划周期中在障碍物和自由空间之间切换，这使得运动规划系统难以生成安全的运动轨迹。

Method: 提出了三种迭代方法：PEH（为每个跨越世界模型分歧点的节点扩展调用子搜索）、GEH（将子搜索推迟到边扩展到目标区域后）和GEGRH（在GEH基础上增加基于每个世界中分歧节点修订图的步骤）。

Result: GEGRH相比VEH方法能找到更低成本的轨迹且平均规划时间更快；相比单假设搜索，GEGRH生成更保守的规划，平均规划时间略有增加。

Conclusion: GEGRH方法在非结构化越野环境中表现出色，能够有效处理世界模型的不确定性，平衡规划质量和计算效率。

Abstract: Mobile ground robots lacking prior knowledge of an environment must rely on
sensor data to develop a model of their surroundings. In these scenarios,
consistent identification of obstacles and terrain features can be difficult
due to noise and algorithmic shortcomings, which can make it difficult for
motion planning systems to generate safe motions. One particular difficulty to
overcome is when regions of the cost map switch between being marked as
obstacles and free space through successive planning cycles. One potential
solution to this, which we refer to as Valid in Every Hypothesis (VEH), is for
the planning system to plan motions that are guaranteed to be safe through a
history of world models. Another approach is to track a history of world
models, and adjust node costs according to the potential penalty of needing to
reroute around previously hazardous areas. This work discusses three major
iterations on this idea. The first iteration, called PEH, invokes a sub-search
for every node expansion that crosses through a divergence point in the world
models. The second and third iterations, called GEH and GEGRH respectively,
defer the sub-search until after an edge expands into the goal region. GEGRH
uses an additional step to revise the graph based on divergent nodes in each
world. Initial results showed that, although PEH and GEH find more optimistic
solutions than VEH, they are unable to generate solutions in less than
one-second, which exceeds our requirements for field deployment. Analysis of
results from a field experiment in an unstructured, off-road environment on a
Clearpath Robotics Warthog UGV indicate that GEGRH finds lower cost
trajectories and has faster average planning times than VEH. Compared to
single-hypothesis (SH) search, where only the latest world model is considered,
GEGRH generates more conservative plans with a small increase in average
planning time.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SDA-PLANNER是一个用于具身任务规划的新方法，通过状态依赖图和错误自适应重规划机制，解决了现有LLM规划器的固定规划范式、缺乏动作序列约束和错误不可知等限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的具身任务规划方法存在三个主要限制：固定的规划范式、缺乏动作序列约束以及对执行错误的不可知性。为了解决这些问题，需要开发能够自适应规划、考虑状态依赖关系和错误感知的全面规划方法。

Method: SDA-PLANNER引入了状态依赖图来显式建模动作的前置条件和效果，指导动态修订。对于执行错误处理，采用错误自适应重规划策略，包括错误回溯与诊断以及自适应动作子树生成，基于当前环境状态局部重建受影响的部分计划。

Result: 实验表明，SDA-PLANNER在成功率和目标完成度方面持续优于基线方法，特别是在各种错误条件下表现更加出色。

Conclusion: SDA-PLANNER通过自适应规划范式、状态依赖感知和错误感知机制，为具身任务规划提供了全面的解决方案，显著提升了规划性能和对错误的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Embodied task planning requires agents to produce executable actions in a
close-loop manner within the environment. With progressively improving
capabilities of LLMs in task decomposition, planning, and generalization,
current embodied task planning methods adopt LLM-based architecture.However,
existing LLM-based planners remain limited in three aspects, i.e., fixed
planning paradigms, lack of action sequence constraints, and error-agnostic. In
this work, we propose SDA-PLANNER, enabling an adaptive planning paradigm,
state-dependency aware and error-aware mechanisms for comprehensive embodied
task planning. Specifically, SDA-PLANNER introduces a State-Dependency Graph to
explicitly model action preconditions and effects, guiding the dynamic
revision. To handle execution error, it employs an error-adaptive replanning
strategy consisting of Error Backtrack and Diagnosis and Adaptive Action
SubTree Generation, which locally reconstructs the affected portion of the plan
based on the current environment state. Experiments demonstrate that
SDA-PLANNER consistently outperforms baselines in success rate and goal
completion, particularly under diverse error conditions.

TL;DR: 本研究验证了在真实机器人系统中使用旋转解耦方法（unwinding rotations）能有效降低VR晕动症，提高用户舒适度，且不影响任务表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的沉浸式远程临场感系统中，机器人运动会导致VR晕动症，影响用户体验。虽然已有研究表明旋转解耦能提高舒适度，但都是在虚拟环境和模拟机器人中验证的。

Method: 通过用户研究（n=36），比较了旋转解耦方法与耦合旋转方法在真实机器人系统（搭载全景相机的机械臂）中的表现，评估了用户在三维空间中的检查任务表现。

Result: 用户认为旋转解耦方法更舒适、更受青睐，能显著降低VR晕动症水平，且对任务表现没有显著影响。

Conclusion: 在真实机器人系统中应用旋转解耦方法能有效改善用户体验，减少VR晕动症，同时保持任务性能。

Abstract: Immersive telepresence, when a user views the video stream of a $360^\circ$
camera in a remote environment using a Head Mounted Display (HMD), has great
potential to improve the sense of being in a remote environment. In most cases
of immersive robotic telepresence, the camera is mounted on a mobile robot
which increases the portion of the environment that the remote user can
explore. However, robot motions can induce unpleasant symptoms associated with
Virtual Reality (VR) sickness, degrading the overall user experience. Previous
research has shown that unwinding the rotations of the robot, that is,
decoupling the rotations that the camera undergoes due to robot motions from
what is seen by the user, can increase user comfort and reduce VR sickness.
However, that work considered a virtual environment and a simulated robot. In
this work, to test whether the same hypotheses hold when the video stream from
a real camera is used, we carried out a user study $(n=36)$ in which the
unwinding rotations method was compared against coupled rotations in a task
completed through a panoramic camera mounted on a robotic arm. Furthermore,
within an inspection task which involved translations and rotations in three
dimensions, we tested whether unwinding the robot rotations impacted the
performance of users. The results show that the users found the unwinding
rotations method to be more comfortable and preferable, and that a reduced
level of VR sickness can be achieved without a significant impact on task
performance.

Conclusion: 该方法能够高效地在配置优化过程中执行集合的非穿透约束，为碰撞感知轨迹优化等问题提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Optimization-based methods are widely used for computing fast, diverse
solutions for complex tasks such as collision-free movement or planning in the
presence of contacts. However, most of these methods require enforcing
non-penetration constraints between objects, resulting in a non-trivial and
computationally expensive problem. This makes the use of optimization-based
methods for planning and control challenging. In this paper, we present a
method to efficiently enforce non-penetration of sets while performing
optimization over their configuration, which is directly applicable to problems
like collision-aware trajectory optimization. We introduce novel differentiable
conditions with analytic expressions to achieve this. To enforce non-collision
between non-smooth bodies using these conditions, we introduce a method to
approximate polytopes as smooth semi-algebraic sets. We present several
numerical experiments to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method and
compare the performance with other baseline methods recently proposed in the
literature.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成大规模多样的动态障碍物数据集具有挑战性，因为障碍物轨迹空间巨大，传统方法需要昂贵的专家演示或试错探索。

Method: 将幻觉分解为两个阶段：首先识别关键点（障碍物必须出现的时间和位置），然后程序化生成通过这些点且避免碰撞的多样化轨迹。

Result: LfH-CP比现有基线方法产生更多样化的训练数据，仿真实验显示使用LfH-CP数据集训练的运动规划器成功率更高。

Conclusion: LfH-CP框架能有效生成丰富的动态障碍物数据集，避免了生成失败问题，提高了运动规划器的性能。

Abstract: Generating large and diverse obstacle datasets to learn motion planning in
environments with dynamic obstacles is challenging due to the vast space of
possible obstacle trajectories. Inspired by hallucination-based data synthesis
approaches, we propose Learning from Hallucinating Critical Points (LfH-CP), a
self-supervised framework for creating rich dynamic obstacle datasets based on
existing optimal motion plans without requiring expensive expert demonstrations
or trial-and-error exploration. LfH-CP factorizes hallucination into two
stages: first identifying when and where obstacles must appear in order to
result in an optimal motion plan, i.e., the critical points, and then
procedurally generating diverse trajectories that pass through these points
while avoiding collisions. This factorization avoids generative failures such
as mode collapse and ensures coverage of diverse dynamic behaviors. We further
introduce a diversity metric to quantify dataset richness and show that LfH-CP
produces substantially more varied training data than existing baselines.
Experiments in simulation demonstrate that planners trained on LfH-CP datasets
achieves higher success rates compared to a prior hallucination method.

Conclusion: 所提出的树形图表示方法有效解决了机器人群体形状组装中的内存效率问题，在2D和3D场景下都具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Mean-shift-based approaches have recently emerged as the most effective
methods for robot swarm shape assembly tasks. These methods rely on image-based
representations of target shapes to compute local density gradients and perform
mean-shift exploration, which constitute their core mechanism. However, such
image representations incur substantial memory overhead, which can become
prohibitive for high-resolution or 3D shapes. To overcome this limitation, we
propose a memory-efficient tree map representation that hierarchically encodes
user-specified shapes and is applicable to both 2D and 3D scenarios. Building
on this representation, we design a behavior-based distributed controller that
enables assignment-free shape assembly. Comparative 2D and 3D simulations
against a state-of-the-art mean-shift algorithm demonstrate one to two orders
of magnitude lower memory usage and two to three times faster shape entry while
maintaining comparable uniformity. Finally, we validate the framework through
physical experiments with 6 to 7 UAVs, confirming its real-world practicality.

Conclusion: 该系统为多机器人相对定位提供了有效解决方案，且易于扩展到完整的SLAM系统。

Abstract: Radio-based methods such as Ultra-Wideband (UWB) and RAdio Detection And
Ranging (radar), which have traditionally seen limited adoption in robotics,
are experiencing a boost in popularity thanks to their robustness to harsh
environmental conditions and cluttered environments. This work proposes a
multi-robot UGV-UAV localization system that leverages the two technologies
with inexpensive and readily-available sensors, such as Inertial Measurement
Units (IMUs) and wheel encoders, to estimate the relative position of an aerial
robot with respect to a ground robot. The first stage of the system pipeline
includes a nonlinear optimization framework to trilaterate the location of the
aerial platform based on UWB range data, and a radar pre-processing module with
loosely coupled ego-motion estimation which has been adapted for a multi-robot
scenario. Then, the pre-processed radar data as well as the relative
transformation are fed to a pose-graph optimization framework with odometry and
inter-robot constraints. The system, implemented for the Robotic Operating
System (ROS 2) with the Ceres optimizer, has been validated in
Software-in-the-Loop (SITL) simulations and in a real-world dataset. The
proposed relative localization module outperforms state-of-the-art closed-form
methods which are less robust to noise. Our SITL environment includes a custom
Gazebo plugin for generating realistic UWB measurements modeled after real
data. Conveniently, the proposed factor graph formulation makes the system
readily extensible to full Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM).
Finally, all the code and experimental data is publicly available to support
reproducibility and to serve as a common open dataset for benchmarking.

maintaining generality and using less memory. We also apply Graphite to global

results indicate that our solver enables faster large-scale optimization on
both desktop and resource-constrained devices.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种多感官语言-动作（MLA）模型，通过协同感知异构感官模态并预测未来多感官目标来增强机器人对物理世界的建模能力。该模型在复杂接触丰富的真实世界任务中表现优于现有方法。


<details>

Motivation: 现有视觉-语言-动作（VLA）模型主要关注视觉和语言解释来生成动作，但机器人在空间物理世界中需要感知和交互，这凸显了对机器人特定多感官信息全面理解的需求。

Method: 提出编码器自由的多模态对齐方案，将大语言模型重新用作感知模块，通过位置对应直接解释2D图像、3D点云和触觉标记；设计未来多感官生成后训练策略，使MLA能够推理语义、几何和交互信息。

Conclusion: 多感官语言-动作模型通过增强感知表示和物理动态理解，显著提升了机器人在复杂接触丰富任务中的性能，为物理世界建模提供了更稳健的条件。

Abstract: Vision-language-action models (VLAs) have shown generalization capabilities
in robotic manipulation tasks by inheriting from vision-language models (VLMs)
and learning action generation. Most VLA models focus on interpreting vision
and language to generate actions, whereas robots must perceive and interact
within the spatial-physical world. This gap highlights the need for a
comprehensive understanding of robotic-specific multisensory information, which
is crucial for achieving complex and contact-rich control. To this end, we
introduce a multisensory language-action (MLA) model that collaboratively
perceives heterogeneous sensory modalities and predicts future multisensory
objectives to facilitate physical world modeling. Specifically, to enhance
perceptual representations, we propose an encoder-free multimodal alignment
scheme that innovatively repurposes the large language model itself as a
perception module, directly interpreting multimodal cues by aligning 2D images,
3D point clouds, and tactile tokens through positional correspondence. To
further enhance MLA's understanding of physical dynamics, we design a future
multisensory generation post-training strategy that enables MLA to reason about
semantic, geometric, and interaction information, providing more robust
conditions for action generation. For evaluation, the MLA model outperforms the
previous state-of-the-art 2D and 3D VLA methods by 12% and 24% in complex,
contact-rich real-world tasks, respectively, while also demonstrating improved
generalization to unseen configurations. Project website:
