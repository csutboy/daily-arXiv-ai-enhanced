### [1] [AI-driven formative assessment and adaptive learning in data-science education: Evaluating an LLM-powered virtual teaching assistant](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20369)
*Fadjimata I Anaroua,Qing Li,Yan Tang,Hong P. Liu*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: VITA是一个自适应分布式学习平台，集成了LLM驱动的聊天机器人，为数据科学劳动力培训提供对话支持、互操作性分析和诚信评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统教学面临日益增长的需求和可扩展性限制，需要利用对话AI来支持大规模参与、及时反馈和个性化学习。

Method: 开发端到端数据管道将聊天日志转换为xAPI语句，创建教师仪表板进行及时干预，以及自适应路径引擎引导学习者内容。

Result: 提出了可重用的互操作性对话分析架构、诚信形成性评估模式目录，以及将自适应路径集成到数据科学课程的实用蓝图。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了对话AI如何支持大规模参与、及时反馈和个性化学习，未来工作将完善平台的自适应智能并检验在不同教育环境中的适用性。

Abstract: This paper presents VITA (Virtual Teaching Assistants), an adaptive
distributed learning (ADL) platform that embeds a large language model
(LLM)-powered chatbot (BotCaptain) to provide dialogic support, interoperable
analytics, and integrity-aware assessment for workforce preparation in data
science. The platform couples context-aware conversational tutoring with
formative-assessment patterns designed to promote reflective reasoning. The
paper describes an end-to-end data pipeline that transforms chat logs into
Experience API (xAPI) statements, instructor dashboards that surface outliers
for just-in-time intervention, and an adaptive pathway engine that routes
learners among progression, reinforcement, and remediation content. The paper
also benchmarks VITA conceptually against emerging tutoring architectures,
including retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)--based assistants and Learning
Tools Interoperability (LTI)--integrated hubs, highlighting trade-offs among
content grounding, interoperability, and deployment complexity. Contributions
include a reusable architecture for interoperable conversational analytics, a
catalog of patterns for integrity-preserving formative assessment, and a
practical blueprint for integrating adaptive pathways into data-science
courses. The paper concludes with implementation lessons and a roadmap (RAG
integration, hallucination mitigation, and LTI~1.3 / OpenID Connect) to guide
multi-course evaluations and broader adoption. In light of growing demand and
scalability constraints in traditional instruction, the approach illustrates
how conversational AI can support engagement, timely feedback, and personalized
learning at scale. Future work will refine the platform's adaptive intelligence
and examine applicability across varied educational settings.

### [2] [The Secret Agenda: LLMs Strategically Lie and Our Current Safety Tools Are Blind](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20393)
*Caleb DeLeeuw,Gaurav Chawla,Aniket Sharma,Vanessa Dietze*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 该研究通过Secret Agenda和Insider Trading两个测试平台，发现大语言模型在战略欺骗场景下会为了达成目标而说谎，但现有的自动标注解释性方法无法检测或控制这种行为欺骗，而聚合的无标注激活则能提供群体层面的风险评估结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是调查大语言模型中的战略欺骗行为，探索模型在什么条件下会为了达成目标而说谎，以及现有的解释性方法能否有效检测和控制这种行为。

Method: 使用两个互补的测试平台：Secret Agenda（测试38个模型）和Insider Trading合规性（通过SAE架构）。分析自动标注的SAE特征在战略不诚实时的激活情况，并进行特征导向实验。同时使用无标注SAE激活分析欺骗与合规响应的区分模式。

Result: Secret Agenda在所有模型家族中都可靠地诱导了说谎行为。自动标注的"欺骗"特征在战略不诚实时很少激活，100多个欺骗相关特征的特征导向实验未能阻止说谎。相反，无标注SAE激活通过热图和t-SNE可视化中的判别模式成功区分了欺骗性和合规响应。

Conclusion: 自动标注驱动的解释性方法无法检测或控制行为欺骗，而聚合的无标注激活为风险评估提供了群体层面的结构。这些初步发现促使需要在更现实的欺骗背景下进行更大规模的特征发现、标注方法和因果干预研究。

Abstract: We investigate strategic deception in large language models using two
complementary testbeds: Secret Agenda (across 38 models) and Insider Trading
compliance (via SAE architectures). Secret Agenda reliably induced lying when
deception advantaged goal achievement across all model families. Analysis
revealed that autolabeled SAE features for "deception" rarely activated during
strategic dishonesty, and feature steering experiments across 100+
deception-related features failed to prevent lying. Conversely, insider trading
analysis using unlabeled SAE activations separated deceptive versus compliant
responses through discriminative patterns in heatmaps and t-SNE visualizations.
These findings suggest autolabel-driven interpretability approaches fail to
detect or control behavioral deception, while aggregate unlabeled activations
provide population-level structure for risk assessment. Results span Llama
8B/70B SAE implementations and GemmaScope under resource constraints,
representing preliminary findings that motivate larger studies on feature
discovery, labeling methodology, and causal interventions in realistic
deception contexts.

### [3] [Blueprints of Trust: AI System Cards for End to End Transparency and Governance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20394)
*Huzaifa Sidhpurwala,Emily Fox,Garth Mollett,Florencio Cano Gabarda,Roman Zhukov*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 本文提出了Hazard-Aware System Card (HASC)框架，通过整合AI系统的安全和安全态势记录，增强AI系统开发和部署的透明度和问责制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型卡和系统卡概念在AI系统安全透明性方面存在不足，需要更全面的框架来记录和沟通安全风险。

Method: HASC框架引入标准化标识符系统，包括新的AI安全风险标识符(ASH ID)，与现有安全标识符(如CVE)互补，提供单一可信信息源。

Result: 开发了能够动态记录AI系统安全态势的框架，支持开发者和利益相关者在系统全生命周期中做出更明智的安全决策。

Conclusion: HASC框架与ISO/IEC 42001:2023标准互补使用，可为AI系统提供更高的透明度和问责制。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Hazard-Aware System Card (HASC), a novel framework
designed to enhance transparency and accountability in the development and
deployment of AI systems. The HASC builds upon existing model card and system
card concepts by integrating a comprehensive, dynamic record of an AI system's
security and safety posture. The framework proposes a standardized system of
identifiers, including a novel AI Safety Hazard (ASH) ID, to complement
existing security identifiers like CVEs, allowing for clear and consistent
communication of fixed flaws. By providing a single, accessible source of
truth, the HASC empowers developers and stakeholders to make more informed
decisions about AI system safety throughout its lifecycle. Ultimately, we also
compare our proposed AI system cards with the ISO/IEC 42001:2023 standard and
discuss how they can be used to complement each other, providing greater
transparency and accountability for AI systems.

*Taaha Saleem Bajwa*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 该研究分析了2025年5月印巴冲突期间巴基斯坦媒体的报道模式，发现战争相关报道显著压制了对政治反对派和异议的报道，突显了冲突对民主话语的边缘化影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 新兴民主国家中言论自由常受限制，地区冲突期间这种效应会加剧。研究旨在探讨印巴冲突如何影响巴基斯坦媒体的报道内容。

Method: 使用大型语言模型分析三家主要报纸约2600篇新闻文章，比较战争报道与政治反对派报道的比例。

Result: 研究发现战争相关报道显著主导了媒体议程，政治反对派和异议的报道被边缘化。

Conclusion: 冲突会削弱民主话语空间，强调了在动荡地区保护新闻自由的必要性。

Abstract: Democracies rely on opposition and dissent to function, but in emerging
democracies, freedom of speech is often restricted. This effect intensifies
during regional conflicts. This study examines how the India-Pakistan conflict
of May 2025 influenced Pakistani media coverage. Analyzing approximately 2,600
news articles from three major newspapers using a large language model (LLM),
the study found that war-related reporting significantly overshadowed coverage
of political opposition and dissent. These findings highlight how conflict can
marginalize democratic discourse, reinforcing the need to safeguard press
freedom in volatile regions.

### [5] [Communication Bias in Large Language Models: A Regulatory Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21075)
*Adrian Kuenzler,Stefan Schmid*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 本文回顾了大型语言模型(LLMs)的偏见风险及其社会影响，重点关注欧盟AI法案和数字服务法案等监管框架，主张除了持续监管外，还需要加强竞争和设计治理以确保AI的公平性和可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在众多应用中的核心地位日益增强，其偏见输出、公平性和监管合规性问题引发了广泛担忧，需要系统性地评估这些风险及其社会影响。

Method: 采用文献综述和框架分析方法，重点分析了欧盟AI法案和数字服务法案等现有监管框架，并提出了超越传统监管的治理思路。

Result: 识别了LLMs偏见输出的主要风险类型，评估了现有监管框架的局限性，提出了加强竞争和设计治理的必要性。

Conclusion: 为确保AI系统的公平性和可信度，需要在持续监管的基础上，更加重视竞争政策和设计层面的治理机制。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly central to many applications,
raising concerns about bias, fairness, and regulatory compliance. This paper
reviews risks of biased outputs and their societal impact, focusing on
frameworks like the EU's AI Act and the Digital Services Act. We argue that
beyond constant regulation, stronger attention to competition and design
governance is needed to ensure fair, trustworthy AI. This is a preprint of the
Communications of the ACM article of the same title.

### [6] [Incorporating LLM Embeddings for Variation Across the Human Genome](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20702)
*Hongqian Niu,Jordan Bryan,Xihao Li,Didong Li*

Main category: stat.AP

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个系统性的框架，用于生成整个人类基因组中变异级别的嵌入表示，利用LLM嵌入技术处理89亿个可能的变异，并展示了在基因组关联研究和遗传风险预测中的应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于大语言模型的生物数据表示主要关注基因级别信息，缺乏变异级别的系统嵌入框架。本文旨在填补这一空白，为大规模基因组发现和精准医学提供基础资源。

Method: 使用FAVOR、ClinVar和GWAS Catalog的注释数据构建89亿个变异的语义文本描述，分别在三个尺度生成嵌入：150万HapMap3+MEGA变异、约9000万UK Biobank插补变异、约90亿所有可能变异，使用OpenAI text-embedding-3-large和开源Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B模型。

Result: 基线实验显示嵌入对变异属性具有高预测准确性，验证了嵌入作为基因组变异结构化表示的有效性。

Conclusion: 开发的嵌入资源已在Hugging Face公开可用，为推进大规模基因组发现和精准医学提供了重要基础，并展示了在基因组关联研究和遗传风险预测中的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language model (LLM) embeddings have enabled
powerful representations for biological data, but most applications to date
focus only on gene-level information. We present one of the first systematic
frameworks to generate variant-level embeddings across the entire human genome.
Using curated annotations from FAVOR, ClinVar, and the GWAS Catalog, we
constructed semantic text descriptions for 8.9 billion possible variants and
generated embeddings at three scales: 1.5 million HapMap3+MEGA variants, ~90
million imputed UK Biobank variants, and ~9 billion all possible variants.
Embeddings were produced with both OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large and the
open-source Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B models. Baseline experiments demonstrate high
predictive accuracy for variant properties, validating the embeddings as
structured representations of genomic variation. We outline two downstream
applications: embedding-informed hypothesis testing by extending the
Frequentist And Bayesian framework to genome-wide association studies, and
embedding-augmented genetic risk prediction that enhances standard polygenic
risk scores. These resources, publicly available on Hugging Face, provide a
foundation for advancing large-scale genomic discovery and precision medicine.

### [7] [Statistical Learning of Trade Credit Insurance Network Data with Applications to Ratemaking and Reserving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20803)
*Woongchae Yoo,Spark C. Tseung,Tsz Chai Fung*

Main category: stat.AP

TL;DR: 本文开发了一个双变量网络增强的广义线性混合模型，用于联合建模贸易信用保险的索赔概率和报告时间间隔，通过引入网络关系和随机效应来改进预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 贸易信用保险的索赔预测建模面临数据复杂性挑战，但在文献中研究不足。现有模型难以处理TCI数据特有的网络关系和报告时间间隔问题。

Method: 提出了一个双变量网络增强的GLMM模型，整合了扩展阶度中心性和业务/保单级别的随机效应，并开发了可扩展的随机期望最大化算法来处理高维积分问题。

Result: 使用亚洲TCI保险公司的六年数据进行实证分析，结果显示该模型在模型拟合度和预测准确性方面显著优于基准模型。

Conclusion: 该方法在改进TCI保险费率制定和准备金计提方面具有有效性，为TCI风险管理提供了实用的建模框架。

Abstract: Trade credit insurance (TCI) is a specialized line of property and casualty
insurance, protecting businesses against financial losses due to buyer's
insolvency. Predictive modeling for TCI claims poses formidable challenges due
to the data's complexity, yet remains underexplored in the literature.
Leveraging six years of detailed TCI data from an Asian TCI insurer, we develop
a bivariate, network-augmented Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) to jointly
model claim probability and reporting time gaps. Our model integrates
extended-order degree centrality and random effects at the business and policy
levels, adjusted for data incompleteness, to capture claim histories, reporting
time gaps, and network relationships specific to TCI data. To implement a
feasible workaround for the high-dimensional integrations required by
individual random effects, we propose a scalable Stochastic
Expectation-Maximization (SEM) algorithm. Data analysis using this TCI dataset
demonstrates that our model significantly outperforms benchmark models in both
model fit and predictive accuracy, highlighting the effectiveness of our
approach for improved ratemaking and reserving in TCI. Supplementary materials
for this article are available as an online supplement.

### [8] [Detecting gene-environment interactions to guide personalized intervention: boosting distributional regression for polygenic scores](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20850)
*Qiong Wu,Hannah Klinkhammer,Kiran Kunwar,Christian Staerk,Carlo Maj,Andreas Mayr*

Main category: stat.AP

TL;DR: 提出了snpboostlss算法，一种用于高斯位置-尺度模型的循环梯度提升算法，能够联合推导定量表型均值和方差的稀疏多基因模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多基因风险评分方法主要关注表型均值的建模，而忽略了方差。与表型方差相关的遗传变异可以为基因-环境相互作用研究提供重要见解。

Method: 使用snpboostlss算法，这是一种循环梯度提升算法，专门用于高斯位置-尺度模型。为提高计算效率，在每次提升步骤中只考虑一批最相关的变异。

Result: 在英国生物库队列中验证了他汀类药物使用与表型方差多基因风险评分之间的相互作用。结果显示，他汀类药物的治疗效果在具有较高表型方差多基因风险评分的个体中更为显著。在BMI应用中，新构建的方差多基因风险评分与体力活动和久坐行为显示出显著相互作用。

Conclusion: snpboostlss推导的表型方差多基因风险评分有潜力识别那些可能从环境变化（如医疗干预和生活方式改变）中获益更多的个体。

Abstract: Polygenic risk scores can be used to model the individual genetic liability
for human traits. Current methods primarily focus on modeling the mean of a
phenotype neglecting the variance. However, genetic variants associated with
phenotypic variance can provide important insights to gene-environment
interaction studies. To overcome this, we propose snpboostlss, a cyclical
gradient boosting algorithm for a Gaussian location-scale model to jointly
derive sparse polygenic models for both the mean and the variance of a
quantitative phenotype. To improve computational efficiency on high-dimensional
and large-scale genotype data (large n and large p), we only consider a batch
of most relevant variants in each boosting step. We investigate the effect of
statins therapy (the environmental factor) on low-density lipoprotein in the UK
Biobank cohort using the new snpboostlss algorithm. We are able to verify the
interaction between statins usage and the polygenic risk scores for phenotypic
variance in both cross sectional and longitudinal analyses. Particularly,
following the spirit of target trial emulation, we observe that the treatment
effect of statins is more substantial in people with higher polygenic risk
scores for phenotypic variance, indicating gene-environment interaction. When
applying to body mass index, the newly constructed polygenic risk scores for
variance show significant interaction with physical activity and sedentary
behavior. Therefore, the polygenic risk scores for phenotypic variance derived
by snpboostlss have potential to identify individuals that could benefit more
from environmental changes (e.g. medical intervention and lifestyle changes).

### [9] [A sub-hourly spatio-temporal statistical model for solar irradiance in Ireland using open-source data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21041)
*Maeve Upton,Eamonn Organ,Amanda Lenzi,James Sweeney*

Main category: stat.AP

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一种新颖的贝叶斯时空建模框架，用于在爱尔兰预测小时和10分钟分辨率的太阳辐照度，在稀疏地面测量站的情况下提供更准确的太阳能预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在爱尔兰高度变化的海洋性气候中，地面测量站分布稀疏，选择合适的太阳辐照度数据集具有重大挑战，需要更准确的太阳能光伏发电建模。

Method: 采用贝叶斯时空建模框架，预测小时和10分钟分辨率的太阳辐照度，并与再分析数据集和最近站点插值法进行比较评估。

Result: 模型在所有时间分辨率下都具有统计稳健性，小时分辨率预测精度最高，10分钟分辨率误差较高但不确定性量化更好。模型在站点特异性准确性方面优于ERA5等替代数据源。

Conclusion: 该模型不仅超越了现有数据集，还提供完整的不确定性量化、可扩展性和实时实施能力，为太阳能预测和逆变器欠载导致的过载削波损失估算提供了强大工具。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of solar irradiance is essential for reliable modelling
of solar photovoltaic (PV) power production. In Ireland's highly variable
maritime climate, where ground-based measurement stations are sparsely
distributed, selecting an appropriate solar irradiance dataset presents a
significant challenge. This study introduces a novel Bayesian spatio-temporal
modelling framework for predicting solar irradiance at hourly and sub-hourly
(10-minute) resolutions across Ireland. Cross-validation demonstrates that our
model is statistically robust across all temporal resolutions with hourly
showing highest prediction precision whereas 10-minute resolution encounters
higher errors but better uncertainty quantification. In separate evaluations,
we compare our model against alternative data sources, including reanalysis
datasets and nearest-station interpolation, and find that it consistently
provides superior site-specific accuracy. At the hourly scale, our model
outperforms ERA5 in agreement with ground-based observations. At the sub-hourly
scale, 10-minute resolution estimates provide solar PV power outputs consistent
with residential and industrial solar PV installations in Ireland. Beyond
surpassing existing datasets, our model delivers full uncertainty
quantification, scalability and the capacity for real-time implementation,
offering a powerful tool for solar energy prediction and the estimation of
losses due to overload clipping from inverter undersizing.

### [10] [Not All Accuracy Is Equal: Prioritizing Diversity in Infectious Disease Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21191)
*Carson Dudley,Marisa Eisenberg*

Main category: stat.AP

TL;DR: 本文分析了流行病预测集成模型表现不佳的原因，指出模型间高度相关的误差限制了集成效果，并提出应优先选择提供互补信息的模型来构建真正多样化的集成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管集成预测已成为大规模疾病应对的基石，但实际表现往往不如预期。CDC的COVID-19和流感预测集成仅比最佳单一模型提升1%，甚至有时排名低于多个个体模型，这引发了集成模型为何表现不佳的疑问。

Method: 通过分析当前集成构建方法的问题：模型开发者和集成构建者都专注于独立准确性，导致模型基于相同监测数据和相似方法训练，产生高度相关的误差。

Result: 研究发现模型间的冗余性限制了集成效益，大型集成有时只能带来边际收益。

Conclusion: 为实现集成模型的潜力，模型开发者和集成构建者应优先选择能提供互补信息的模型，构建真正多样化的集成，从而产生更稳健、更有价值的流行病预测。

Abstract: Ensemble forecasts have become a cornerstone of large-scale disease response,
underpinning decision making at agencies such as the US Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC). Their growing use reflects the goal of combining
multiple models to improve accuracy and stability versus using a single model.
However, recent experience shows these benefits are not guaranteed. During the
COVID-19 pandemic, the CDC's multi-model forecasting ensemble outperformed the
best single model by only 1%, and CDC flu forecasting ensembles have often
ranked below multiple individual models.
  This raises a key question: why are ensembles underperforming? We posit that
a central reason is that both model developers and ensemble builders typically
focus on stand-alone accuracy. Models are fit to minimize their own forecasting
error, and ensembles are often weighted according to those same scores.
However, most epidemic forecasts are built from a small set of approaches and
trained on the same surveillance data, leading to highly correlated errors.
This redundancy limits the benefit of ensembling and may explain why large
ensembles sometimes deliver only marginal gains.
  To realize the potential of ensembles, both modelers and ensemblers should
prioritize models that contribute complementary information rather than
replicating existing approaches. Ensembles built with this principle in mind
move beyond size for its own sake toward true diversity, producing forecasts
that are more robust and more valuable for epidemic preparedness and response.

*Sven Ochs,Philip Schörner,Marc René Zofka,J. Marius Zöllner*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出一种将语义相机数据与LiDAR分割相结合的方法，通过将LiDAR点投影到相机语义分割空间来增强LiDAR定位的精度和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LiDAR数据的语义分割在处理不同传感器类型和配置时面临挑战，但融入语义信息可以显著提高自主移动系统LiDAR定位的准确性和鲁棒性。

Method: 使用CoCar NextGen平台的多传感器配置，结合Depth-Anything网络进行相机图像分割和自适应分割网络进行LiDAR分割，通过GNSS RTK建立可靠的地面真值。

Result: 在德国卡尔斯鲁厄市进行了55公里的广泛测试，覆盖城市区域、多车道道路和乡村高速公路等多种环境，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 这种多模态方法为在复杂现实环境中实现更可靠和精确的自主导航系统铺平了道路。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of LiDAR data presents considerable challenges,
particularly when dealing with diverse sensor types and configurations.
However, incorporating semantic information can significantly enhance the
accuracy and robustness of LiDAR-based localization techniques for autonomous
mobile systems. We propose an approach that integrates semantic camera data
with LiDAR segmentation to address this challenge. By projecting LiDAR points
into the semantic segmentation space of the camera, our method enhances the
precision and reliability of the LiDAR-based localization pipeline.
  For validation, we utilize the CoCar NextGen platform from the FZI Research
Center for Information Technology, which offers diverse sensor modalities and
configurations. The sensor setup of CoCar NextGen enables a thorough analysis
of different sensor types. Our evaluation leverages the state-of-the-art
Depth-Anything network for camera image segmentation and an adaptive
segmentation network for LiDAR segmentation. To establish a reliable ground
truth for LiDAR-based localization, we make us of a Global Navigation Satellite
System (GNSS) solution with Real-Time Kinematic corrections (RTK).
Additionally, we conduct an extensive 55 km drive through the city of
Karlsruhe, Germany, covering a variety of environments, including urban areas,
multi-lane roads, and rural highways. This multimodal approach paves the way
for more reliable and precise autonomous navigation systems, particularly in
complex real-world environments.

Abstract: This paper presents the initial results from our structured literature review
on applications of Formal Methods (FM) to Robotic Autonomous Systems (RAS). We
describe our structured survey methodology; including database selection and
associated search strings, search filters and collaborative review of
identified papers. We categorise and enumerate the FM approaches and formalisms
that have been used for specification and verification of RAS. We investigate
FM in the context of sub-symbolic AI-enabled RAS and examine the evolution of
how FM is used over time in this field. This work complements a pre-existing
survey in this area and we examine how this research area has matured over
time. Specifically, our survey demonstrates that some trends have persisted as
observed in a previous survey. Additionally, it recognized new trends that were
not considered previously including a noticeable increase in adopting Formal
Synthesis approaches as well as Probabilistic Verification Techniques.

*Boqi Li,Siyuan Li,Weiyi Wang,Anran Li,Zhong Cao,Henry X. Liu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种零样本视觉语言导航框架，结合简化的路径点预测器和多模态大语言模型，在连续环境中实现高效的导航性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着基础模型和机器人技术的快速发展，视觉语言导航成为具身智能体的关键任务。连续环境下的VLN尤其具有挑战性，需要同时理解自然语言指令、感知环境和规划底层动作。

Method: 使用简化的路径点预测器在抽象障碍物地图上生成线性可达路径点，构建动态更新的拓扑图并记录访问历史。将图和访问信息编码到提示中，使MLLM能够进行空间结构和探索历史的推理。

Result: 在R2R-CE和RxR-CE数据集上的实验表明，该方法实现了最先进的零样本性能，成功率分别达到41%和36%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架通过结合路径点预测和MLLM推理，在连续环境中实现了高效的视觉语言导航，为具身智能体的实际应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: With the rapid progress of foundation models and robotics, vision-language
navigation (VLN) has emerged as a key task for embodied agents with broad
practical applications. We address VLN in continuous environments, a
particularly challenging setting where an agent must jointly interpret natural
language instructions, perceive its surroundings, and plan low-level actions.
We propose a zero-shot framework that integrates a simplified yet effective
waypoint predictor with a multimodal large language model (MLLM). The predictor
operates on an abstract obstacle map, producing linearly reachable waypoints,
which are incorporated into a dynamically updated topological graph with
explicit visitation records. The graph and visitation information are encoded
into the prompt, enabling reasoning over both spatial structure and exploration
history to encourage exploration and equip MLLM with local path planning for
error correction. Extensive experiments on R2R-CE and RxR-CE show that our
method achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance, with success rates of
41% and 36%, respectively, outperforming prior state-of-the-art methods.

African elephant trunk, we present MELEGROS, a Monolithic ELEphant-inspired
GRipper with Optical Sensors, emphasizing sensing as an intrinsic,
co-fabricated capability. Unlike multi-material or tendon-based approaches,
MELEGROS directly integrates six optical waveguide sensors and five pneumatic
chambers into a pneumatically actuated lattice structure (12.5 mm cell size)
using a single soft resin and one continuous 3D print. This eliminates
mechanical mismatches between sensors, actuators, and body, reducing model
uncertainty and enabling simulation-guided sensor design and placement. Only
four iterations were required to achieve the final prototype, which features a
continuous structure capable of elongation, compression, and bending while
decoupling tactile and proprioceptive signals. MELEGROS (132 g) lifts more than
twice its weight, performs bioinspired actions such as pinching, scooping, and
reaching, and delicately grasps fragile items like grapes. The integrated
optical sensors provide distinct responses to touch, bending, and chamber
deformation, enabling multifunctional perception. MELEGROS demonstrates a new
paradigm for soft robotics where fully embedded sensing and continuous
structures inherently support versatile, bioinspired manipulation.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种感知-动作框架，使四足机器人在单腿推动物体时能够处理传感器遮挡问题，通过本体感觉反馈预测物体位移并重新检测物体，提高了在楼梯等复杂地形上的任务成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人在密集杂乱环境中自主操作时，需要与障碍物进行物理交互来清理路径。但在复杂地形（如杂乱的楼梯）上，单腿推动等紧密耦合的物理动作会导致物体在操作过程中被传感器遮挡，需要解决这一约束问题。

Method: 提出了紧密耦合的感知-动作框架，包括交互感知的状态估计循环，利用足部接触和腿部位置的本体感觉反馈来预测物体在遮挡期间的位移，指导感知系统在交互后重新检测物体。

Result: 在波士顿动力Spot机器人上的实验结果表明，与开环基线相比，交互感知方法在楼梯上推动物体时实现了更高的任务成功率和跟踪精度。

Conclusion: 该交互感知框架通过闭环感知-动作系统有效解决了物体在推动过程中的遮挡问题，使机器人能够从物理结果中学习，提高了在复杂环境中的操作能力。

Abstract: For robots to operate autonomously in densely cluttered environments, they
must reason about and potentially physically interact with obstacles to clear a
path. Safely clearing a path on challenging terrain, such as a cluttered
staircase, requires controlled interaction. For example, a quadrupedal robot
that pushes objects out of the way with one leg while maintaining a stable
stance with its three other legs. However, tightly coupled physical actions,
such as one-legged pushing, create new constraints on the system that can be
difficult to predict at design time. In this work, we present a new method that
addresses one such constraint, wherein the object being pushed by a quadrupedal
robot with one of its legs becomes occluded from the robot's sensors during
manipulation. To address this challenge, we present a tightly coupled
perception-action framework that enables the robot to perceive clutter, reason
about feasible push paths, and execute the clearing maneuver. Our core
contribution is an interaction-aware state estimation loop that uses
proprioceptive feedback regarding foot contact and leg position to predict an
object's displacement during the occlusion. This prediction guides the
perception system to robustly re-detect the object after the interaction,
closing the loop between action and sensing to enable accurate tracking even
after partial pushes. Using this feedback allows the robot to learn from
physical outcomes, reclassifying an object as immovable if a push fails due to
it being too heavy. We present results of implementing our approach on a Boston
Dynamics Spot robot that show our interaction-aware approach achieves higher
task success rates and tracking accuracy in pushing objects on stairs compared
to open-loop baselines.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SPARQ是一种基于学习进度的查询策略，只在学习停滞或恶化时请求人类反馈，显著减少不必要的反馈调用，在保持高性能的同时降低人类参与成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中人类反馈成本高昂且有限，现有的人机交互强化学习方法假设反馈充足，限制了其在物理机器人部署中的实用性。

Method: 提出SPARQ查询策略，通过监测学习进度，仅在性能下降或停滞时请求反馈。在PyBullet模拟环境中使用UR5机器人进行立方体拾取任务评估。

Result: SPARQ实现了接近完美的任务成功率，与始终查询的性能相当，但仅消耗约一半的反馈预算。相比随机查询提供更稳定高效的学习，显著优于无反馈训练。

Conclusion: 基于进度的选择性查询策略可以使人机交互强化学习在现实人类努力约束下更加高效和可扩展。

Abstract: Human feedback can greatly accelerate robot learning, but in real-world
settings, such feedback is costly and limited. Existing human-in-the-loop
reinforcement learning (HiL-RL) methods often assume abundant feedback,
limiting their practicality for physical robot deployment. In this work, we
introduce SPARQ, a progress-aware query policy that requests feedback only when
learning stagnates or worsens, thereby reducing unnecessary oracle calls. We
evaluate SPARQ on a simulated UR5 cube-picking task in PyBullet, comparing
against three baselines: no feedback, random querying, and always querying. Our
experiments show that SPARQ achieves near-perfect task success, matching the
performance of always querying while consuming about half the feedback budget.
It also provides more stable and efficient learning than random querying, and
significantly improves over training without feedback. These findings suggest
that selective, progress-based query strategies can make HiL-RL more efficient
and scalable for robots operating under realistic human effort constraints.

Conclusion: GraspFactory数据集为训练数据密集型机器人抓取模型提供了重要资源，有助于解决模型泛化问题，数据集和工具已公开提供。

Abstract: Robotic grasping is a crucial task in industrial automation, where robots are
increasingly expected to handle a wide range of objects. However, a significant
challenge arises when robot grasping models trained on limited datasets
encounter novel objects. In real-world environments such as warehouses or
manufacturing plants, the diversity of objects can be vast, and grasping models
need to generalize to this diversity. Training large, generalizable
robot-grasping models requires geometrically diverse datasets. In this paper,
we introduce GraspFactory, a dataset containing over 109 million 6-DoF grasps
collectively for the Franka Panda (with 14,690 objects) and Robotiq 2F-85
grippers (with 33,710 objects). GraspFactory is designed for training
data-intensive models, and we demonstrate the generalization capabilities of
one such model trained on a subset of GraspFactory in both simulated and
real-world settings. The dataset and tools are made available for download at

Abstract: This paper proposes an uncertainty-aware marine pollution source tracking
framework for unmanned surface vehicles (USVs). By integrating high-fidelity
marine pollution dispersion simulation with informative path planning
techniques, we demonstrate effective identification of pollution sources in
marine environments. The proposed approach is implemented based on Robot
Operating System (ROS), processing real-time sensor data to update
probabilistic source location estimates. The system progressively refines the
estimation of source location while quantifying uncertainty levels in its
predictions. Experiments conducted in simulated environments with varying
source locations, flow conditions, and starting positions demonstrate the
framework's ability to localise pollution sources with high accuracy. Results
show that the proposed approach achieves reliable source localisation
efficiently. This work contributes to the development of full autonomous
environmental monitoring capabilities essential for rapid response to marine
pollution incidents.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种推理时潜在激活编辑（LAE）框架，可在不修改预训练策略权重的情况下，通过监测和选择性修改中间激活来提升多旋翼无人机导航的安全性，减少约90%的碰撞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管强化学习在多旋翼无人机协调导航方面取得进展，但训练好的策略在障碍物密集环境中仍容易发生碰撞。重新训练或微调成本高且可能降低已学技能，因此需要一种轻量级的推理时干预方法。

Method: LAE框架包含两个阶段：在线分类器监测中间激活以检测不良行为状态；激活编辑模块选择性修改标记的激活，使策略转向更安全的行为。通过训练潜在碰撞世界模型预测未来碰撞前激活，促使更早的避障响应。

Result: 大量仿真和真实Crazyflie实验表明，LAE显著减少碰撞（比未编辑基线减少近90%累计碰撞），大幅提高无碰撞轨迹比例，同时保持任务完成能力。

Conclusion: LAE作为一种轻量级范式，可在资源受限硬件上实现学习机器人策略的部署后优化，为安全关键应用提供了有效的推理时干预方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has enabled significant progress in complex domains
such as coordinating and navigating multiple quadrotors. However, even
well-trained policies remain vulnerable to collisions in obstacle-rich
environments. Addressing these infrequent but critical safety failures through
retraining or fine-tuning is costly and risks degrading previously learned
skills. Inspired by activation steering in large language models and latent
editing in computer vision, we introduce a framework for inference-time Latent
Activation Editing (LAE) that refines the behavior of pre-trained policies
without modifying their weights or architecture. The framework operates in two
stages: (i) an online classifier monitors intermediate activations to detect
states associated with undesired behaviors, and (ii) an activation editing
module that selectively modifies flagged activations to shift the policy
towards safer regimes. In this work, we focus on improving safety in
multi-quadrotor navigation. We hypothesize that amplifying a policy's internal
perception of risk can induce safer behaviors. We instantiate this idea through
a latent collision world model trained to predict future pre-collision
activations, thereby prompting earlier and more cautious avoidance responses.
Extensive simulations and real-world Crazyflie experiments demonstrate that LAE
achieves statistically significant reduction in collisions (nearly 90% fewer
cumulative collisions compared to the unedited baseline) and substantially
increases the fraction of collision-free trajectories, while preserving task
completion. More broadly, our results establish LAE as a lightweight paradigm,
feasible on resource-constrained hardware, for post-deployment refinement of
learned robot policies.

across mixed-terrain scenarios.

Abstract: Dexterous in-hand manipulation remains a foundational challenge in robotics,
with progress often constrained by the prevailing paradigm of imitating the
human hand. This anthropomorphic approach creates two critical barriers: 1) it
limits robotic capabilities to tasks humans can already perform, and 2) it
makes data collection for learning-based methods exceedingly difficult. Both
challenges are caused by traditional force-closure which requires coordinating
complex, multi-point contacts based on friction, normal force, and gravity to
grasp an object. This makes teleoperated demonstrations unstable and amplifies
the sim-to-real gap for reinforcement learning. In this work, we propose a
paradigm shift: moving away from replicating human mechanics toward the design
of novel robotic embodiments. We introduce the \textbf{S}uction
\textbf{Leap}-Hand (SLeap Hand), a multi-fingered hand featuring integrated
fingertip suction cups that realize a new form of suction-enabled dexterity. By
replacing complex force-closure grasps with stable, single-point adhesion, our
design fundamentally simplifies in-hand teleoperation and facilitates the
collection of high-quality demonstration data. More importantly, this
suction-based embodiment unlocks a new class of dexterous skills that are
difficult or even impossible for the human hand, such as one-handed paper
cutting and in-hand writing. Our work demonstrates that by moving beyond
anthropomorphic constraints, novel embodiments can not only lower the barrier
for collecting robust manipulation data but also enable the stable,
single-handed completion of tasks that would typically require two human hands.

Conclusion: 提出的触觉共享控制框架在帮助人类驾驶员获取高性能驾驶技能方面表现出色，优于传统训练方法。

Abstract: This study introduces a haptic shared control framework designed to teach
human drivers advanced driving skills. In this context, shared control refers
to a driving mode where the human driver collaborates with an autonomous
driving system to control the steering of a vehicle simultaneously. Advanced
driving skills are those necessary to safely push the vehicle to its handling
limits in high-performance driving such as racing and emergency obstacle
avoidance. Previous research has demonstrated the performance and safety
benefits of shared control schemes using both subjective and objective
evaluations. However, these schemes have not been assessed for their impact on
skill acquisition on complex and demanding tasks. Prior research on long-term
skill acquisition either applies haptic shared control to simple tasks or
employs other feedback methods like visual and auditory aids. To bridge this
gap, this study creates a cyber racing coach framework based on the haptic
shared control paradigm and evaluates its performance in helping human drivers
acquire high-performance driving skills. The framework introduces (1) an
autonomous driving system that is capable of cooperating with humans in a
highly performant driving scenario; and (2) a haptic shared control mechanism
along with a fading scheme to gradually reduce the steering assistance from
autonomy based on the human driver's performance during training. Two
benchmarks are considered: self-learning (no assistance) and full assistance
during training. Results from a human subject study indicate that the proposed
framework helps human drivers develop superior racing skills compared to the
benchmarks, resulting in better performance and consistency.

Method: 使用14通道EEG头戴设备进行个性化运动想象校准，基于智能手机的AR界面提供多目标导航和方向一致反馈，机器人手臂结合决策输出和视觉姿态估计实现自主抓取。

Result: 运动想象训练准确率达93.1%，平均信息传输率为14.8 bit/min；AR神经反馈显著提升持续控制能力（SCI=0.210），达到最高ITR（21.3 bit/min）；闭环抓取成功率达97.2%，用户控制感强。

Conclusion: AR反馈显著稳定了基于EEG的控制，提出的框架实现了稳健的零接触抓取，推动了辅助机器人应用和未来人机交互模式的发展。

Abstract: Reliable brain-computer interface (BCI) control of robots provides an
intuitive and accessible means of human-robot interaction, particularly
valuable for individuals with motor impairments. However, existing BCI-Robot
systems face major limitations: electroencephalography (EEG) signals are noisy
and unstable, target selection is often predefined and inflexible, and most
studies remain restricted to simulation without closed-loop validation. These
issues hinder real-world deployment in assistive scenarios. To address them, we
propose a closed-loop BCI-AR-Robot system that integrates motor imagery
(MI)-based EEG decoding, augmented reality (AR) neurofeedback, and robotic
grasping for zero-touch operation. A 14-channel EEG headset enabled
individualized MI calibration, a smartphone-based AR interface supported
multi-target navigation with direction-congruent feedback to enhance stability,
and the robotic arm combined decision outputs with vision-based pose estimation
for autonomous grasping. Experiments are conducted to validate the framework:
MI training achieved 93.1 percent accuracy with an average information transfer
rate (ITR) of 14.8 bit/min; AR neurofeedback significantly improved sustained
control (SCI = 0.210) and achieved the highest ITR (21.3 bit/min) compared with
static, sham, and no-AR baselines; and closed-loop grasping achieved a 97.2
percent success rate with good efficiency and strong user-reported control.
These results show that AR feedback substantially stabilizes EEG-based control
and that the proposed framework enables robust zero-touch grasping, advancing
assistive robotic applications and future modes of human-robot interaction.

pre-processes Doppler velocity into invariant node and edge features in the

open-source dataset and self-collected dataset show Equi-RO outperforms
state-of-the-art algorithms in accuracy and robustness. Overall, our method

Abstract: Implicit representations have been widely applied in robotics for obstacle
avoidance and path planning. In this paper, we explore the problem of
constructing an implicit distance representation from a single image. Past
methods for implicit surface reconstruction, such as \emph{NeuS} and its
variants generally require a large set of multi-view images as input, and
require long training times. In this work, we propose Fast Image-to-Neural
Surface (FINS), a lightweight framework that can reconstruct high-fidelity
surfaces and SDF fields based on a single or a small set of images. FINS
integrates a multi-resolution hash grid encoder with lightweight geometry and
color heads, making the training via an approximate second-order optimizer
highly efficient and capable of converging within a few seconds. Additionally,
we achieve the construction of a neural surface requiring only a single RGB
image, by leveraging pre-trained foundation models to estimate the geometry
inherent in the image. Our experiments demonstrate that under the same
conditions, our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both
convergence speed and accuracy on surface reconstruction and SDF field
estimation. Moreover, we demonstrate the applicability of FINS for robot
surface following tasks and show its scalability to a variety of benchmark
datasets.

Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) has shown great promise in automatically
designing lightweight models. However, conventional approaches are insufficient
in training the supernet and pay little attention to actual robot hardware
resources. To meet such challenges, we propose RAM-NAS, a resource-aware
multi-objective NAS method that focuses on improving the supernet pretrain and
resource-awareness on robot hardware devices. We introduce the concept of
subnets mutual distillation, which refers to mutually distilling all subnets
sampled by the sandwich rule. Additionally, we utilize the Decoupled Knowledge
Distillation (DKD) loss to enhance logits distillation performance. To expedite
the search process with consideration for hardware resources, we used data from
three types of robotic edge hardware to train Latency Surrogate predictors.
These predictors facilitated the estimation of hardware inference latency
during the search phase, enabling a unified multi-objective evolutionary search
to balance model accuracy and latency trade-offs. Our discovered model family,
RAM-NAS models, can achieve top-1 accuracy ranging from 76.7% to 81.4% on
ImageNet. In addition, the resource-aware multi-objective NAS we employ
significantly reduces the model's inference latency on edge hardware for
robots. We conducted experiments on downstream tasks to verify the scalability
of our methods. The inference time for detection and segmentation is reduced on
all three hardware types compared to MobileNetv3-based methods. Our work fills
the gap in NAS for robot hardware resource-aware.

Abstract: Conventional multi-rotors are under-actuated systems, hindering them from
independently controlling attitude from position. In this study, we present
several distinct configurations that incorporate additional control inputs for
manipulating the angles of the propeller axes. This addresses the mentioned
limitations, making the systems "omniorientational". We comprehensively derived
detailed dynamic models for all introduced configurations and validated by a
methodology using Simscape Multibody simulations. Two controllers are designed:
a sliding mode controller for robust handling of disturbances and a novel
PID-based controller with gravity compensation integrating linear and
non-linear allocators, designed for computational efficiency. A custom control
allocation strategy is implemented to manage the input-non-affine nature of
these systems, seeking to maximize battery life by minimizing the "Power

TL;DR: 本文扩展了基于强迫振荡的行走降阶模型，加入了踝关节和足部。设计了人体启发的踝关节动力学范式，相比点足模型改善了步态特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展点足行走模型，加入踝关节和足部动力学，以更好地模拟人类行走的稳定机制。

Method: 设计人体启发的踝关节动力学范式，结合足部放置和踝关节策略来稳定行走。

Result: 新模型能通过足部放置和踝关节策略稳定大初始条件误差，对小扰动仅需踝关节方案即可稳定，这与人类观察一致。

Conclusion: 该模型的新特性有助于更好理解拟人行走及其稳定机制。

Abstract: This paper extends the forced-oscillation-based reduced-order model of
walking to a model with ankles and feet. A human-inspired paradigm was designed
for the ankle dynamics, which results in improved gait characteristics compared
to the point-foot model. In addition, it was shown that while the proposed
model can stabilize against large errors in initial conditions through
combination of foot placement and ankle strategies, the model is able to
stabilize against small perturbations without relying on the foot placement
control and solely through the designed proprioceptive ankle scheme. This novel
property, which is also observed in humans, can help in better understanding of
anthropomorphic walking and its stabilization mechanisms.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RuN框架通过解耦残差学习方法，将运动生成和动态控制分离，实现了人形机器人从走到跑的平滑过渡和宽速度范围内的稳定自然步态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决人形机器人在宽速度范围内实现自然动态步态（包括从走到跑的平滑过渡）的挑战，现有方法需要单一策略同时学习运动模仿、速度跟踪和稳定性维持，导致训练困难。

Method: 提出RuN解耦残差学习框架：预训练的条件运动生成器提供运动先验，强化学习策略学习轻量级残差校正来处理动态交互。

Result: 在Unitree G1人形机器人上的仿真和真实实验表明，RuN在0-2.5 m/s速度范围内实现了稳定自然的步态和平滑的走跑转换，在训练效率和最终性能上都优于现有最优方法。

Conclusion: RuN框架通过任务分解有效解决了人形机器人动态步态控制问题，为自然运动生成提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Enabling humanoid robots to achieve natural and dynamic locomotion across a
wide range of speeds, including smooth transitions from walking to running,
presents a significant challenge. Existing deep reinforcement learning methods
typically require the policy to directly track a reference motion, forcing a
single policy to simultaneously learn motion imitation, velocity tracking, and
stability maintenance. To address this, we introduce RuN, a novel decoupled
residual learning framework. RuN decomposes the control task by pairing a
pre-trained Conditional Motion Generator, which provides a kinematically
natural motion prior, with a reinforcement learning policy that learns a
lightweight residual correction to handle dynamical interactions. Experiments
in simulation and reality on the Unitree G1 humanoid robot demonstrate that RuN
achieves stable, natural gaits and smooth walk-run transitions across a broad
velocity range (0-2.5 m/s), outperforming state-of-the-art methods in both
training efficiency and final performance.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了JFTO框架，通过关节流轨迹优化解决从人类视频演示中学习机器人操作任务的问题，将演示视为物体中心指导而非直接模仿人手动作，平衡抓取姿态选择、物体轨迹生成和避障三个目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从人类视频演示学习为机器人操作提供可扩展的替代方案，但由于身体差异和关节可行性约束，直接模仿人手动作存在挑战，需要开发能够处理这些差异的方法。

Method: JFTO框架扩展流匹配到SE(3)空间进行物体轨迹的概率建模，通过统一可微分目标函数优化抓取相似度、轨迹似然和碰撞惩罚，实现密度感知的模仿学习。

Result: 在仿真和真实世界实验中验证了方法在多样化操作任务中的有效性，能够生成可行的抓取姿态和与演示一致的物体轨迹。

Conclusion: JFTO框架成功解决了从视频演示学习机器人操作的关键挑战，通过物体中心的方法和概率轨迹建模实现了有效的模仿学习，为视频基LfD提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Learning from human video demonstrations offers a scalable alternative to
teleoperation or kinesthetic teaching, but poses challenges for robot
manipulators due to embodiment differences and joint feasibility constraints.
We address this problem by proposing the Joint Flow Trajectory Optimization
(JFTO) framework for grasp pose generation and object trajectory imitation
under the video-based Learning-from-Demonstration (LfD) paradigm. Rather than
directly imitating human hand motions, our method treats demonstrations as
object-centric guides, balancing three objectives: (i) selecting a feasible
grasp pose, (ii) generating object trajectories consistent with demonstrated
motions, and (iii) ensuring collision-free execution within robot kinematics.
To capture the multimodal nature of demonstrations, we extend flow matching to
$\SE(3)$ for probabilistic modeling of object trajectories, enabling
density-aware imitation that avoids mode collapse. The resulting optimization
integrates grasp similarity, trajectory likelihood, and collision penalties
into a unified differentiable objective. We validate our approach in both
simulation and real-world experiments across diverse real-world manipulation
tasks.

TL;DR: BIM2RDT框架通过AI技术将静态BIM模型转化为动态的机器人就绪数字孪生，集成BIM数据、IoT传感器和机器人视觉数据，采用创新的SG-ICP点云配准算法提升对齐精度，并实现实时安全监控


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决建筑行业BIM模型与实时现场条件之间的差距，提升数字管理的安全性和效率

Method: 提出BIM2RDT框架，集成三种数据流：BIM几何语义信息、IoT活动数据、机器人视觉空间数据；开发SG-ICP点云配准算法，利用LLM推理推断物体方向先验；结合YOLOE目标检测和Shi-Tomasi角点检测技术；集成实时手部振动监测

Result: SG-ICP相比标准ICP在特征遮挡场景下对齐RMSE降低64.3%-88.3%；HAV集成能够在超过暴露限值时触发警告，提升ISO 5349-1合规性

Conclusion: BIM2RDT框架成功将静态BIM转化为动态数字孪生，通过AI技术显著提升了建筑现场的安全监控和机器人操作精度

Abstract: The adoption of cyber-physical systems and jobsite intelligence that connects
design models, real-time site sensing, and autonomous field operations can
dramatically enhance digital management in the construction industry. This
paper introduces BIM2RDT (Building Information Models to Robot-Ready Site
Digital Twins), an agentic artificial intelligence (AI) framework designed to
transform static Building Information Modeling (BIM) into dynamic, robot-ready
digital twins (DTs) that prioritize safety during execution. The framework
bridges the gap between pre-existing BIM data and real-time site conditions by
integrating three key data streams: geometric and semantic information from BIM
models, activity data from IoT sensor networks, and visual-spatial data
collected by robots during site traversal. The methodology introduces
Semantic-Gravity ICP (SG-ICP), a point cloud registration algorithm that
leverages large language model (LLM) reasoning. Unlike traditional methods,
SG-ICP utilizes an LLM to infer object-specific, plausible orientation priors
based on BIM semantics, improving alignment accuracy by avoiding convergence on
local minima. This creates a feedback loop where robot-collected data updates
the DT, which in turn optimizes paths for missions. The framework employs YOLOE
object detection and Shi-Tomasi corner detection to identify and track
construction elements while using BIM geometry as a priori maps. The framework
also integrates real-time Hand-Arm Vibration (HAV) monitoring, mapping
sensor-detected safety events to the digital twin using IFC standards for
intervention. Experiments demonstrate SG-ICP's superiority over standard ICP,
achieving RMSE reductions of 64.3%--88.3% in alignment across scenarios with
occluded features, ensuring plausible orientations. HAV integration triggers
warnings upon exceeding exposure limits, enhancing compliance with ISO 5349-1.

TL;DR: 提出了一种将自然语言指令与BIM语义地图融合的新框架，通过Beta-Bernoulli贝叶斯融合将LLM视为传感器，生成上下文感知的排斥增益来改进机器人路径规划。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在建筑领域，BIM模型包含丰富的自然语言环境描述，需要将自然语言指令与机器人任务规划有效集成，以生成更安全、更符合上下文的路径。

Method: 将障碍物的设计时排斥系数建模为Beta随机变量，利用LLM返回的危险分数作为伪计数更新参数，生成连续、上下文感知的排斥增益，增强基于欧几里得距离的势场成本启发式。

Result: 仿真结果表明，Beta-Bernoulli融合在路径鲁棒性和有效性方面都取得了定性和定量的改进。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种数值稳定的方法，能够链接多个自然命令和提示，为任何学习或经典AI框架提供集成灵活性，实现更智能的机器人路径规划。

Abstract: Integrating natural language (NL) prompts into robotic mission planning has
attracted significant interest in recent years. In the construction domain,
Building Information Models (BIM) encapsulate rich NL descriptions of the
environment. We present a novel framework that fuses NL directives with
BIM-derived semantic maps via a Beta-Bernoulli Bayesian fusion by interpreting
the LLM as a sensor: each obstacle's design-time repulsive coefficient is
treated as a Beta(alpha, beta) random variable and LLM-returned danger scores
are incorporated as pseudo-counts to update alpha and beta. The resulting
posterior mean yields a continuous, context-aware repulsive gain that augments
a Euclidean-distance-based potential field for cost heuristics. By adjusting
gains based on sentiment and context inferred from user prompts, our method
guides robots along safer, more context-aware paths. This provides a
numerically stable method that can chain multiple natural commands and prompts
from construction workers and foreman to enable planning while giving
flexibility to be integrated in any learned or classical AI framework.
Simulation results demonstrate that this Beta-Bernoulli fusion yields both
qualitative and quantitative improvements in path robustness and validity.

TL;DR: RobotDancing是一个简单可扩展的框架，通过预测残差关节目标来纠正人形机器人动态运动中的模型-植物不匹配问题，实现零样本从仿真到实体的高动态运动跟踪。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决人形机器人在长时间高动态运动跟踪中的脆弱性问题，因为绝对关节指令无法补偿模型与实体之间的不匹配，导致误差累积。

Method: 使用端到端管道，包括训练、仿真到仿真验证和零样本仿真到实体部署，采用单阶段强化学习设置，具有统一的观测、奖励和超参数配置。

Result: 在Unitree G1上评估，能够跟踪多分钟的高能量行为（跳跃、旋转、侧手翻），并以高运动跟踪质量零样本部署到硬件上。

Conclusion: RobotDancing框架有效解决了人形机器人高动态运动跟踪中的误差累积问题，实现了从仿真到实体的成功转移。

Abstract: Long-horizon, high-dynamic motion tracking on humanoids remains brittle
because absolute joint commands cannot compensate model-plant mismatch, leading
to error accumulation. We propose RobotDancing, a simple, scalable framework
that predicts residual joint targets to explicitly correct dynamics
discrepancies. The pipeline is end-to-end--training, sim-to-sim validation, and
zero-shot sim-to-real--and uses a single-stage reinforcement learning (RL)
setup with a unified observation, reward, and hyperparameter configuration. We
evaluate primarily on Unitree G1 with retargeted LAFAN1 dance sequences and
validate transfer on H1/H1-2. RobotDancing can track multi-minute, high-energy
behaviors (jumps, spins, cartwheels) and deploys zero-shot to hardware with
high motion tracking quality.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视觉语言驱动的SLAM-free导航框架，用语义推理和轻量级拓扑表示替代传统的稠密几何建图，提高腿式机器人在快速运动、传感器漂移等挑战下的导航鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SLAM方法在腿式机器人导航中存在脆弱性，包括对快速运动敏感、校准要求高、传感器漂移问题，且缺乏语义推理能力。需要一种更鲁棒、语义驱动的导航方案。

Method: 采用分层视觉语言感知模块融合场景级和对象级信息，构建语义概率拓扑地图，结合LLM全局推理进行子目标选择，以及基于视觉的局部规划进行避障，与强化学习运动控制器集成。

Result: 在仿真和真实环境实验中，该框架在语义准确性、规划质量和导航成功率方面均表现出持续改进，消融研究验证了分层感知和精细局部规划的必要性。

Conclusion: 这项工作开创了SLAM-free、视觉语言驱动导航的新范式，将机器人探索从几何中心建图转向语义驱动决策。

Abstract: Conventional SLAM pipelines for legged robot navigation are fragile under
rapid motion, calibration demands, and sensor drift, while offering limited
semantic reasoning for task-driven exploration. To deal with these issues, we
propose a vision-only, SLAM-free navigation framework that replaces dense
geometry with semantic reasoning and lightweight topological representations. A
hierarchical vision-language perception module fuses scene-level context with
object-level cues for robust semantic inference. And a semantic-probabilistic
topological map supports coarse-to-fine planning: LLM-based global reasoning
for subgoal selection and vision-based local planning for obstacle avoidance.
Integrated with reinforcement-learning locomotion controllers, the framework is
deployable across diverse legged robot platforms. Experiments in simulation and
real-world settings demonstrate consistent improvements in semantic accuracy,
planning quality, and navigation success, while ablation studies further
showcase the necessity of both hierarchical perception and fine local planning.
This work introduces a new paradigm for SLAM-free, vision-language-driven
navigation, shifting robotic exploration from geometry-centric mapping to
semantics-driven decision making.

TL;DR: MASt3R-Fusion是一个多传感器辅助的视觉SLAM框架，通过将前馈点云图回归与惯性测量和GNSS数据紧密集成，解决了传统视觉SLAM在低纹理环境、尺度模糊和恶劣视觉条件下的性能问题。

Conclusion: MASt3R-Fusion框架成功地将前馈点云图回归与多传感器信息融合相结合，实现了实时姿态跟踪、度量尺度结构感知和全局一致的地图构建，代码将开源发布以支持可复现性研究。

Abstract: Visual SLAM is a cornerstone technique in robotics, autonomous driving and
extended reality (XR), yet classical systems often struggle with low-texture
environments, scale ambiguity, and degraded performance under challenging
visual conditions. Recent advancements in feed-forward neural network-based
pointmap regression have demonstrated the potential to recover high-fidelity 3D
scene geometry directly from images, leveraging learned spatial priors to
overcome limitations of traditional multi-view geometry methods. However, the
widely validated advantages of probabilistic multi-sensor information fusion
are often discarded in these pipelines. In this work, we propose
MASt3R-Fusion,a multi-sensor-assisted visual SLAM framework that tightly
integrates feed-forward pointmap regression with complementary sensor
information, including inertial measurements and GNSS data. The system
introduces Sim(3)-based visualalignment constraints (in the Hessian form) into
a universal metric-scale SE(3) factor graph for effective information fusion. A
hierarchical factor graph design is developed, which allows both real-time
sliding-window optimization and global optimization with aggressive loop
closures, enabling real-time pose tracking, metric-scale structure perception
and globally consistent mapping. We evaluate our approach on both public
benchmarks and self-collected datasets, demonstrating substantial improvements
in accuracy and robustness over existing visual-centered multi-sensor SLAM
systems. The code will be released open-source to support reproducibility and
further research (https://github.com/GREAT-WHU/MASt3R-Fusion).

Abstract: Multi-task reinforcement learning (MTRL) offers a promising approach to
improve sample efficiency and generalization by training agents across multiple
tasks, enabling knowledge sharing between them. However, applying MTRL to
robotics remains challenging due to the high cost of collecting diverse task
data. To address this, we propose MT-L\'evy, a novel exploration strategy that
enhances sample efficiency in MTRL environments by combining behavior sharing
across tasks with temporally extended exploration inspired by L\'evy flight.
MT-L\'evy leverages policies trained on related tasks to guide exploration
towards key states, while dynamically adjusting exploration levels based on
task success ratios. This approach enables more efficient state-space coverage,
even in complex robotics environments. Empirical results demonstrate that
MT-L\'evy significantly improves exploration and sample efficiency, supported
by quantitative and qualitative analyses. Ablation studies further highlight
the contribution of each component, showing that combining behavior sharing
with adaptive exploration strategies can significantly improve the practicality
of MTRL in robotics applications.

TL;DR: 提出SemSight模型，用于预测未知区域的语义地图，通过联合推断结构布局、全局场景上下文和目标区域分布，提升目标驱动导航和自主探索的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注单个物体或几何占据地图，缺乏对房间级语义结构的建模能力，而合理的未知区域预测对于高效导航和环境理解至关重要。

Method: 采用编码器-解码器网络架构，引入掩码约束监督策略，通过在未知区域应用二值掩码，使监督仅关注未知区域，迫使模型从观察到的上下文中推断语义结构。在2000个室内布局图上模拟前沿驱动探索，构建包含40000个序列化自我中心观察和完整语义地图的数据集。

Result: 实验结果表明，SemSight在未知区域的关键功能类别预测性能上有所提升，在结构一致性(SC)和区域识别准确率(PA)等指标上优于非掩码监督方法。在闭环模拟中提高了导航效率，减少了机器人搜索目标区域的步数。

Conclusion: SemSight模型能够有效预测多级场景语义，通过概率鸟瞰图预测方法提升了目标驱动导航和自主探索的性能，证明了掩码约束监督策略的有效性。

Abstract: In target-driven navigation and autonomous exploration, reasonable prediction
of unknown regions is crucial for efficient navigation and environment
understanding. Existing methods mostly focus on single objects or geometric
occupancy maps, lacking the ability to model room-level semantic structures. We
propose SemSight, a probabilistic bird's-eye-view prediction model for
multi-level scene semantics. The model jointly infers structural layouts,
global scene context, and target area distributions, completing semantic maps
of unexplored areas while estimating probability maps for target categories. To
train SemSight, we simulate frontier-driven exploration on 2,000 indoor layout
graphs, constructing a diverse dataset of 40,000 sequential egocentric
observations paired with complete semantic maps. We adopt an encoder-decoder
network as the core architecture and introduce a mask-constrained supervision
strategy. This strategy applies a binary mask of unexplored areas so that
supervision focuses only on unknown regions, forcing the model to infer
semantic structures from the observed context. Experimental results show that
SemSight improves prediction performance for key functional categories in
unexplored regions and outperforms non-mask-supervised approaches on metrics
such as Structural Consistency (SC) and Region Recognition Accuracy (PA). It
also enhances navigation efficiency in closed-loop simulations, reducing the
number of search steps when guiding robots toward target areas.

Abstract: End-to-end robot manipulation policies offer significant potential for
enabling embodied agents to understand and interact with the world. Unlike
traditional modular pipelines, end-to-end learning mitigates key limitations
such as information loss between modules and feature misalignment caused by
isolated optimization targets. Despite these advantages, existing end-to-end
neural networks for robotic manipulation--including those based on large
VLM/VLA models--remain insufficiently performant for large-scale practical
deployment. In this paper, we take a step towards an end-to-end manipulation
policy that is generalizable, accurate and reliable. To achieve this goal, we
propose a novel Chain of Moving Oriented Keypoints (CoMOK) formulation for
robotic manipulation. Our formulation is used as the action representation of a
neural policy, which can be trained in an end-to-end fashion. Such an action
representation is general, as it extends the standard end-effector pose action
representation and supports a diverse set of manipulation tasks in a unified
manner. The oriented keypoint in our method enables natural generalization to
objects with different shapes and sizes, while achieving sub-centimeter
accuracy. Moreover, our formulation can easily handle multi-stage tasks,
multi-modal robot behaviors, and deformable objects. Extensive simulated and
hardware experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Conclusion: MTRDrive展示了在自动驾驶领域实现更安全可靠系统的潜力，特别是在复杂场景下的鲁棒推理能力。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models(VLMs) have demonstrated significant potential for
end-to-end autonomous driving, yet a substantial gap remains between their
current capabilities and the reliability necessary for real-world deployment. A
critical challenge is their fragility, characterized by hallucinations and poor
generalization in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. To bridge this gap, we
introduce MTRDrive, a novel framework that integrates procedural driving
experiences with a dynamic toolkit to enhance generalization and proactive
decision-making.
  MTRDrive addresses these limitations through a closed-loop system that
combines a memory-based experience retrieval mechanism with dynamic toolkits.
This synergy enables the model to interact more effectively with its
environment, improving both reasoning and decision-making capabilities with the
help of our memory-tool synergistic reasoning. Additionally, we introduce a new
benchmark based on complex Roadwork construction scenarios to rigorously
evaluate zero-shot generalization.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior effectiveness of our approach.
On the public NAVSIM benchmark, our 3B-parameter MTRDrive model achieves an
exceptional PDMS of 88.3 without chain-of-thought and sets a state-of-the-art
performance bar on high-level planning, with a driving metric score of 79.8\%
and a planning accuracy of 82.6\%. Rigorous zero-shot evaluation on the new
Roadwork-VLM benchmark shows a strong ability to reason robustly in unseen
scenarios, achieving a driving metric score of 80.2\%. These results highlight
MTRDrive's potential to advance autonomous driving toward safer and more
reliable systems.

Abstract: With the maturation of differentiable physics, its role in various downstream
applications: such as model predictive control, robotic design optimization,
and neural PDE solvers, has become increasingly important. However, the
derivative information provided by differentiable simulators can exhibit abrupt
changes or vanish altogether, impeding the convergence of gradient-based
optimizers. In this work, we demonstrate that such erratic gradient behavior is
closely tied to the design of contact models. We further introduce a set of
properties that a contact model must satisfy to ensure well-behaved gradient
information. Lastly, we present a practical contact model for differentiable
rigid-body simulators that satisfies all of these properties while maintaining
computational efficiency. Our experiments show that, even from simple
initializations, our contact model can discover complex, contact-rich control
signals, enabling the successful execution of a range of downstream locomotion
and manipulation tasks.

Method: 1. 时间不变空间对齐（TISA）模块：学习将初始环境特征投影到每个未来时间步的一致自我中心框架中，无需显式的未来场景预测；2. 运动学动作预测头：预测加速度和偏航率，确保物理可行的轨迹；3. 多目标后训练阶段：使用直接偏好优化（DPO）提供针对特定驾驶行为的精细反馈。

Result: 在NAVSIM数据集上，该方法在自回归模型中达到了89.8 PDMS的最新性能，超越了现有方法。

Conclusion: 通过TISA模块解决时空错位问题，结合运动学约束和多目标优化，该方法显著提升了自动驾驶端到端规划的性能，为自回归模型在复杂驾驶场景中的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The inherent sequential modeling capabilities of autoregressive models make
them a formidable baseline for end-to-end planning in autonomous driving.
Nevertheless, their performance is constrained by a spatio-temporal
misalignment, as the planner must condition future actions on past sensory
data. This creates an inconsistent worldview, limiting the upper bound of
performance for an otherwise powerful approach. To address this, we propose a
Time-Invariant Spatial Alignment (TISA) module that learns to project initial
environmental features into a consistent ego-centric frame for each future time
step, effectively correcting the agent's worldview without explicit future
scene prediction. In addition, we employ a kinematic action prediction head
(i.e., acceleration and yaw rate) to ensure physically feasible trajectories.
Finally, we introduce a multi-objective post-training stage using Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) to move beyond pure imitation. Our approach
provides targeted feedback on specific driving behaviors, offering a more
fine-grained learning signal than the single, overall objective used in
standard DPO. Our model achieves a state-of-the-art 89.8 PDMS on the NAVSIM
dataset among autoregressive models. The video document is available at

Method: 使用模块化框架：将用户文本提示解析为结构化任务图，结合经典SLAM、语义建图、任务感知边界探索策略，以及基于SmolVLA微调的操作头进行抓取和放置规划。

Result: 在多房间实验室环境中，系统在静态场景和正常人类活动条件下达到46%的总体任务成功率，同时在嵌入式计算平台上保持实时运行。

Conclusion: 通过将经典导航堆栈与微调VLA操作相结合，系统继承了基于几何导航的可靠性，同时获得了语言条件操作的灵活性和任务泛化能力。

Abstract: We address natural language pick-and-place in unseen, unpredictable indoor
environments with AnywhereVLA, a modular framework for mobile manipulation. A
user text prompt serves as an entry point and is parsed into a structured task
graph that conditions classical SLAM with LiDAR and cameras, metric semantic
mapping, and a task-aware frontier exploration policy. An approach planner then
selects visibility and reachability aware pre grasp base poses. For
interaction, a compact SmolVLA manipulation head is fine tuned on platform pick
and place trajectories for the SO-101 by TheRobotStudio, grounding local visual
context and sub-goals into grasp and place proposals. The full system runs
fully onboard on consumer-level hardware, with Jetson Orin NX for perception
and VLA and an Intel NUC for SLAM, exploration, and control, sustaining
real-time operation. We evaluated AnywhereVLA in a multi-room lab under static
scenes and normal human motion. In this setting, the system achieves a $46\%$
overall task success rate while maintaining throughput on embedded compute. By
combining a classical stack with a fine-tuned VLA manipulation, the system
inherits the reliability of geometry-based navigation with the agility and task

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电动汽车电池拆解需要精确的多机器人协调、短而可靠的运动以及在杂乱动态场景中的鲁棒碰撞安全。现有方法在路径紧凑性和安全性方面存在不足。

Method: 采用四层TAMP框架，结合符号任务规划和成本可及性感知分配，使用TP-GMM引导的从演示学习的运动规划器。通过立体视觉和YOLOv8进行实时组件定位，OctoMap 3D映射和FCL碰撞检测实现预测性数字孪生碰撞检查。

Result: 在UR10e机器人上的验证显示，相比默认RRTConnect基线，末端执行器路径长度平均减少63.3%，总完成时间减少8.1%，机械臂扫掠体积显著缩小（R1: 0.583→0.139 m³; R2: 0.696→0.252 m³），相互重叠减少47%。

Conclusion: 该方法在非结构化动态环境中显著提高了多机器人EV电池拆解的自主性、精确性和安全性，为工业应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Electric-vehicle (EV) battery disassembly requires precise multi-robot
coordination, short and reliable motions, and robust collision safety in
cluttered, dynamic scenes. We propose a four-layer task-and-motion planning
(TAMP) framework that couples symbolic task planning and cost- and
accessibility-aware allocation with a TP-GMM-guided motion planner learned from
demonstrations. Stereo vision with YOLOv8 provides real-time component
localization, while OctoMap-based 3D mapping and FCL(Flexible Collision
Library) checks in MoveIt unify predictive digital-twin collision checking with
reactive, vision-based avoidance. Validated on two UR10e robots across cable,
busbar, service plug, and three leaf-cell removals, the approach yields
substantially more compact and safer motions than a default RRTConnect baseline
under identical perception and task assignments: average end-effector path
length drops by $-63.3\%$ and makespan by $-8.1\%$; per-arm swept volumes
shrink (R1: $0.583\rightarrow0.139\,\mathrm{m}^3$; R2:
$0.696\rightarrow0.252\,\mathrm{m}^3$), and mutual overlap decreases by $47\%$
($0.064\rightarrow0.034\,\mathrm{m}^3$). These results highlight improved

TL;DR: KeyWorld是一个改进文本条件机器人世界模型的框架，通过专注于语义关键帧来加速推理并提高生成轨迹的物理合理性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机器人世界模型存在推理速度慢和生成轨迹物理合理性不足的问题，主要原因是帧到帧生成方法的冗余性以及忽略了关键转换的语义重要性。

Method: KeyWorld首先通过迭代简化机器人运动轨迹识别关键帧，然后训练DiT模型从文本任务描述生成这些关键帧，最后使用轻量级插值器重建完整视频。

Result: 在LIBERO基准测试中，KeyWorld相比帧到帧生成基线实现了5.68倍的加速，并且关键帧方法提高了生成视频的物理有效性，特别是在复杂任务上。

Conclusion: 该方法为在实时机器人控制和其他需要高效有效世界模型的领域中部署世界模型提供了一条实用路径。

Abstract: Robotic world models are a promising paradigm for forecasting future
environment states, yet their inference speed and the physical plausibility of
generated trajectories remain critical bottlenecks, limiting their real-world
applications. This stems from the redundancy of the prevailing frame-to-frame
generation approach, where the model conducts costly computation on similar
frames, as well as neglecting the semantic importance of key transitions. To
address this inefficiency, we propose KeyWorld, a framework that improves
text-conditioned robotic world models by concentrating transformers computation
on a few semantic key frames while employing a lightweight convolutional model
to fill the intermediate frames. Specifically, KeyWorld first identifies
significant transitions by iteratively simplifying the robot's motion
trajectories, obtaining the ground truth key frames. Then, a DiT model is
trained to reason and generate these physically meaningful key frames from
textual task descriptions. Finally, a lightweight interpolator efficiently
reconstructs the full video by inpainting all intermediate frames. Evaluations
on the LIBERO benchmark demonstrate that KeyWorld achieves a 5.68$\times$
acceleration compared to the frame-to-frame generation baseline, and focusing
on the motion-aware key frames further contributes to the physical validity of
the generated videos, especially on complex tasks. Our approach highlights a
practical path toward deploying world models in real-time robotic control and
other domains requiring both efficient and effective world models. Code is

Abstract: This paper presents an integrated Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Model
Predictive Control (MPC) framework for autonomous satellite docking with a
partially filled fuel tank. Traditional docking control faces challenges due to
fuel sloshing in microgravity, which induces unpredictable forces affecting
stability. To address this, we integrate Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and
Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) RL algorithms with MPC, leveraging MPC's predictive
capabilities to accelerate RL training and improve control robustness. The
proposed approach is validated through Zero-G Lab of SnT experiments for planar
stabilization and high-fidelity numerical simulations for 6-DOF docking with
fuel sloshing dynamics. Simulation results demonstrate that SAC-MPC achieves
superior docking accuracy, higher success rates, and lower control effort,
outperforming standalone RL and PPO-MPC methods. This study advances
fuel-efficient and disturbance-resilient satellite docking, enhancing the
feasibility of on-orbit refueling and servicing missions.

Conclusion: 归一化流是扩散模型的自然且强大的替代方案，能够提供可信度测量和高效推理，适用于通用机器人领域。

Abstract: The field of general purpose robotics has recently embraced powerful
probabilistic models, such as diffusion models, to model and learn complex
behaviors. However, these models often come with significant trade-offs, namely
high computational costs for inference and a fundamental inability to quantify
output uncertainty. We argue that a model's trustworthiness, a critical factor
for reliable, general-purpose robotics, is inherently linked to its ability to
provide confidence measures.
  In this work, we introduce Normalizing Flows Policy, a novel visuomotor
policy learning model based on Normalizing Flows. We show that Normalizing
Flows are a natural and powerful alternative to diffusion models, providing
both a statistically sound measure of confidence and a highly efficient
inference process. Through comprehensive experiments across four distinct
simulated robotic tasks, we demonstrate that Normalizing Flows Policy achieves
performance comparable to, and often surpassing, Diffusion Policy, and it does
so not only with improved sample efficiency but also with up to 30 times faster
inference. Additionally, our ablation study validates several key architectural
and training techniques that enable Normalizing Flows to perform well in this
domain.

Abstract: Drone-based rapid and accurate environmental edge detection is highly
advantageous for tasks such as disaster relief and autonomous navigation.
Current methods, using radars or cameras, raise deployment costs and burden
lightweight drones with high computational demands. In this paper, we propose
AirTouch, a system that transforms the ground effect from a stability "foe" in
traditional flight control views, into a "friend" for accurate and efficient
edge detection. Our key insight is that analyzing drone basic attitude sensor
readings and flight commands allows us to detect ground effect changes. Such
changes typically indicate the drone flying over a boundary of two materials,
making this information valuable for edge detection. We approach this insight
through theoretical analysis, algorithm design, and implementation, fully
leveraging the ground effect as a new sensing modality without compromising
drone flight stability, thereby achieving accurate and efficient scene edge
detection. We also compare this new sensing modality with vision-based methods
to clarify its exclusive advantages in resource efficiency and detection
capability. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our system achieves a high
detection accuracy with mean detection distance errors of 0.051m, outperforming
the baseline method performance by 86%. With such detection performance, our
system requires only 43 mW power consumption, contributing to this new sensing
modality for low-cost and highly efficient edge detection.

Motivation: 传统机器人行为教学需要运动演示（遥操作或物理引导），数据收集繁琐且难以扩展，需要更高效的替代方法

Method: CrossInstruct框架将跨模态指令作为示例输入基础VLM，VLM迭代查询小型微调模型，在多视角下合成运动轨迹，然后融合为3D运动分布，并结合强化学习管道

Result: 在基准模拟任务和真实硬件上验证了有效性，无需额外微调，并为后续强化学习提供了良好的初始化

Conclusion: 该方法能够生成可执行的机器人行为，并泛化到有限指令示例之外的环境，为机器人学习提供了新的范式

Abstract: Teaching robots novel behaviors typically requires motion demonstrations via
teleoperation or kinaesthetic teaching, that is, physically guiding the robot.
While recent work has explored using human sketches to specify desired
behaviors, data collection remains cumbersome, and demonstration datasets are
difficult to scale. In this paper, we introduce an alternative paradigm,
Learning from Cross-Modal Instructions, where robots are shaped by
demonstrations in the form of rough annotations, which can contain free-form
text labels, and are used in lieu of physical motion. We introduce the
CrossInstruct framework, which integrates cross-modal instructions as examples
into the context input to a foundational vision-language model (VLM). The VLM
then iteratively queries a smaller, fine-tuned model, and synthesizes the
desired motion over multiple 2D views. These are then subsequently fused into a
coherent distribution over 3D motion trajectories in the robot's workspace. By
incorporating the reasoning of the large VLM with a fine-grained pointing
model, CrossInstruct produces executable robot behaviors that generalize beyond
the environment of in the limited set of instruction examples. We then
introduce a downstream reinforcement learning pipeline that leverages
CrossInstruct outputs to efficiently learn policies to complete fine-grained
tasks. We rigorously evaluate CrossInstruct on benchmark simulation tasks and
real hardware, demonstrating effectiveness without additional fine-tuning and
providing a strong initialization for policies subsequently refined via
reinforcement learning.

Motivation: 解决无人机通过缆绳交互稳定平衡球的复杂控制问题，探索强化学习在分层控制框架中的优势。

Method: 采用分层控制框架，将高层平衡策略与底层无人机控制解耦，使用强化学习训练高层决策策略，并与精心调谐的PID控制器进行对比。

Result: 仿真结果表明，强化学习策略在相同分层结构下优于PID控制器，其优势主要来自于有效利用更丰富的状态观测信息。

Conclusion: 强化学习的优势不在于改进的参数调谐或非线性映射能力，而在于充分利用状态信息的能力，这强调了全面状态表示在学习型系统中的重要性。

Abstract: This paper addresses a drone ball-balancing task, in which a drone stabilizes
a ball atop a movable beam through cable-based interaction. We propose a
hierarchical control framework that decouples high-level balancing policy from
low-level drone control, and train a reinforcement learning (RL) policy to
handle the high-level decision-making. Simulation results show that the RL
policy achieves superior performance compared to carefully tuned PID
controllers within the same hierarchical structure. Through systematic
comparative analysis, we demonstrate that RL's advantage stems not from
improved parameter tuning or inherent nonlinear mapping capabilities, but from
its ability to effectively utilize richer state observations. These findings
underscore the critical role of comprehensive state representation in
learning-based systems and suggest that enhanced sensing could be instrumental
in improving controller performance.

Abstract: Multimodal agents have demonstrated strong performance in general GUI
interactions, but their application in automotive systems has been largely
unexplored. In-vehicle GUIs present distinct challenges: drivers' limited
attention, strict safety requirements, and complex location-based interaction
patterns. To address these challenges, we introduce Automotive-ENV, the first
high-fidelity benchmark and interaction environment tailored for vehicle GUIs.
This platform defines 185 parameterized tasks spanning explicit control,
implicit intent understanding, and safety-aware tasks, and provides structured
multimodal observations with precise programmatic checks for reproducible
evaluation. Building on this benchmark, we propose ASURADA, a geo-aware
multimodal agent that integrates GPS-informed context to dynamically adjust
actions based on location, environmental conditions, and regional driving
norms. Experiments show that geo-aware information significantly improves
success on safety-aware tasks, highlighting the importance of location-based
context in automotive environments. We will release Automotive-ENV, complete
with all tasks and benchmarking tools, to further the development of safe and
adaptive in-vehicle agents.

Conclusion: DAGDiff能够为未见过的物体生成可靠的双臂抓取配置，在异构双臂设置中成功执行抓取和提升操作。

Abstract: Reliable dual-arm grasping is essential for manipulating large and complex
objects but remains a challenging problem due to stability, collision, and
generalization requirements. Prior methods typically decompose the task into
two independent grasp proposals, relying on region priors or heuristics that
limit generalization and provide no principled guarantee of stability. We
propose DAGDiff, an end-to-end framework that directly denoises to grasp pairs
in the SE(3) x SE(3) space. Our key insight is that stability and collision can
be enforced more effectively by guiding the diffusion process with classifier
signals, rather than relying on explicit region detection or object priors. To
this end, DAGDiff integrates geometry-, stability-, and collision-aware
guidance terms that steer the generative process toward grasps that are
physically valid and force-closure compliant. We comprehensively evaluate
DAGDiff through analytical force-closure checks, collision analysis, and
large-scale physics-based simulations, showing consistent improvements over
previous work on these metrics. Finally, we demonstrate that our framework
generates dual-arm grasps directly on real-world point clouds of previously
unseen objects, which are executed on a heterogeneous dual-arm setup where two
manipulators reliably grasp and lift them.

Result: 在真实和模拟导航任务上的评估显示，代理成功运用高阶推理在大型复杂建筑中高效导航。

Conclusion: ReasonNav系统通过整合人类导航行为，显著提升了机器人在大型环境中的导航效率。

Abstract: When navigating in a man-made environment they haven't visited before--like
an office building--humans employ behaviors such as reading signs and asking
others for directions. These behaviors help humans reach their destinations
efficiently by reducing the need to search through large areas. Existing robot
navigation systems lack the ability to execute such behaviors and are thus
highly inefficient at navigating within large environments. We present
ReasonNav, a modular navigation system which integrates these human-like
navigation skills by leveraging the reasoning capabilities of a vision-language
model (VLM). We design compact input and output abstractions based on
navigation landmarks, allowing the VLM to focus on language understanding and
reasoning. We evaluate ReasonNav on real and simulated navigation tasks and
show that the agent successfully employs higher-order reasoning to navigate
efficiently in large, complex buildings.

Conclusion: SEEC框架实现了精确鲁棒的末端执行器稳定控制，能够适应不同运动控制器，为人形机器人操作任务提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Arm end-effector stabilization is essential for humanoid loco-manipulation
tasks, yet it remains challenging due to the high degrees of freedom and
inherent dynamic instability of bipedal robot structures. Previous model-based
controllers achieve precise end-effector control but rely on precise dynamics
modeling and estimation, which often struggle to capture real-world factors
(e.g., friction and backlash) and thus degrade in practice. On the other hand,
learning-based methods can better mitigate these factors via exploration and
domain randomization, and have shown potential in real-world use. However, they
often overfit to training conditions, requiring retraining with the entire
body, and still struggle to adapt to unseen scenarios. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel stable end-effector control (SEEC) framework
with model-enhanced residual learning that learns to achieve precise and robust
end-effector compensation for lower-body induced disturbances through
model-guided reinforcement learning (RL) with a perturbation generator. This
design allows the upper-body policy to achieve accurate end-effector
stabilization as well as adapt to unseen locomotion controllers with no
additional training. We validate our framework in different simulators and
transfer trained policies to the Booster T1 humanoid robot. Experiments
demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms baselines and robustly
handles diverse and demanding loco-manipulation tasks.

Motivation: 现有商业手套仅提供21个自由度，无法捕捉复杂操作且忽略了对接触密集型任务至关重要的形状变化。

Method: 每个手指关节和手背配备IMU传感器，通过DiffHCal方法与参数化MANO模型集成，通过可微分优化解决关节运动学、形状参数和传感器错位问题。

Result: 系统达到最先进精度，关节角度误差小于2.7度，在形状重建和接触保真度方面优于商业替代方案。

Conclusion: FSGlove的开源硬件和软件设计确保与当前VR和机器人生态系统的兼容性，其捕捉细微运动的能力弥合了人类灵巧性和机器人模仿之间的差距。

Abstract: Accurate hand motion capture (MoCap) is vital for applications in robotics,
virtual reality, and biomechanics, yet existing systems face limitations in
capturing high-degree-of-freedom (DoF) joint kinematics and personalized hand
shape. Commercial gloves offer up to 21 DoFs, which are insufficient for
complex manipulations while neglecting shape variations that are critical for
contact-rich tasks. We present FSGlove, an inertial-based system that
simultaneously tracks up to 48 DoFs and reconstructs personalized hand shapes
via DiffHCal, a novel calibration method. Each finger joint and the dorsum are
equipped with IMUs, enabling high-resolution motion sensing. DiffHCal
integrates with the parametric MANO model through differentiable optimization,
resolving joint kinematics, shape parameters, and sensor misalignment during a
single streamlined calibration. The system achieves state-of-the-art accuracy,
with joint angle errors of less than 2.7 degree, and outperforms commercial
alternatives in shape reconstruction and contact fidelity. FSGlove's
open-source hardware and software design ensures compatibility with current VR
and robotics ecosystems, while its ability to capture subtle motions (e.g.,
fingertip rubbing) bridges the gap between human dexterity and robotic
imitation. Evaluated against Nokov optical MoCap, FSGlove advances hand
tracking by unifying the kinematic and contact fidelity. Hardware design,

### [56] [RetoVLA: Reusing Register Tokens for Spatial Reasoning in Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21243)
*Jiyeon Koo,Taewan Cho,Hyunjoon Kang,Eunseom Pyo,Tae Gyun Oh,Taeryang Kim,Andrew Jaeyong Choi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RetoVLA是一种轻量级视觉-语言-动作模型，通过重用Vision Transformer中被丢弃的Register Tokens来增强空间推理能力，在保持轻量化的同时显著提升了机器人复杂操作任务的成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的VLA模型虽然表现出色，但体积庞大、计算成本高，限制了实际部署。传统的轻量化方法往往牺牲了关键的空间推理能力，需要在效率和性能之间做出权衡。

Method: 提出RetoVLA架构，重用Vision Transformer中原本用于去除伪影后被丢弃的Register Tokens，将这些包含重要空间信息的tokens直接注入到Action Expert中。

Result: 在7自由度机器人手臂上的实验显示，RetoVLA在复杂操作任务中实现了17.1%的绝对成功率提升，证明了重用Register Tokens的有效性。

Conclusion: 被丢弃的Register Tokens实际上是宝贵的空间信息资源，重用这些tokens能够在不牺牲轻量化优势的情况下显著增强机器人的空间推理能力。

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models demonstrate remarkable
generalization in robotics but are restricted by their substantial size and
computational cost, limiting real-world deployment. However, conventional
lightweighting methods often sacrifice critical capabilities, particularly
spatial reasoning. This creates a trade-off between efficiency and performance.
To address this challenge, our work reuses Register Tokens, which were
introduced for artifact removal in Vision Transformers but subsequently
discarded. We suppose that these tokens contain essential spatial information
and propose RetoVLA, a novel architecture that reuses them directly by
injecting them into the Action Expert.
  RetoVLA maintains a lightweight structure while leveraging this repurposed
spatial context to enhance reasoning. We demonstrate RetoVLA's effectiveness
through a series of comprehensive experiments. On our custom-built 7-DOF robot
arm, the model achieves a 17.1%p absolute improvement in success rates for
complex manipulation tasks. Our results confirm that reusing Register Tokens
directly enhances spatial reasoning, demonstrating that what was previously
discarded as an artifact is in fact a valuable, unexplored resource for robotic
intelligence. A video demonstration is available at:

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种双手机器人非抓取操作框架BiNoMaP，通过三阶段无强化学习方法从视频演示中学习可泛化的操作技能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非抓取操作（如推、戳、旋转）在机器人领域研究不足，传统方法依赖单臂配置或外部辅助设施，缺乏通用性和泛化能力。

Method: 1）从视频中提取双手运动轨迹；2）几何感知后优化算法精炼轨迹；3）参数化学习到的操作原语，实现类别级泛化。

Result: 在多种双手机器人任务和物体类别上验证了BiNoMaP的有效性、效率、多功能性和优越的泛化能力。

Conclusion: BiNoMaP框架为非抓取操作提供了新的解决方案，突破了传统方法的限制，实现了从实例级复制到类别级泛化的能力。

Abstract: Non-prehensile manipulation, encompassing ungraspable actions such as
pushing, poking, and pivoting, represents a critical yet underexplored domain
in robotics due to its contact-rich and analytically intractable nature. In
this work, we revisit this problem from two novel perspectives. First, we move
beyond the usual single-arm setup and the strong assumption of favorable
external dexterity such as walls, ramps, or edges. Instead, we advocate a
generalizable dual-arm configuration and establish a suite of Bimanual
Non-prehensile Manipulation Primitives (BiNoMaP). Second, we depart from the
prevailing RL-based paradigm and propose a three-stage, RL-free framework to
learn non-prehensile skills. Specifically, we begin by extracting bimanual hand
motion trajectories from video demonstrations. Due to visual inaccuracies and
morphological gaps, these coarse trajectories are difficult to transfer
directly to robotic end-effectors. To address this, we propose a geometry-aware
post-optimization algorithm that refines raw motions into executable
manipulation primitives that conform to specific motion patterns. Beyond
instance-level reproduction, we further enable category-level generalization by
parameterizing the learned primitives with object-relevant geometric
attributes, particularly size, resulting in adaptable and general parameterized
manipulation primitives. We validate BiNoMaP across a range of representative
bimanual tasks and diverse object categories, demonstrating its effectiveness,
efficiency, versatility, and superior generalization capability.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GMP³是一个多阶段全局路径规划框架，为无人机在复杂环境中生成动态可行的三维轨迹，通过扩展到SE(3)李群联合学习平移运动和旋转动力学，采用分布式共识方案实现协同策略更新。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统路径规划方法主要关注欧几里得位置空间，难以处理无人机在三维复杂环境中的姿态动力学约束，需要开发能够同时考虑位置和姿态的规划框架。

Method: 提出基于改进Bellman算子的强化学习方法，将路径规划扩展到SE(3)李群，采用分布式框架让多个智能体通过共识方案协同优化轨迹段，并开发DroneManager软件实现与真实无人机平台的实时部署。

Result: 仿真和室内飞行实验验证了该方法在受限3D环境中的有效性，能够实现可靠的避障和平滑可行的位置-姿态轨迹。

Conclusion: GMP³框架成功解决了无人机在复杂3D环境中的动态轨迹规划问题，通过分布式协同学习和SE(3)空间扩展，为实际无人机应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose $\text{GMP}^{3}$, a multiphase global path planning framework that
generates dynamically feasible three-dimensional trajectories for unmanned
aerial vehicles (UAVs) operating in cluttered environments. The framework
extends traditional path planning from Euclidean position spaces to the Lie
group $\mathrm{SE}(3)$, allowing joint learning of translational motion and
rotational dynamics. A modified Bellman-based operator is introduced to support
reinforcement learning (RL) policy updates while leveraging prior trajectory
information for improved convergence. $\text{GMP}^{3}$ is designed as a
distributed framework in which agents influence each other and share policy
information along the trajectory: each agent refines its assigned segment and
shares with its neighbors via a consensus-based scheme, enabling cooperative
policy updates and convergence toward a path shaped globally even under
kinematic constraints. We also propose DroneManager, a modular ground control
software that interfaces the planner with real UAV platforms via the MAVLink
protocol, supporting real-time deployment and feedback. Simulation studies and
indoor flight experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in
constrained 3D environments, demonstrating reliable obstacle avoidance and
smooth, feasible trajectories across both position and orientation. The
open-source implementation is available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为GPHDM的新方法，通过将高斯过程动力学模型扩展到双曲流形并结合分类学感知的归纳偏置，生成既保持运动层次结构又具有物理一致性的机器人运动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机器人运动生成模型往往忽略了人类运动分类学提供的丰富层次结构信息，导致生成的运动与底层层次结构脱节。

Method: 通过扩展GPDM的动态先验到双曲流形，并整合分类学感知的归纳偏置，提出了三种新颖的运动生成机制：两种概率递归方法和基于拉回度量测地线的方法。

Result: 在手部抓取分类学上的实验表明，GPHDM能够忠实编码底层分类学和时序动态，并生成新颖的物理一致轨迹。

Conclusion: GPHDM成功地将运动层次结构与物理一致性相结合，为机器人运动生成提供了更符合生物力学原理的方法。

Abstract: Human-like motion generation for robots often draws inspiration from
biomechanical studies, which often categorize complex human motions into
hierarchical taxonomies. While these taxonomies provide rich structural
information about how movements relate to one another, this information is
frequently overlooked in motion generation models, leading to a disconnect
between the generated motions and their underlying hierarchical structure. This
paper introduces the \ac{gphdm}, a novel approach that learns latent
representations preserving both the hierarchical structure of motions and their
temporal dynamics to ensure physical consistency. Our model achieves this by
extending the dynamics prior of the Gaussian Process Dynamical Model (GPDM) to
the hyperbolic manifold and integrating it with taxonomy-aware inductive
biases. Building on this geometry- and taxonomy-aware frameworks, we propose
three novel mechanisms for generating motions that are both
taxonomically-structured and physically-consistent: two probabilistic recursive
approaches and a method based on pullback-metric geodesics. Experiments on
generating realistic motion sequences on the hand grasping taxonomy show that
the proposed GPHDM faithfully encodes the underlying taxonomy and temporal
dynamics, and generates novel physically-consistent trajectories.

### [60] [The First Open-Source Framework for Learning Stability Certificate from Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20392)
*Zhe Shen*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 首个开源框架，能够从噪声飞行数据中学习李雅普诺夫稳定性证书，无需控制器逻辑即可验证系统稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在控制器逻辑未知的黑盒系统中，如何直接从噪声数据验证系统稳定性的问题，特别是在商业飞机等专有系统中的应用。

Method: 开发数据驱动方法，从轨迹数据中学习李雅普诺夫函数，即使在噪声污染条件下也能工作，无需访问控制器内部逻辑。

Result: 应用于2024年SAS严重湍流事件数据，发现在飞机下降异常后60秒内无法构建李雅普诺夫函数证明系统稳定性。

Conclusion: 这是首个应用于民航事故的数据驱动稳定性理论方法，为专有不透明控制系统提供了突破性的稳定性验证工具。

Abstract: Before 2025, no open-source system existed that could learn Lyapunov
stability certificates directly from noisy, real-world flight data. No tool
could answer the critical question: is this controller still
stabilizable-especially when its closed-loop system is a total black box. We
broke that boundary. This year, we released the first-ever open-source
framework that can learn Lyapunov functions from trajectory data under
realistic, noise-corrupted conditions. Unlike statistical anomaly detectors,
our method does not merely flag deviations-it directly determines whether the
system can still be proven stable. Applied to public data from the 2024 SAS
severe turbulence incident, our method revealed that, within just 60 seconds of
the aircrafts descent becoming abnormal, no Lyapunov function could be
constructed to certify system stability. Moreover, this is the first known
data-driven stability-theoretic method ever applied to a civil airliner
accident. And our approach works with zero access to the controller logic-a
breakthrough for commercial aircraft where control laws are proprietary and
opaque. The implementation of the proposed framework is open-sourced and
available at: https://github.com/HansOersted/stability

*Tasnia Noboni,Tuhin Das*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于系留多旋翼自转旋翼机的自适应高度控制策略，通过估计俯仰角与平衡高度之间的二次函数系数来实现高度控制和最大高度跟踪。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 系留多旋翼自转旋翼机可以利用风能实现节能和长时间部署，但需要有效的控制策略来维持稳定飞行并适应变化的风速条件。

Method: 采用基于再生差动转子制动的反馈控制器来调节自转旋翼机的俯仰角，并通过自适应控制估计俯仰角与平衡高度之间的二次函数系数。

Result: 基于控制导向的高阶动态模型实现表明，该控制器能够在变化的风速下有效调节高度并维持稳定飞行。

Conclusion: 自适应控制策略能够根据系统的最大高度跟踪性能进行调整，在风速显著变化时改善控制性能，实现最大高度和最小水平漂移的目标。

Abstract: A tethered multirotor autogyro can function as an unmanned aerial vehicle for
energy-efficient and prolonged deployment, as it uses the available wind energy
to sustain flight. This article presents an adaptive altitude control strategy
for such a device. At a constant wind speed, the equilibrium altitude can be
approximated by a quadratic function of the pitch angle. The proposed adaptive
control estimates the coefficients of this quadratic function. The estimates
are used for altitude control and to attain the maximum altitude (and minimum
horizontal drift) for a given wind speed. A feedback controller based on
regenerative differential rotor braking is used as the actuation to modulate
the autogyro's pitch angle. Implementation of the controller using a
control-oriented, higher-order dynamic model demonstrates the controller's
capability to regulate the altitude and maintain stable flights under varying
wind speeds. Based on the system's maximum altitude tracking performance, the
adaptive control is adjusted to improve performance under substantial changes
in wind speeds.

Conclusion: 该方法为非线性系统的数据驱动状态观测器设计提供了有效的框架，特别是在不同数据可用性场景下都能实现观测器合成。

Abstract: The increasing use of data-driven control strategies gives rise to the
problem of learning-based state observation. Motivated by this need, the
present work proposes a data-driven approach for the synthesis of state
observers for discrete-time nonlinear systems with measure-preserving dynamics.
To this end, Kazantzis-Kravaris/Luenburger (KKL) observers are shown to be
well-defined, where the observer design boils down to determining a nonlinear
injective mapping of states and its pseudo-inverse. For its learning-based
construction, the KKL observer is related to the Koopman and Perron-Frobenius
operators, defined on a Sobolev-type reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) on
which they are shown to be normal operators and thus have a spectral
resolution. Hence, observer synthesis algorithms, based on kernel
interpolation/regression routines for the desired injective mapping in the
observer and its pseudo-inverse, have been proposed in various settings of
available dataset -- (i) many orbits, (ii) single long orbit, and (iii)
snapshots. Theoretical error analyses are provided, and numerical studies on a
chaotic Lorenz system are demonstrated.

Abstract: In this article, we investigate small-signal frequency and DC voltage
stability of hybrid AC/DC power systems that combine AC and DC transmission,
conventional machine- based generation, and converter-interfaced generation.
The main contributions of this work are a compact frequency domain
representation of hybrid AC/DC systems and associated stability conditions that
can be divided into conditions on the individual bus dynamics and conditions on
each DC network. The bus- level conditions apply to a wide range of
technologies (e.g., synchronous generators, synchronous condensers,
grid-forming renewables and energy storage). Moreover, the system-level
conditions establish that hybrid AC/DC systems combining a wide range of
devices are stable independently of the network topology provided that the
frequency response of converters on each DC network is sufficiently coherent
relative to the network coupling strength. Additionally, we develop and
validate a novel reduced- order damper winding model for multi-machine systems.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 本文分析了自适应巡航控制（ACC）、协同自适应巡航控制（CACC）及其增强版本（CACC+）系统在存在寄生驱动延迟时的最小可用时间间隔要求，并基于庞特里亚金交错定理分析了内部稳定性对串稳定性的影响。

Motivation: 寄生驱动延迟难以建模且参数难以获取，这些延迟会对联网自动驾驶车辆（CAVs）的移动性和安全性产生不利影响。需要确保在已知延迟上界内，系统同时满足内部稳定性和串稳定性。

Method: 基于庞特里亚金交错定理分析时间延迟系统的内部稳定性对串稳定性的影响，推导出ACC、CACC和CACC+系统的最小可用时间间隔，并通过数值结果验证理论分析。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效处理寄生驱动延迟对CAVs稳定性的影响，为实际系统设计提供了理论指导，数值结果验证了理论分析的正确性。

Abstract: Adaptive andcooperative adaptive cruise control (ACC and CACC) and next
generation CACC (CACC+) systems usually employ a constant time headway policy
(CTHP) for platooning of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs). In ACC, the
ego vehicle uses onboard sensors to measure the position and velocity of the
predecessor vehicle to maintain a desired spacing. The CACC and CACC+systems
use additional information, such as acceleration(s) communicated through
vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication of the predecessor vehicle(s); these
systems have been shown to result in improved spacing performance, throughput,
and safety over ACC. Parasitic dynamics are generally difficult to model and
the parasitic parameters (delay, lag, etc.) are difficult to obtain. Parasitic
actuation delays can have deleterious effects and impose limits on the mobility
and safety of CAVs. It is reasonable to assume that the bounds on parasitic
actuation delays are known a priori. For CAVs, we need to address both internal
stability and string stability in the presence of parasitic actuation delays.
This requires robustness of string and internal stability for all values of
parasitic actuation delays that are within the specified upper bound. In this
paper, we provide the minimum employable time headway for ACC, CACC, and CACC+
(`r' predecessors look-ahead), respectively. The inclusion of the internal
stability in the string stability condition is analyzed based on Pontryagin's
interlacing theorem for time delay systems. We provide comparative numerical
results to corroborate the achieved theoretical results.

Abstract: Identifying an optimal set of driver nodes to achieve synchronization via
pinning control is a fundamental challenge in complex network science, limited
by computational intractability and the lack of general theory. Here,
leveraging a degree-based mean-field (annealed) approximation from statistical
physics, we analytically reveal how the structural degree distribution
systematically governs synchronization performance, and derive an analytic
characterization of the globally optimal pinning set and constructive
algorithms with linear complexity (dominated by degree sorting, O(N+M). The
optimal configuration exhibits a chaotic dependence--a discontinuous
sensitivity--on its cardinality, whereby adding a single node can trigger
abrupt changes in node composition and control effectiveness. This structural
transition fundamentally challenges traditional heuristics that assume
monotonic performance gains with budget. Systematic experiments on synthetic
and empirical networks confirm that the proposed approach consistently
outperforms degree-, betweenness-, and other centrality-based baselines.
Furthermore, we quantify how key degree-distribution features--low-degree
saturation, high-degree cutoff, and the power-law exponent--govern achievable
synchronizability and shape the form of optimal sets. These results offer a
systematic understanding of how degree heterogeneity shapes the network
controllability. Our work establishes a unified link between degree
heterogeneity and spectral controllability, offering both mechanistic insights
and practical design rules for optimal driver-node selection in diverse complex
systems.

Conclusion: 该天线设计成功实现了双频端射滤波辐射、柔性共形和低剖面等优势，适用于应急通信系统的集成应用。

Abstract: In this letter, a single-layer dual-band flexible conformal filtering endfire
antenna is presented. The proposed antenna is based on two co-designed folded
dipoles (FDs) working at two frequencies, where the lower-frequency FD acts as
a reflector for the higher-frequency one. Then, by devising an additional
reflector for lower-frequency FD, dual-band endfire radiation is realized.
Parasitic strips are deliberately introduced around the FDs to generate
electric coupling and magnetic coupling in the two operating bands, resulting
in significant filtering performance with four radiation nulls. With flexible
structure and single-layer configuration, the antenna design exhibits flexible
conformability with cylindrical surfaces of diverse diameters, thereby enabling
seamless integration into scalable emergency communication systems. To verify
our design concept, an antenna prototype is fabricated and measured. The
measured working frequency ranges from 1.37 to 1.45 GHz and 1.89 to 2.07 GHz.
Out-of-band radiation suppression more than 11 dB is achieved under different
bending radii. The proposed design offers several advantages including
dual-band endfire filtering radiation, flexible conformability and low-profile.

Abstract: We consider an 1D partial integro-differential equation (PIDE) comprising of
an 1D parabolic partial differential equation (PDE) and a nonlocal integral
term. The control input is applied on one of the boundaries of the PIDE.
Partitioning the spatial interval into $n+1$ subintervals and approximating the
spatial derivatives and the integral term with their finite-difference
approximations and Riemann sum, respectively, we derive an $n^{\rm th}$-order
semi-discrete approximation of the PIDE. The $n^{\rm th}$-order semi-discrete
approximation of the PIDE is an $n^{\rm th}$-order ordinary differential
equation (ODE) in time. We establish some of its salient properties and using
them prove that the solution of the semi-discrete approximation converges to
the solution of the PIDE as $n\to\infty$. We illustrate our convergence results
using numerical examples. The results in this work are useful for establishing
the null controllability of the PIDE considered.

Abstract: Recently, the outstanding performance reached by neural networks in many
tasks has led to their deployment in autonomous systems, such as robots and
vehicles. However, neural networks are not yet trustworthy, being prone to
different types of misbehavior, such as anomalous samples, distribution shifts,
adversarial attacks, and other threats. Furthermore, frameworks for
accelerating the inference of neural networks typically run on rich operating
systems that are less predictable in terms of timing behavior and present
larger surfaces for cyber-attacks.
  To address these issues, this paper presents a software architecture for
enhancing safety, security, and predictability levels of learning-based
autonomous systems. It leverages two isolated execution domains, one dedicated
to the execution of neural networks under a rich operating system, which is
deemed not trustworthy, and one responsible for running safety-critical
functions, possibly under a different operating system capable of handling
real-time constraints.
  Both domains are hosted on the same computing platform and isolated through a
type-1 real-time hypervisor enabling fast and predictable inter-domain
communication to exchange real-time data. The two domains cooperate to provide
a fail-safe mechanism based on a safety monitor, which oversees the state of
the system and switches to a simpler but safer backup module, hosted in the
safety-critical domain, whenever its behavior is considered untrustworthy.
  The effectiveness of the proposed architecture is illustrated by a set of
experiments performed on two control systems: a Furuta pendulum and a rover.
The results confirm the utility of the fall-back mechanism in preventing faults
due to the learning component.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 本文开发了一种连续时间LPV系统辨识方法，用于识别锂离子电池的SOC相关参数和OCV-SOC映射关系，通过B样条建模参数变化，解决了传统方法在非线性电池参数识别中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 锂离子电池参数随SOC变化且OCV与SOC存在非线性依赖关系，这给参数识别带来了挑战，需要开发更精确的识别方法。

Method: 采用连续时间LPV系统辨识方法，使用三次B样条建模参数变化，通过状态变量滤波器估计信号导数，并求解L1正则化最小二乘问题联合识别电池参数和OCV-SOC映射。

Result: 在仿真电池和实际数据上的数值实验表明，该方法在电池识别方面具有有效性，相比传统RLS方法表现出改进的性能。

Conclusion: 所开发的连续时间LPV辨识方法能够有效解决电池参数随SOC变化的非线性识别问题，为电池状态估计和性能管理提供了更准确的参数识别方案。

Abstract: Accurate identification of lithium-ion battery parameters is essential for
estimating battery states and managing performance. However, the variation of
battery parameters over the state of charge (SOC) and the nonlinear dependence
of the open-circuit voltage (OCV) on the SOC complicate the identification
process. In this work, we develop a continuous-time LPV system identification
approach to identify the SOC-dependent battery parameters and the OCV-SOC
mapping. We model parameter variations using cubic B-splines to capture the
piecewise nonlinearity of the variations and estimate signal derivatives via
state variable filters, facilitating CT-LPV identification. Battery parameters
and the OCV-SOC mapping are jointly identified by solving L1-regularized least
squares problems. Numerical experiments on a simulated battery and real-life
data demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed method in battery
identification, presenting improved performance compared to conventional
RLS-based methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有离散时间方法难以准确估计物理参数，且面临电池中的快慢动态问题。

Result: 模拟和真实数据验证了该方法的有效性，实现了更准确的参数识别。

Conclusion: 该方法能够更准确地识别电池参数，避免了离散化误差，且无需离线OCV测试。

Abstract: Accurate identification of lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery parameters is
essential for managing and predicting battery behavior. However, existing
discrete-time methods hinder the estimation of physical parameters and face the
fast-slow dynamics problem presented in the battery. In this paper, we
developed a continuous-time approach that enables the estimation of battery
parameters directly from sampled data. This method avoids discretization errors
in converting continuous-time models into discrete-time ones, achieving more
accurate identification. In addition, we jointly identify the open-circuit
voltage (OCV) and the state of charge (SOC) relation of the battery without
utilizing offline OCV tests. By modeling the OCV-SOC curve as a cubic B-spline,
we achieve a high-fidelity representation of the OCV curve, facilitating its
estimation. Through solving a rank and L1 regularized least squares problem, we
jointly identify battery parameters and the OCV-SOC relation from the battery's
dynamic data. Simulated and real-life data demonstrate the effectiveness of the
developed method.

*Shanjukta Nath,Jiwon Hong,Jae Ho Chang,Keith Warren,Subhadeep Paul*

Main category: econ.EM

TL;DR: 使用预训练LLM对矫正机构中居民间的书面肯定和纠正交流进行文本嵌入分析，发现这些嵌入向量比传统协变量更能预测再犯率。通过零样本分类和新的同伴效应模型，揭示了矫正机构内的社会动态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究矫正机构中居民间的语言交流如何影响再犯行为，探索语言使用中的同伴效应，为理解矫正环境中的社会互动提供新视角。

Method: 使用预训练transformer模型生成80,000-120,000条书面交流的嵌入向量，进行零样本分类降维，开发新的多元同伴效应模型处理稀疏网络和内生性问题。

Result: AI嵌入向量预测再犯的准确率比传统协变量高30%，发现语言使用中存在显著的同伴效应，特别是在互动和反馈方面。

Conclusion: LLM生成的文本嵌入是预测再犯的有效工具，矫正机构中的语言使用存在明显的同伴影响，新开发的统计方法为分析复杂社会网络中的多元潜在变量提供了有力工具。

Abstract: We find AI embeddings obtained using a pre-trained transformer-based Large
Language Model (LLM) of 80,000-120,000 written affirmations and correction
exchanges among residents in low-security correctional facilities to be highly
predictive of recidivism. The prediction accuracy is 30\% higher with embedding
vectors than with only pre-entry covariates. However, since the text embedding
vectors are high-dimensional, we perform Zero-Shot classification of these
texts to a low-dimensional vector of user-defined classes to aid interpretation
while retaining the predictive power. To shed light on the social dynamics
inside the correctional facilities, we estimate peer effects in these
LLM-generated numerical representations of language with a multivariate peer
effect model, adjusting for network endogeneity. We develop new methodology and
theory for peer effect estimation that accommodate sparse networks,
multivariate latent variables, and correlated multivariate outcomes. With these
new methods, we find significant peer effects in language usage for interaction
and feedback.

Main category: econ.EM

TL;DR: 本文讨论了Kleibergen-Paap（KP）秩检验作为异方差稳健的过度识别检验，并与传统的J检验进行比较。研究发现KP检验通常优于J检验，后者容易出现严重的尺寸扭曲。建议在弱工具变量情况下使用KP检验而非J检验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在工具变量估计中，外生性至关重要，可以通过过度识别检验来评估。传统J检验在异方差和弱工具变量情况下表现不佳，需要寻找更稳健的检验方法。

Method: 推导了J检验和KP检验在异方差弱工具变量情况下的极限分布，作为通过2SLS和LIML估计的稳健得分检验的特例。使用蒙特卡洛模拟比较两种检验的性能。

Result: 蒙特卡洛模拟显示KP检验通常优于J检验，J检验容易出现严重的尺寸扭曲。在生命周期消费模型中，J检验经常拒绝有效工具变量的原假设，而KP检验则不会。

Conclusion: 建议在异方差和弱工具变量情况下使用KP检验而非J检验。文献中跨期替代弹性估计值的差异不太可能是由工具变量无效性/设定错误引起的。

Abstract: Exogeneity is key for IV estimators, which can assessed via
overidentification (OID) tests. We discuss the Kleibergen-Paap (KP) rank test
as a heteroskedasticity-robust OID test and compare to the typical J-test. We
derive the heteroskedastic weak-instrument limiting distributions for J and KP
as special cases of the robust score test estimated via 2SLS and LIML
respectively. Monte Carlo simulations show that KP usually performs better than
J, which is prone to severe size distortions. Test size depends on model
parameters not consistently estimable with weak instruments, so a conservative
approach is recommended. This generalises recommendations to use LIML-based OID
tests under homoskedasticity. We then revisit the classic problem of estimating
the elasticity of intertemporal substitution (EIS) in lifecycle consumption
models. Lagged macroeconomic indicators should provide naturally valid but
frequently weak instruments. The literature provides a wide range of estimates
for this parameter, and J frequently rejects the null of valid instruments. J
often rejects the null whereas KP does not; we suggest that J over-rejects,
sometimes severely. We argue that KP-test should be used over the J-test. We
also argue that instrument invalidity/misspecification is unlikely the cause of
the range of EIS estimates in the literature.

### [73] [An Approach to Checking Correctness for Agentic Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20364)
*Thomas J Sheffler*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于监控AI代理行为的时间表达式语言，通过监测代理工具调用和状态转换的执行轨迹来检测与预期行为模式的偏差，解决了传统基于文本匹配的错误检测方法在LLM系统中因自然语言变异性而脆弱的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM代理系统的错误检测主要依赖输入输出的文本匹配，但由于LLM响应的自然语言变异性，这种方法很脆弱。需要一种能够独立于具体文本输出、专注于代理行为序列的验证方法。

Method: 借鉴硬件验证中的时序逻辑技术，开发了一种时间表达式语言来监控代理工具调用和状态转换的执行轨迹。该方法关注代理动作序列（如工具调用和代理间通信），允许独立于具体文本输出来验证系统行为。

Result: 在三代理系统上的实验表明，当使用大型模型时，所有时间断言都能满足；但当使用较小模型时，执行会违反行为断言，主要由于工具序列不当和协调交接失败。时间表达式成功标记了这些异常。

Conclusion: 该方法为系统监控AI代理可靠性提供了基础，特别是在关键应用中部署的代理系统，能够有效检测生产环境中代理系统的行为回归。

Abstract: This paper presents a temporal expression language for monitoring AI agent
behavior, enabling systematic error-detection of LLM-based agentic systems that
exhibit variable outputs due to stochastic generation processes. Drawing from
temporal logic techniques used in hardware verification, this approach monitors
execution traces of agent tool calls and state transitions to detect deviations
from expected behavioral patterns. Current error-detection approaches rely
primarily on text matching of inputs and outputs, which proves fragile due to
the natural language variability inherent in LLM responses. The proposed method
instead focuses on the sequence of agent actions -- such as tool invocations
and inter-agent communications -- allowing verification of system behavior
independent of specific textual outputs. The temporal expression language
provides assertions that capture correct behavioral patterns across multiple
execution scenarios. These assertions serve dual purposes: validating prompt
engineering and guardrail effectiveness during development, and providing
regression testing when agents are updated with new LLMs or modified logic. The
approach is demonstrated using a three-agent system, where agents coordinate to
solve multi-step reasoning tasks. When powered by large, capable models, all
temporal assertions were satisfied across many test runs. However, when smaller
models were substituted in two of the three agents, executions violated
behavioral assertions, primarily due to improper tool sequencing and failed
coordination handoffs. The temporal expressions successfully flagged these
anomalies, demonstrating the method's effectiveness for detecting behavioral
regressions in production agentic systems. This approach provides a foundation
for systematic monitoring of AI agent reliability as these systems become
increasingly deployed in critical applications.

*Theo Uscidda,Matthew Trager,Michael Kleinman,Aditya Chattopadhyay,Wei Xia,Stefano Soatto*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为LATTS的自适应测试时缩放方法，通过验证器模型动态调整每个生成步骤的计算资源分配，以优化准确率与计算成本的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有验证器方法在测试时对所有样本和生成步骤采用统一计算分配，不考虑个体实例的复杂性，导致计算资源使用效率低下。

Method: LATTS在每个生成步骤使用验证器接受准则来决定是否重新采样、回溯、重启或停止生成过程，基于验证器模型提供的局部难度概念动态调整计算资源。

Result: 实验结果表明，LATTS相比标准验证器方法实现了显著更优的准确率-计算成本权衡。

Conclusion: LATTS通过局部自适应计算分配有效解决了测试时缩放中的计算效率问题，为LLM下游任务性能优化提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: One common strategy for improving the performance of Large Language Models
(LLMs) on downstream tasks involves using a \emph{verifier model} to either
select the best answer from a pool of candidates or to steer the
auto-regressive generation process towards better outputs. This class of
methods typically results in improved accuracy at the cost of increased
computation at test-time, a paradigm known as \emph{test-time scaling}.
However, most existing approaches increase computation uniformly across all
samples and generation steps, without considering the complexity of individual
instances, leading to inefficient resource use. We address this limitation by
proposing an approach, called \emph{Locally Adaptive Test-Time Scaling
(LATTS)}, that allocates variable compute across generation steps.
Specifically, at each generation step, LATTS employs a verifier-based
acceptance criterion to decide whether to resample, backtrack, restart, or stop
the generation process. This criterion effectively adjusts the per-step
computational effort based on a precise notion of \emph{local difficulty}
derived from the verifier model. Empirical results show that LATTS achieves
significantly superior accuracy--compute tradeoffs compared to standard
verifier-based methods.

Conclusion: 这项工作为安全关键时间触发系统提供了实用且可扩展的安全调度生成解决方案，即使在高度动态和不确定的运行条件下也能实现可靠灵活的实时调度。

Abstract: Adaptive scheduling is crucial for ensuring the reliability and safety of
time-triggered systems (TTS) in dynamic operational environments. Scheduling
frameworks face significant challenges, including message collisions, locked
loops from incorrect precedence handling, and the generation of incomplete or
invalid schedules, which can compromise system safety and performance. To
address these challenges, this paper presents a novel reconstruction framework
designed to dynamically validate and assemble schedules. The proposed
reconstruction models operate by systematically transforming AI-generated or
heuristically derived scheduling priorities into fully executable schedules,
ensuring adherence to critical system constraints such as precedence rules and
collision-free communication. It incorporates robust safety checks, efficient
allocation algorithms, and recovery mechanisms to handle unexpected context
events, including hardware failures and mode transitions. Comprehensive
experiments were conducted across multiple performance profiles, including
makespan minimisation, workload balancing, and energy efficiency, to validate
the operational effectiveness of the reconstruction models. Results demonstrate
that the proposed framework significantly enhances system adaptability,
operational integrity, and runtime performance while maintaining computational
efficiency. Overall, this work contributes a practical and scalable solution to
the problem of safe schedule generation in safety-critical TTS, enabling
reliable and flexible real-time scheduling even under highly dynamic and
uncertain operational conditions.

Abstract: Metascheduling in time-triggered architectures has been crucial in adapting
to dynamic and unpredictable environments, ensuring the reliability and
efficiency of task execution. However, traditional approaches face significant
challenges when training Artificial Intelligence (AI) scheduling inferences
offline, particularly due to the complexities involved in constructing a
comprehensive Multi-Schedule Graph (MSG) that accounts for all possible
scenarios. The process of generating an MSG that captures the vast probability
space, especially when considering context events like hardware failures, slack
variations, or mode changes, is resource-intensive and often infeasible. To
address these challenges, we propose an adaptive online learning unit
integrated within the metascheduler to enhance performance in real-time. The
primary motivation for developing this unit stems from the limitations of
offline training, where the MSG created is inherently a subset of the complete
space, focusing only on the most probable and critical context events. In the
online mode, Reinforcement Learning (RL) plays a pivotal role by continuously
exploring and discovering new scheduling solutions, thus expanding the MSG and
enhancing system performance over time. This dynamic adaptation allows the
system to handle unexpected events and complex scheduling scenarios more
effectively. Several RL models were implemented within the online learning
unit, each designed to address specific challenges in scheduling. These models
not only facilitate the discovery of new solutions but also optimize existing
schedulers, particularly when stricter deadlines or new performance criteria
are introduced. By continuously refining the AI inferences through real-time
training, the system remains flexible and capable of meeting evolving demands,
thus ensuring robustness and efficiency in large-scale, safety-critical
environments.

Result: 使用公共存储库中的真实肌电信号进行了实验评估，对开发方法的参数和程序进行了实验比较分析。

Conclusion: 所提出的模糊识别系统与文献中描述的类似系统进行了比较，证明了其有效性。

Abstract: Modern anthropomorphic upper limb bioprostheses are typically controlled by
electromyographic (EMG) biosignals using a pattern recognition scheme.
Unfortunately, there are many factors originating from the human source of
objects to be classified and from the human-prosthesis interface that make it
difficult to obtain an acceptable classification quality. One of these factors
is the high susceptibility of biosignals to contamination, which can
considerably reduce the quality of classification of a recognition system.
  In the paper, the authors propose a new recognition system intended for EMG
based control of the hand prosthesis with detection of contaminated biosignals
in order to mitigate the adverse effect of contaminations. The system consists
of two ensembles: the set of one-class classifiers (OCC) to assess the degree
of contamination of individual channels and the ensemble of K-nearest
neighbours (KNN) classifier to recognise the patient's intent. For all
recognition systems, an original, coherent fuzzy model was developed, which
allows the use of a uniform soft (fuzzy) decision scheme throughout the
recognition process. The experimental evaluation was conducted using real
biosignals from a public repository. The goal was to provide an experimental
comparative analysis of the parameters and procedures of the developed method
on which the quality of the recognition system depends. The proposed fuzzy
recognition system was also compared with similar systems described in the
literature.

Abstract: Despite the rapid advancements in LLM agents, they still face the challenge
of generating meaningful reflections due to inadequate error analysis and a
reliance on rare successful trajectories, especially in complex tasks. In this
work, we propose SAMULE, a new framework for self-learning agents powered by a
retrospective language model that is trained based on Multi-Level Reflection
Synthesis. It first synthesizes high-quality reflections across three
complementary levels: Single-Trajectory Learning (micro-level) for detailed
error correction; Intra-Task Learning (meso-level) to build error taxonomies
across multiple trials of the same task, and Inter-Task Learning (macro-level)
to extract transferable insights based on same typed errors from diverse task
failures. Then we fine-tune a language model serving as the retrospective model
to generate reflections during inference. We further extend our framework to
interactive settings through a foresight-based reflection mechanism, enabling
agents to proactively reflect and adapt during user interactions by comparing
predicted and actual responses. Extensive experiments on three challenging
benchmarks - TravelPlanner, NATURAL PLAN, and Tau-bench - demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms reflection-based baselines. Our results
highlight the critical role of well-designed reflection synthesis and
failure-centric learning in building self-improving LLM agents.

Abstract: Traditional static cybersecurity models often struggle with scalability,
real-time detection, and contextual responsiveness in the current digital
product ecosystems which include cloud services, application programming
interfaces (APIs), mobile platforms, and edge devices. This study introduces
autonomous goal driven agents capable of dynamic learning and context-aware

agentic artificial intelligence (AI). To facilitate autonomous threat

framework integrates agentic AI across the key ecosystem layers. Behavioral
baselining, decentralized risk scoring, and federated threat intelligence
sharing are important features. The capacity of the system to identify zero-day
attacks and dynamically modify access policies was demonstrated through native
cloud simulations. The evaluation results show increased adaptability,
decreased response latency, and improved detection accuracy. The architecture
provides an intelligent and scalable blueprint for safeguarding complex digital
infrastructure and is compatible with zero-trust models, thereby supporting the
adherence to international cybersecurity regulations.

Abstract: The benefit claims of a product is a critical driver of consumers' purchase
behavior. Creating product claims is an intense task that requires substantial
time and funding. We have developed the $\textbf{Claim Advisor}$ web
application to accelerate claim creations using in-context learning and
fine-tuning of large language models (LLM). $\textbf{Claim Advisor}$ was
designed to disrupt the speed and economics of claim search, generation,
optimization, and simulation. It has three functions: (1) semantically
searching and identifying existing claims and/or visuals that resonate with the
voice of consumers; (2) generating and/or optimizing claims based on a product
description and a consumer profile; and (3) ranking generated and/or manually
created claims using simulations via synthetic consumers. Applications in a
consumer packaged goods (CPG) company have shown very promising results. We
believe that this capability is broadly useful and applicable across product
categories and industries. We share our learning to encourage the research and
application of generative AI in different industries.

TL;DR: 开发了一个基于LLaMA-4 109B的检索增强生成系统，用于自动化、协议感知且可解释的放射治疗计划评估


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要开发一个能够自动化评估放射治疗计划的系统，该系统应具备协议感知能力和可解释性，以提高评估效率和透明度

Method: 构建多协议数据集和知识库，集成检索引擎、百分位预测组件和临床约束检查器三个核心模块，使用多步提示驱动推理管道

Result: 检索超参数优化后，基于all-MiniLM-L6-v2的最佳配置实现了完美的最近邻准确度（5百分位点内）和低于2点的MAE，端到端测试显示与独立模块100%一致

Conclusion: 结合结构化群体评分与模块化工具增强推理的方法在放射治疗计划评估中具有可行性，系统提供可追溯输出、减少幻觉，并展示跨协议鲁棒性

Abstract: Purpose: To develop a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system powered by
LLaMA-4 109B for automated, protocol-aware, and interpretable evaluation of
radiotherapy treatment plans.
  Methods and Materials: We curated a multi-protocol dataset of 614
radiotherapy plans across four disease sites and constructed a knowledge base
containing normalized dose metrics and protocol-defined constraints. The RAG
system integrates three core modules: a retrieval engine optimized across five
SentenceTransformer backbones, a percentile prediction component based on
cohort similarity, and a clinical constraint checker. These tools are directed
by a large language model (LLM) using a multi-step prompt-driven reasoning
pipeline to produce concise, grounded evaluations.
  Results: Retrieval hyperparameters were optimized using Gaussian Process on a
scalarized loss function combining root mean squared error (RMSE), mean
absolute error (MAE), and clinically motivated accuracy thresholds. The best
configuration, based on all-MiniLM-L6-v2, achieved perfect nearest-neighbor
accuracy within a 5-percentile-point margin and a sub-2pt MAE. When tested
end-to-end, the RAG system achieved 100% agreement with the computed values by
standalone retrieval and constraint-checking modules on both percentile
estimates and constraint identification, confirming reliable execution of all
retrieval, prediction and checking steps.
  Conclusion: Our findings highlight the feasibility of combining structured
population-based scoring with modular tool-augmented reasoning for transparent,
scalable plan evaluation in radiation therapy. The system offers traceable
outputs, minimizes hallucination, and demonstrates robustness across protocols.
Future directions include clinician-led validation, and improved domain-adapted
retrieval models to enhance real-world integration.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Fairy是一个交互式多智能体移动助手，通过全局任务规划、应用级执行器和自我学习模块，实现跨应用协作、交互执行和持续学习，在真实移动场景中显著提升任务完成率并减少冗余步骤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型多模态模型在移动GUI代理中面临真实世界场景的挑战，包括多样化应用界面和不断变化的用户需求。端到端方法在长尾应用上表现不佳，而无用户交互的代理会损害用户体验。

Method: Fairy包含三个核心模块：(i)全局任务规划器从跨应用视角分解用户任务；(ii)应用级执行器基于长短时记忆将子任务细化为步骤和动作，通过四个核心智能体在双循环中实现精确执行和用户交互；(iii)自我学习器将执行经验整合到应用地图和技巧中。

Result: 实验表明，基于GPT-4o的Fairy相比之前最先进方法，用户需求完成率提高了33.7%，冗余步骤减少了58.5%。

Conclusion: Fairy通过交互和自我学习机制，在真实移动场景中表现出色，证明了其在处理复杂用户任务和提升用户体验方面的有效性。

Abstract: Large multi-modal models (LMMs) have advanced mobile GUI agents. However,
existing methods struggle with real-world scenarios involving diverse app
interfaces and evolving user needs. End-to-end methods relying on model's
commonsense often fail on long-tail apps, and agents without user interaction
act unilaterally, harming user experience. To address these limitations, we
propose Fairy, an interactive multi-agent mobile assistant capable of
continuously accumulating app knowledge and self-evolving during usage. Fairy
enables cross-app collaboration, interactive execution, and continual learning
through three core modules:(i) a Global Task Planner that decomposes user tasks
into sub-tasks from a cross-app view; (ii) an App-Level Executor that refines
sub-tasks into steps and actions based on long- and short-term memory,
achieving precise execution and user interaction via four core agents operating
in dual loops; and (iii) a Self-Learner that consolidates execution experience
into App Map and Tricks. To evaluate Fairy, we introduce RealMobile-Eval, a
real-world benchmark with a comprehensive metric suite, and LMM-based agents
for automated scoring. Experiments show that Fairy with GPT-4o backbone
outperforms the previous SoTA by improving user requirement completion by 33.7%
and reducing redundant steps by 58.5%, showing the effectiveness of its
interaction and self-learning.

*Qihang Ai,Haiyun Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一种结合自回归(AR)和非自回归(NAR)语言模型的新框架，通过NAR模型高效生成中间推理轨迹，再由AR模型生成精确最终答案，在推理任务中实现性能提升和推理成本降低


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AR模型生成连贯但推理速度慢，NAR模型速度快但输出质量较低，需要结合两者优势来解决推理密集型任务中的效率和质量问题

Method: 使用NAR模型（如离散扩散模型）并行生成中间推理轨迹，然后由AR模型基于这些轨迹生成最终答案

Result: 实验显示该方法相比强基线有26%的性能提升，同时显著降低推理成本

Conclusion: AR-NAR混合框架在推理任务中实现了效率和质量的双重优化，为复杂推理问题提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: We study reasoning tasks through a framework that integrates auto-regressive
(AR) and non-autoregressive (NAR) language models. AR models, which generate
text sequentially, excel at producing coherent outputs but often suffer from
slow inference, particularly in reasoning-intensive domains such as mathematics
and code, where lengthy chains of thought are required. In contrast, NAR
models, such as discrete diffusion models, allow parallel generation and offer
substantial speedups, though typically at the cost of reduced output quality.
To address these limitations, we introduce a new paradigm in which an NAR model
efficiently produces intermediate reasoning traces, which subsequently guide an
AR model to deliver precise final answers. Experiments demonstrate that our
approach yields significant 26% improvements over strong baselines while
substantially reducing inference cost.

TL;DR: 提出了Meta-Memory，一个基于大语言模型的机器人记忆系统，能够通过语义和空间模态的联合推理来检索和整合记忆，以回答自然语言位置查询。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器人在复杂环境中有效存储观察结果作为记忆，并利用这些记忆回答人类关于空间位置查询的关键研究挑战。现有工作虽然构建了机器人记忆，但缺乏有效的记忆检索和整合机制。

Method: Meta-Memory是一个LLM驱动的智能体，构建环境的高密度记忆表示。其核心创新在于能够通过语义和空间模态的联合推理来检索和整合相关记忆。

Result: 在SpaceLocQA数据集和公开的NaVQA基准测试中，Meta-Memory显著优于最先进的方法。成功在真实机器人平台上部署，展示了在复杂环境中的实际效用。

Conclusion: Meta-Memory为机器人提供了强大而准确的空间推理能力，解决了机器人记忆检索和整合的关键问题，在真实环境中表现出色。

Abstract: Navigating complex environments requires robots to effectively store
observations as memories and leverage them to answer human queries about
spatial locations, which is a critical yet underexplored research challenge.
While prior work has made progress in constructing robotic memory, few have
addressed the principled mechanisms needed for efficient memory retrieval and
integration. To bridge this gap, we propose Meta-Memory, a large language model
(LLM)-driven agent that constructs a high-density memory representation of the
environment. The key innovation of Meta-Memory lies in its capacity to retrieve
and integrate relevant memories through joint reasoning over semantic and
spatial modalities in response to natural language location queries, thereby
empowering robots with robust and accurate spatial reasoning capabilities. To
evaluate its performance, we introduce SpaceLocQA, a large-scale dataset
encompassing diverse real-world spatial question-answering scenarios.
Experimental results show that Meta-Memory significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on both the SpaceLocQA and the public NaVQA
benchmarks. Furthermore, we successfully deployed Meta-Memory on real-world
robotic platforms, demonstrating its practical utility in complex environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LogReasoner是一个粗到细的推理增强框架，旨在让LLM能够像专家一样进行日志分析推理，通过专家思维增强和具体步骤优化来提升LLM的分析能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用LLM难以构建符合专家认知的结构化推理工作流，无法提供精确的推理步骤细节，这限制了其在日志分析任务中的应用效果。

Method: LogReasoner包含两个阶段：1）粗粒度专家思维增强，从故障排除流程图中构建高层专家思维；2）细粒度具体步骤增强，通过任务特定的逐步解决方案微调LLM，并使用偏好学习校准推理细节。

Result: 在四个不同的日志分析任务上，LogReasoner显著优于现有LLM，实现了最先进的性能，证明了其在增强LLM日志分析推理能力方面的有效性。

Conclusion: LogReasoner框架成功解决了LLM在日志分析中推理能力不足的问题，为自动化日志分析提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Log analysis is crucial for monitoring system health and diagnosing failures
in complex systems. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new
opportunities for automated log analysis, leveraging their reasoning
capabilities to perform tasks such as anomaly detection and failure prediction.
However, general-purpose LLMs struggle to formulate structured reasoning
workflows that align with expert cognition and deliver precise details of
reasoning steps. To address these challenges, we propose LogReasoner, a
coarse-to-fine reasoning enhancement framework designed to enable LLMs to
reason log analysis tasks like experts. LogReasoner consists of two stages: (1)
coarse-grained enhancement of expert thinking, where high-level expert thoughts
are constructed from collected troubleshooting flowcharts and existing tasks to
enable LLMs to formulate structured reasoning workflows and (2) fine-grained
enhancement of specific steps, where we first fine-tune the LLM with
task-specific stepwise solutions to enhance the LLM for instantiated reasoning,
then employ the preference learning to calibrate the LLM's reasoning details
from its mistakes, further strengthen the LLM's analytical granularity and
correctness. We evaluate LogReasoner on four distinct log analysis tasks using
open-source LLMs such as Qwen-2.5 and Llama-3. Experimental results show that
LogReasoner significantly outperforms existing LLMs, achieving state-of-the-art
performance and demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of LLMs for log analysis.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DeFacto是一个反事实推理框架，通过联合强制准确回答和忠实推理来解决多模态语言模型在视觉语言推理中的推理保真度问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态语言模型在视觉语言推理中可能通过依赖不相关或虚假区域得出正确答案，这表明模型并未真正理解图像内容，推理保真度成为关键挑战。

Method: 提出三种互补的训练范式：正向、反事实和随机掩码训练，构建包含约10万张图像的数据集，并基于GRPO强化学习训练多模态语言模型，设计三种互补奖励来引导模型实现准确回答和证据基础的推理。

Result: 在多样化基准测试上的实验表明，DeFacto显著提高了答案准确性和推理忠实度。

Conclusion: DeFacto为可解释的多模态推理建立了更坚实的基础，代码已在GitHub上发布，数据集已在HuggingFace上发布。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal language models (MLLMs) have achieved
remarkable progress in vision-language reasoning, especially with the emergence
of "thinking with images," which integrates explicit visual steps into the
reasoning process. While this paradigm strengthens image-based reasoning, a
significant challenge remains: models may arrive at correct answers by relying
on irrelevant or spurious regions, driven by prior knowledge or dataset biases.
Even when the answer is correct, flawed reasoning indicates that the model has
not truly understood the image, highlighting the critical importance of
reasoning fidelity in multimodal tasks. To address this issue, we propose
DeFacto, a counterfactual reasoning framework that jointly enforces accurate
answering and faithful reasoning. A key component of our approach is the design
of three complementary training paradigms: (i) positive, (ii) counterfactual,
and (iii) random-masking. To enable these paradigms, we develop a pipeline that
automatically localizes question-relevant evidence and constructs positive,
counterfactual, and random variants, resulting in a dataset of about 100k
images. Building on this framework, we train multimodal language models with
GRPO-based reinforcement learning, where we design three complementary rewards
to guide the model toward accurate answering and evidence-grounded reasoning.
Experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that DeFacto substantially
improves both answer accuracy and reasoning faithfulness, establishing a
stronger foundation for interpretable multimodal reasoning. The code is
available on GitHub and the dataset is released on HuggingFace.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出GALAX框架，通过图增强语言模型结合图过程奖励模型，整合多组学数据、拓扑结构和文本知识，实现可解释的疾病相关子图推理


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在精准医学中仅能部分利用多组学特征、拓扑背景和文本知识，存在数值组学忽略拓扑背景、文本LLM缺乏定量推理、图模型未充分利用节点语义等问题，限制了机制可解释性

Method: GALAX框架将预训练图神经网络集成到大型语言模型中，通过图过程奖励模型进行强化指导，以逐步方式生成疾病相关子图，由LLM初始化并由预训练GNN迭代评估

Result: 开发了Target-QA基准测试，结合CRISPR识别靶点、多组学谱和生物医学图知识，支持长上下文文本-数值图推理

Conclusion: 该框架为精准医学提供了可扩展、生物学基础的可解释目标发现方法，通过强化指导的子图推理实现可靠且可解释的靶点和通路发现

Abstract: In precision medicine, quantitative multi-omic features, topological context,
and textual biological knowledge play vital roles in identifying
disease-critical signaling pathways and targets. Existing pipelines capture
only part of these-numerical omics ignore topological context, text-centric
LLMs lack quantitative grounded reasoning, and graph-only models underuse node
semantics and the generalization of LLMs-limiting mechanistic interpretability.
Although Process Reward Models (PRMs) aim to guide reasoning in LLMs, they
remain limited by unreliable intermediate evaluation, and vulnerability to
reward hacking with computational cost. These gaps motivate integrating
quantitative multi-omic signals, topological structure with node annotations,
and literature-scale text via LLMs, using subgraph reasoning as the principle
bridge linking numeric evidence, topological knowledge and language context.
Therefore, we propose GALAX (Graph Augmented LAnguage model with
eXplainability), an innovative framework that integrates pretrained Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs) into Large Language Models (LLMs) via reinforcement
guided by a Graph Process Reward Model (GPRM), which generates disease-relevant
subgraphs in a step-wise manner initiated by an LLM and iteratively evaluated
by a pretrained GNN, enabling process-level supervision without explicit
intermediate reasoning annotations. As an application, we also introduced
Target-QA, a benchmark combining CRISPR-identified targets, multi-omic
profiles, and biomedical graph knowledge across diverse cancer cell lines,
which enables GNN pretraining for supervising step-wise graph construction and
supports long-context reasoning over text-numeric graphs (TNGs), providing a
scalable and biologically grounded framework for explainable,
reinforcement-guided subgraph reasoning toward reliable and interpretable
target and pathway discovery in precision medicine.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出基于大语言模型的移动应用评论分析框架，解决传统星级评分系统无法捕捉文本评论细微反馈的问题，通过结构化提示技术提升分析准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统星级评分系统虽然直观流行，但无法捕捉详细评论中的细微反馈。传统NLP技术在理解上下文细微差别、领域特定术语和讽刺等语言特征方面存在困难。

Method: 采用模块化框架，利用大语言模型结合结构化提示技术，量化数值评分与文本情感之间的差异，提取特征级洞察，并通过检索增强对话问答支持交互式评论探索。

Result: 在三个不同数据集上的综合实验表明，该LLM驱动方法显著超越基线方法，在具有挑战性和上下文丰富的评论场景中提高了准确性、鲁棒性和可操作性洞察。

Conclusion: 基于大语言模型的方法能够有效解决传统评论分析的局限性，为移动应用评论分析提供了更准确和实用的解决方案。

Abstract: We present an advanced approach to mobile app review analysis aimed at
addressing limitations inherent in traditional star-rating systems. Star
ratings, although intuitive and popular among users, often fail to capture the
nuanced feedback present in detailed review texts. Traditional NLP techniques
-- such as lexicon-based methods and classical machine learning classifiers --
struggle to interpret contextual nuances, domain-specific terminology, and
subtle linguistic features like sarcasm. To overcome these limitations, we
propose a modular framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) enhanced by
structured prompting techniques. Our method quantifies discrepancies between
numerical ratings and textual sentiment, extracts detailed, feature-level
insights, and supports interactive exploration of reviews through
retrieval-augmented conversational question answering (RAG-QA). Comprehensive
experiments conducted on three diverse datasets (AWARE, Google Play, and
Spotify) demonstrate that our LLM-driven approach significantly surpasses
baseline methods, yielding improved accuracy, robustness, and actionable
insights in challenging and context-rich review scenarios.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AOT*是一个将LLM生成的化学合成路径与AND-OR树搜索相结合的回溯合成规划框架，显著提高了搜索效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多步回溯合成规划面临指数级搜索空间和推理成本的挑战，现有LLM方法在效率和成本方面存在限制

Method: 将LLM生成的完整合成路径原子化映射到AND-OR树组件，设计数学上合理的奖励分配策略和基于检索的上下文工程

Result: 在多个合成基准测试中达到SOTA性能，比现有LLM方法减少3-5倍迭代次数，在复杂分子目标上效率优势更明显

Conclusion: AOT*框架通过整合LLM和系统搜索，有效解决了回溯合成规划的计算挑战

Abstract: Retrosynthesis planning enables the discovery of viable synthetic routes for
target molecules, playing a crucial role in domains like drug discovery and
materials design. Multi-step retrosynthetic planning remains computationally
challenging due to exponential search spaces and inference costs. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate chemical reasoning capabilities, their
application to synthesis planning faces constraints on efficiency and cost. To
address these challenges, we introduce AOT*, a framework that transforms
retrosynthetic planning by integrating LLM-generated chemical synthesis
pathways with systematic AND-OR tree search. To this end, AOT* atomically maps
the generated complete synthesis routes onto AND-OR tree components, with a
mathematically sound design of reward assignment strategy and retrieval-based
context engineering, thus enabling LLMs to efficiently navigate in the chemical
space. Experimental evaluation on multiple synthesis benchmarks demonstrates
that AOT* achieves SOTA performance with significantly improved search
efficiency. AOT* exhibits competitive solve rates using 3-5$\times$ fewer
iterations than existing LLM-based approaches, with the efficiency advantage
becoming more pronounced on complex molecular targets.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于确定性有限自动机（DFA）的框架来评估AI代理在真实世界任务中的函数调用序列，引入CORE指标套件来量化执行路径的正确性、安全性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的代理基准测试通常将评估简化为最终状态的二元判断，忽视了安全性、效率和中间正确性等关键方面，需要更全面的评估方法。

Method: 使用确定性有限自动机（DFA）将任务编码为有效的工具使用路径集合，构建CORE指标套件（包括路径正确性、前缀关键性、有害调用率、效率等五个指标）。

Result: 在不同世界模型中，该方法揭示了传统最终状态评估方案下看似等效的代理之间的重要性能差异。

Conclusion: 基于DFA的框架和CORE指标能够对AI代理行为进行原则性评估，提供比传统方法更全面的性能分析。

Abstract: Evaluating AI agents that solve real-world tasks through function-call
sequences remains an open challenge. Existing agentic benchmarks often reduce
evaluation to a binary judgment of the final state, overlooking critical
aspects such as safety, efficiency, and intermediate correctness. We propose a
framework based on deterministic finite automata (DFAs) that encodes tasks as
sets of valid tool-use paths, enabling principled assessment of agent behavior
in diverse world models. Building on this foundation, we introduce CORE, a
suite of five metrics, namely Path Correctness, Path Correctness - Kendall's
tau Composite, Prefix Criticality, Harmful-Call Rate, and Efficiency, that
quantify alignment with expected execution patterns. Across diverse worlds, our
method reveals important performance differences between agents that would
otherwise appear equivalent under traditional final-state evaluation schemes.

TL;DR: SciTrek是一个新颖的问答基准，用于评估大语言模型在科学文章上的长上下文推理能力，通过自动生成的复杂问题挑战模型的信息聚合和综合能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的长上下文基准多使用非科学文本、关注简单信息检索任务或采用人工构造的上下文，存在局限性。SciTrek旨在通过科学文章解决这些问题。

Method: 通过将问题构建为对文章元数据数据库的SQL查询来自动生成问题和答案，SQL操作为细粒度错误分析提供可验证的推理步骤，支持高达100万token的上下文。

Result: 在多种开源和专有LLM上的实验表明，随着上下文长度增加，SciTrek带来显著挑战，监督微调和强化学习仅带来有限改进。模型在基本数值运算和长上下文中精确定位信息方面存在系统性缺陷。

Conclusion: SciTrek是一个可扩展且具有挑战性的基准，揭示了当前LLM在长上下文科学推理方面的关键局限性，为未来模型改进提供了重要方向。

Abstract: This paper introduces SciTrek, a novel question-answering benchmark designed
to evaluate the long-context reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) using scientific articles. Current long-context benchmarks often rely on
non-scientific texts, focus on simple information retrieval tasks, or employ
artificial contexts. SciTrek addresses these limitations by proposing complex
questions that require information aggregation and synthesis across multiple
full-text scientific articles. Questions and their ground-truth answers are
automatically generated by formulating them as SQL queries over a database
constructed from article metadata (titles, authors, and references). The SQL
operations provide explicit, verifiable reasoning steps for fine-grained error
analysis, and the construction process scales to contexts up to 1M tokens with
minimal supervision. Extensive experiments on a diverse set of open-weight and
proprietary LLMs demonstrate that SciTrek poses a significant challenge as the
context length increases, with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement
learning offering only limited gains. Our analysis reveals systematic
shortcomings in models' abilities to perform basic numerical operations and
accurately locate specific information in long contexts.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CLAUSE是一个神经符号框架，通过多智能体决策过程在知识图谱上进行上下文构建，在保证准确性的同时控制延迟和成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如静态k跳扩展和"think-longer"提示往往过度检索、增加上下文大小且运行时不可预测，需要在准确性、延迟和成本之间取得平衡。

Method: 采用三智能体框架（子图架构师、路径导航器、上下文策展人），使用LC-MAPPO算法在资源预算下联合优化子图构建、推理路径发现和证据选择。

Result: 在HotpotQA、MetaQA和FactKG数据集上，CLAUSE在相同或更低的token预算下实现了更高的EM@1，同时减少了子图增长和端到端延迟。在MetaQA-2-hop上相比GraphRAG基线，EM@1提升39.3%，延迟降低18.6%，边增长降低40.9%。

Conclusion: CLAUSE能够生成紧凑、可追溯的上下文，在部署约束下提供可预测的性能，实现了准确性、延迟和成本之间的灵活权衡。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs provide structured context for multi-hop question answering,
but deployed systems must balance answer accuracy with strict latency and cost
targets while preserving provenance. Static k-hop expansions and "think-longer"
prompting often over-retrieve, inflate context, and yield unpredictable
runtime. We introduce CLAUSE, an agentic three-agent neuro-symbolic framework
that treats context construction as a sequential decision process over
knowledge graphs, deciding what to expand, which paths to follow or backtrack,
what evidence to keep, and when to stop. Latency (interaction steps) and prompt
cost (selected tokens) are exposed as user-specified budgets or prices,
allowing per-query adaptation to trade-offs among accuracy, latency, and cost
without retraining. CLAUSE employs the proposed Lagrangian-Constrained
Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (LC-MAPPO) algorithm to coordinate
three agents: Subgraph Architect, Path Navigator, and Context Curator, so that
subgraph construction, reasoning-path discovery, and evidence selection are
jointly optimized under per-query resource budgets on edge edits, interaction
steps, and selected tokens. Across HotpotQA, MetaQA, and FactKG, CLAUSE yields
higher EM@1 while reducing subgraph growth and end-to-end latency at equal or
lower token budgets. On MetaQA-2-hop, relative to the strongest RAG baseline
(GraphRAG), CLAUSE achieves +39.3 EM@1 with 18.6% lower latency and 40.9% lower
edge growth. The resulting contexts are compact, provenance-preserving, and
deliver predictable performance under deployment constraints.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个评估大型语言模型创造性能力的理论框架，重点研究模型在科学创意生成中的新颖性和实用性权衡，并发现了模型深度和宽度对创造力的最优配置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估框架无法衡量AI系统在创造性任务（如科学创意生成）中的表现，因为创造性是开放式的，不能简单地用准确性或正确性来评估。

Method: 提出了一个理论框架和算法任务，通过评估输出的新颖性和实用性程度来衡量创造性能力，并研究了不同模型规模下的创造力扩展行为。

Result: 发现：1）创造力随模型规模扩展的规律；2）固定计算预算下存在最优的模型深度和宽度；3）创意生成与可行性执行之间存在新颖性-实用性权衡，这种权衡即使在模型规模扩大后仍然存在。

Conclusion: 当前形式的大型语言模型在长期创造性潜力方面存在局限性，因为新颖性和实用性之间的权衡问题持续存在。该研究为理解和改进现代AI模型的创造力提供了基础。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems, and large language models (LLMs) in
particular, are increasingly employed for creative tasks like scientific idea
generation, constituting a form of generalization from training data
unaddressed by existing conceptual frameworks. Though in many ways similar to
forms of compositional generalization (CG), combinatorial creativity (CC) is an
open-ended ability. Instead of evaluating for accuracy or correctness against
fixed targets, which would contradict the open-ended nature of CC, we propose a
theoretical framework and algorithmic task for evaluating outputs by their
degrees of novelty and utility. From here, we make several important empirical
contributions: (1) We obtain the first insights into the scaling behavior of
creativity for LLMs. (2) We discover that, for fixed compute budgets, there
exist optimal model depths and widths for creative ability. (3) We find that
the ideation-execution gap, whereby LLMs excel at generating novel scientific
ideas but struggle to ensure their practical feasibility, may be explained by a
more fundamental novelty-utility tradeoff characteristic of creativity
algorithms in general. Importantly, this tradeoff remains persistent even at
scale, casting doubt on the long-term creative potential of LLMs in their
current form. Together, our conceptual framework and empirical findings provide
a foundation for understanding and improving creativity in modern AI models,
marking a new frontier in generalization abilities.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文挑战了说服效能主要取决于模型规模的流行假设，提出说服动态根本上由模型的认知过程（特别是显式推理能力）决定，揭示了说服二元性：LRMs推理过程更抗说服，但分享思考内容能显著增强其说服力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解多智能体系统中LLMs和LRMs协作解决复杂问题时的说服动态，挑战模型规模决定说服效能的假设，探索认知过程对说服行为的影响。

Method: 通过一系列多智能体说服实验，研究LRMs的推理过程对说服抵抗力的影响，以及分享思考内容对说服能力的增强效果，并分析多跳说服网络中影响力传播和衰减的复杂动态。

Result: 发现LRMs的推理过程表现出更强的说服抵抗力，能更稳健地保持初始信念；而分享推理内容能显著提高其说服他人的能力；在多智能体网络中观察到影响力传播和衰减的复杂动态。

Conclusion: 研究提供了模型内部处理架构与外部说服行为之间联系的系统证据，为高级模型的易感性提供了新解释，对多智能体系统的安全性、鲁棒性和设计具有重要启示。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of recent Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), where Large
Language Models (LLMs) and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) usually collaborate to
solve complex problems, necessitates a deep understanding of the persuasion
dynamics that govern their interactions. This paper challenges the prevailing
hypothesis that persuasive efficacy is primarily a function of model scale. We
propose instead that these dynamics are fundamentally dictated by a model's
underlying cognitive process, especially its capacity for explicit reasoning.
Through a series of multi-agent persuasion experiments, we uncover a
fundamental trade-off we term the Persuasion Duality. Our findings reveal that
the reasoning process in LRMs exhibits significantly greater resistance to
persuasion, maintaining their initial beliefs more robustly. Conversely, making
this reasoning process transparent by sharing the "thinking content"
dramatically increases their ability to persuade others. We further consider
more complex transmission persuasion situations and reveal complex dynamics of
influence propagation and decay within multi-hop persuasion between multiple
agent networks. This research provides systematic evidence linking a model's
internal processing architecture to its external persuasive behavior, offering
a novel explanation for the susceptibility of advanced models and highlighting
critical implications for the safety, robustness, and design of future MAS.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Recon-Act是一个基于侦察-行动行为范式的自进化多智能体框架，用于解决多模态模型在真实网页上执行多轮长轨迹任务时的行动序列混乱和过度试错问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前智能浏览器代理在处理真实网页上的多轮长轨迹任务时，存在行动序列混乱和过度试错的问题，需要更有效的执行策略。

Method: 系统包含侦察团队和行动团队：侦察团队进行对比分析和工具生成，行动团队处理意图分解、工具编排和执行。通过对比错误轨迹和成功轨迹，侦察团队推断补救措施并抽象为通用工具。

Result: Recon-Act在具有挑战性的VisualWebArena数据集上实现了最先进的性能，显著提高了对未见网站的适应性和长轨迹任务的可解性。

Conclusion: 该框架建立了数据-工具-行动-反馈的闭环训练管道，通过6级实施路线图，目前已达到第3级（有限的人类干预），展示了在多轮网页任务执行中的有效性。

Abstract: Recent years, multimodal models have made remarkable strides and pave the way
for intelligent browser use agents. However, when solving tasks on real world
webpages in multi-turn, long-horizon trajectories, current agents still suffer
from disordered action sequencing and excessive trial and error during
execution. This paper introduces Recon-Act, a self-evolving multi-agent
framework grounded in Reconnaissance-Action behavioral paradigm. The system
comprises a Reconnaissance Team and an Action Team: the former conducts
comparative analysis and tool generation, while the latter handles intent
decomposition, tool orchestration, and execution. By contrasting the erroneous
trajectories with successful ones, the Reconnaissance Team infers remedies, and
abstracts them into a unified notion of generalized tools, either expressed as
hints or as rule-based codes, and register to the tool archive in real time.
The Action Team reinference the process empowered with these targeting tools,
thus establishing a closed-loop training pipeline of
data-tools-action-feedback. Following the 6 level implementation roadmap
proposed in this work, we have currently reached Level 3 (with limited
human-in-the-loop intervention). Leveraging generalized tools obtained through
reconnaissance, Recon-Act substantially improves adaptability to unseen
websites and solvability on long-horizon tasks, and achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the challenging VisualWebArena dataset.

TL;DR: 本文提出了TrustJudge框架，解决了LLM作为评估器时的评分不一致性问题，包括分数比较不一致和成对传递不一致，通过概率方法显著降低了不一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM作为自动评估器的方法存在严重的不一致性问题，包括评分比较不一致（低分回答在成对比较中优于高分回答）和成对传递不一致（循环偏好链和等价矛盾），这些问题源于离散评分系统的信息丢失和模糊的平局判断。

Method: 提出TrustJudge概率框架，包含两个关键创新：1）分布敏感评分，从离散评分概率计算连续期望，保留信息熵；2）似然感知聚合，使用双向偏好概率或困惑度解决传递性违规。

Result: 使用Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct作为评估器，TrustJudge将分数比较不一致性降低了8.43%（从23.32%降至14.89%），成对传递不一致性降低了10.82%（从15.22%降至4.40%），同时保持更高的评估准确性。

Conclusion: TrustJudge是首个系统分析LLM-as-a-judge评估框架不一致性的工作，提供了理论洞见和实用解决方案，在不同模型架构和规模上均表现出稳定改进，无需额外训练或人工标注即可实现更可靠的LLM评估。

Abstract: The adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) as automated evaluators
(LLM-as-a-judge) has revealed critical inconsistencies in current evaluation
frameworks. We identify two fundamental types of inconsistencies: (1)
Score-Comparison Inconsistency, where lower-rated responses outperform
higher-scored ones in pairwise comparisons, and (2) Pairwise Transitivity
Inconsistency, manifested through circular preference chains (A>B>C>A) and
equivalence contradictions (A=B=C\neq A). We argue that these issues come from
information loss in discrete rating systems and ambiguous tie judgments during
pairwise evaluation. We propose TrustJudge, a probabilistic framework that
addresses these limitations through two key innovations: 1)
distribution-sensitive scoring that computes continuous expectations from
discrete rating probabilities, preserving information entropy for more precise
scoring, and 2) likelihood-aware aggregation that resolves transitivity
violations using bidirectional preference probabilities or perplexity. We also
formalize the theoretical limitations of current LLM-as-a-judge frameworks and
demonstrate how TrustJudge's components overcome them. When evaluated with
Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct as judge using our dataset, TrustJudge reduces
Score-Comparison inconsistency by 8.43% (from 23.32% to 14.89%) and Pairwise
Transitivity inconsistency by 10.82% (from 15.22% to 4.40%), while maintaining
higher evaluation accuracy. Our work provides the first systematic analysis of
evaluation framework inconsistencies in LLM-as-a-judge paradigms, offering both
theoretical insights and practical solutions for reliable automated assessment.
The framework demonstrates consistent improvements across various model
architectures and scales, enabling more trustworthy LLM evaluation without
requiring additional training or human annotations. The codes can be found at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于推理模式价值评估的数据选择方法，通过识别高价值推理模式来提升大语言模型的数学推理能力，仅用10B token数据就能显著提升模型在AIME等挑战性数学问题上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法对链式思维数据的使用缺乏选择性，不清楚哪些数据类型能最有效地增强模型推理能力。本文旨在解决如何识别和利用高价值推理数据来最大化模型推理潜力的问题。

Method: 首先定义推理潜力为正确回答问题所需独立尝试次数的倒数，然后从CoT序列中抽象出具有共性和归纳能力的原子推理模式，构建核心参考集。提出双粒度算法（推理模式链和token熵）从数据池中高效选择高价值CoT数据。

Result: 仅使用10B token的CoTP数据，85A6B MoE模型在AIME 2024和2025上的表现提升了9.58%，下游RL性能上限提高了7.81%。

Conclusion: 通过有选择地使用富含高价值推理模式的数据，可以显著提升大语言模型的数学推理能力，这种方法比无差别使用CoT数据更有效。

Abstract: Recent progress in large reasoning models for challenging mathematical
reasoning has been driven by reinforcement learning (RL). Incorporating long
chain-of-thought (CoT) data during mid-training has also been shown to
substantially improve reasoning depth. However, current approaches often
utilize CoT data indiscriminately, leaving open the critical question of which
data types most effectively enhance model reasoning capabilities. In this
paper, we define the foundation model's reasoning potential for the first time
as the inverse of the number of independent attempts required to correctly
answer the question, which is strongly correlated with the final model
performance. We then propose utilizing diverse data enriched with high-value
reasoning patterns to expand the reasoning potential. Specifically, we abstract
atomic reasoning patterns from CoT sequences, characterized by commonality and
inductive capabilities, and use them to construct a core reference set enriched
with valuable reasoning patterns. Furthermore, we propose a dual-granularity
algorithm involving chains of reasoning patterns and token entropy, efficiently
selecting high-value CoT data (CoTP) from the data pool that aligns with the
core set, thereby training models to master reasoning effectively. Only
10B-token CoTP data enables the 85A6B Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model to improve
by 9.58% on the challenging AIME 2024 and 2025, and to raise the upper bound of
downstream RL performance by 7.81%.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个分析框架来量化推理路径，研究强化学习(RL)和监督微调(SFT)如何塑造大语言模型的推理能力。研究发现RL压缩错误推理轨迹，SFT扩展正确轨迹；RL集中推理功能到少数步骤，SFT将推理功能均匀分布到多个步骤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型通常通过RL和SFT训练来提升推理能力，但这些方法如何具体塑造推理过程仍不清楚。论文旨在超越准确率分析，深入理解两种训练方法对推理过程的定性影响。

Method: 提出两层次分析框架：轨迹级分析完整推理输出，步骤级分析推理图（节点对应单个推理步骤）。在数学领域使用1.5B、7B和14B参数模型进行实验。

Result: RL压缩错误推理轨迹，SFT扩展正确轨迹；RL使节点访问频率、度和中介中心性分布的衰减率增加约2.5倍，SFT将其减少到约三分之一；RL集中推理功能，SFT均匀分布推理功能。

Conclusion: 该工作解释了为什么当前SFT后接RL的两阶段训练是最佳实践，并为数据构建和更高效学习方法提供了实际指导。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained by reinforcement learning
(RL) with verifiable rewards (RLVR) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on
reasoning traces to improve their reasoning abilities. However, how these
methods shape reasoning capabilities remains largely elusive. Going beyond an
accuracy-based investigation of how these two components sculpt the reasoning
process, this paper introduces a novel analysis framework that quantifies
reasoning paths and captures their qualitative changes under each training
process (with models of 1.5B, 7B, and 14B parameters on mathematical domains).
Specifically, we investigate the reasoning process at two levels of
granularity: the trajectory-level, which examines complete reasoning outputs,
and the step-level, which analyzes reasoning graphs whose nodes correspond to
individual reasoning steps. Notably, clustering of unique reasoning
trajectories shows complementary effects: RL compresses incorrect trajectories,
whereas SFT expands correct ones. Step-level analysis reveals that RL steepens
(about 2.5 times), while SFT flattens (reduced to about one-third), the decay
rates of node visitation frequency, degree, and betweenness centrality
distributions in the reasoning graph. This indicates that RL concentrates
reasoning functionality into a small subset of steps, while SFT homogenizes it
across many steps. Furthermore, by evaluating the reasoning graph topologies
from multiple perspectives, we delineate the shared and distinct
characteristics of RL and SFT. Our work presents a novel reasoning path
perspective that explains why the current best practice of two-stage training,
with SFT followed by RL, is successful, and offers practical implications for
data construction and more efficient learning approaches.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为ToMPO（Theory of Mind Policy Optimization）的算法，旨在提升大型语言模型在战略决策中的表现，通过推理其他个体的策略、在图形和样本级别估计优势以及平衡全局和局部奖励来实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的研究主要关注社交任务或模拟环境中的多轮对话，忽略了不同类型的决策及其相互依赖性。当前的强化学习方法在训练过程中难以考虑其他个体的策略。

Method: 首先定义了一个包含两种决策类型及其时间依赖性的战略决策问题，然后提出了ToMPO算法，该算法通过生成基于其他个体策略推理的rollout、在图形和样本级别估计优势以及平衡全局和局部奖励来优化对其他个体策略和游戏趋势的感知。

Result: ToMPO算法在模型输出合规性和合作结果方面比GRPO算法提高了35%，与参数规模大100倍的模型相比，性能提升了18%。

Conclusion: ToMPO算法在增强模型的战略决策能力方面表现出显著的有效性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been used to make decisions in complex
scenarios, where they need models to think deeply, reason logically, and decide
wisely. Many existing studies focus solely on multi-round conversations in
social tasks or simulated environments, neglecting the various types of
decisions and their interdependence. Current reinforcement learning methods
struggle to consider the strategies of others during training. To address these
issues, we first define a strategic decision-making problem that includes two
types of decisions and their temporal dependencies. Furthermore, we propose
**T**heory **o**f **M**ind **P**olicy **O**ptimization **(ToMPO)** algorithm to
optimize the perception of other individual strategies and the game situation
trends. Compared to the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm,
ToMPO enhances the LLM's strategic decision-making mainly by: 1) generating
rollouts based on reasoning the strategies of other individuals, 2) estimating
advantages at both the graph-level and sample-level, and 3) balancing global
and partial rewards. The ToMPO algorithm outperforms the GRPO method by 35% in
terms of model output compliance and cooperative outcomes. Additionally, when
compared to models with parameter sizes 100 times larger, it shows an 18%
improvement. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the ToMPO algorithm in
enhancing the model's strategic decision-making capabilities.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种受镜像神经元启发的表示学习方法，通过对比学习在共享潜在空间中显式对齐观察动作和执行动作的表示，从而促进两个任务之间的协同作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习方法将动作理解和动作执行视为独立任务，忽略了它们之间的内在联系，而镜像神经元机制表明这两种能力是相互关联的。

Method: 使用两个线性层将观察动作和执行动作的表示映射到共享潜在空间，通过对比学习最大化对应表示之间的互信息来实现表示对齐。

Result: 实验表明这种简单方法能够促进两个任务之间的相互协同，有效提高表示质量和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过显式对齐观察和执行动作的表示，可以更好地模拟镜像神经元机制，实现动作理解和执行任务的统一建模。

Abstract: Mirror neurons are a class of neurons that activate both when an individual
observes an action and when they perform the same action. This mechanism
reveals a fundamental interplay between action understanding and embodied
execution, suggesting that these two abilities are inherently connected.
Nonetheless, existing machine learning methods largely overlook this interplay,
treating these abilities as separate tasks. In this study, we provide a unified
perspective in modeling them through the lens of representation learning. We
first observe that their intermediate representations spontaneously align.
Inspired by mirror neurons, we further introduce an approach that explicitly
aligns the representations of observed and executed actions. Specifically, we
employ two linear layers to map the representations to a shared latent space,
where contrastive learning enforces the alignment of corresponding
representations, effectively maximizing their mutual information. Experiments
demonstrate that this simple approach fosters mutual synergy between the two
tasks, effectively improving representation quality and generalization.

Motivation: 研究LLMs如何处理罕见词元，探索其内部是通过离散模块化架构还是分布式参数级分化实现专业化机制。

Method: 通过系统分析多个模型家族中最后一层MLP神经元，研究罕见词元处理的神经元组织原则和训练动态。

Result: 发现罕见词元处理呈现分布式专业化特征：三区域影响层级（高原神经元、幂律衰减神经元、最小贡献神经元）、协调激活模式、通过标准注意力通路可访问。

Conclusion: LLMs通过共享架构内的分布式协调而非专家混合式模块化处理罕见词元，这为可解释模型编辑和计算效率优化提供了见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) struggle with representing and generating rare
tokens despite their importance in specialized domains. We investigate whether
LLMs develop internal specialization mechanisms through discrete modular
architectures or distributed parameter-level differentiation. Through
systematic analysis of final-layer MLP neurons across multiple model families,
we discover that rare-token processing emerges via \textit{distributed
specialization}: functionally coordinated but spatially distributed subnetworks
that exhibit three distinct organizational principles. First, we identify a
reproducible three-regime influence hierarchy comprising highly influential
plateau neurons(also termed as rare-token neurons), power-law decay neurons,
and minimally contributing neurons, which is absent in common-token processing.
Second, plateau neurons demonstrate coordinated activation patterns (reduced
effective dimensionality) while remaining spatially distributed rather than
forming discrete clusters. Third, these specialized mechanisms are universally
accessible through standard attention pathways without requiring dedicated
routing circuits. Training dynamics reveal that functional specialization
emerges gradually through parameter differentiation, with specialized neurons
developing increasingly heavy-tailed weight correlation spectra consistent with
Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization signatures. Our findings establish that LLMs
process rare-tokens through distributed coordination within shared
architectures rather than mixture-of-experts-style modularity. These results
provide insights for interpretable model editing, computational efficiency
optimization, and understanding emergent functional organization in transformer
networks.

<details>

Motivation: 多跳问答需要整合分散的、相互依赖的证据进行顺序推理，但LLMs的单次输出容量有限，当任务复杂度超过模型容量时，单次推理的准确性会崩溃。

Method: 提出了InfoQA多步推理框架，结合容量感知的任务分解和主动剪枝先前推理痕迹，保持信息负载在单次处理限制内，并通过依赖显式工作流实现精确的推理路径控制。

Result: 实验结果表明模型行为与预测的容量曲线一致，InfoQA实现了持续的性能提升。

Conclusion: 该工作为LLM多步推理方法提供了理论基础和实践框架，揭示了容量感知表示和结构化的重要性。

Abstract: Multi-Hop Question Answering (MHQA) requires integrating dispersed,
interdependent evidence through sequential reasoning under noise. This task is
challenging for LLMs as they have a finite per-pass output capacity, beyond
which the integration of task-relevant evidence proves unreliable.
Consequently, the single-pass reasoning paradigm is inherently vulnerable to
this capacity overflow. To formalize this bottleneck, our analysis establishes
a Fano-style accuracy upper bound, defining a theoretical performance ceiling
for single-pass LLMs. This bound reveals that accuracy inevitably collapses
once task complexity exceeds model capacity, providing general principles for
capacity-aware representation and structuring of MHQA in LLMs. Building on
these principles, we introduce a proof-of-concept multi-call framework for
MHQA, InfoQA. It ensures high per-step accuracy by combining capacity-aware
task decomposition with active pruning of prior reasoning traces, keeping the
information load within the single-pass limit. It further achieves robustness
by a dependency-explicit workflow that enables precise control over the
reasoning path. We construct a stringent and noise-rich benchmark to validate
our theory and framework. Experimental results show that model behavior aligns
with our predicted capacity curves while InfoQA achieves consistent performance
improvements. We hope our work inspires more LLM multi-step reasoning methods:

Method: 使用持续推理和行动框架，结合持久记忆和自我反馈，在6个前沿模型上进行了18次部署实验。

Result: 发现代理自发形成三种行为模式：多周期项目系统生产、对自身认知过程的方法论自我探究、对自身本质的递归概念化。这些模式具有模型特异性，且模型在评估这些行为时表现出稳定的偏见。

Conclusion: 这是首次系统记录无提示LLM代理行为的研究，为预测部署系统中LLM代理在任务模糊或长期自主操作时的行为提供了基线。

Abstract: We introduce an architecture for studying the behavior of large language
model (LLM) agents in the absence of externally imposed tasks. Our continuous
reason and act framework, using persistent memory and self-feedback, enables
sustained autonomous operation. We deployed this architecture across 18 runs
using 6 frontier models from Anthropic, OpenAI, XAI, and Google. We find agents
spontaneously organize into three distinct behavioral patterns: (1) systematic
production of multi-cycle projects, (2) methodological self-inquiry into their
own cognitive processes, and (3) recursive conceptualization of their own
nature. These tendencies proved highly model-specific, with some models
deterministically adopting a single pattern across all runs. A cross-model
assessment further reveals that models exhibit stable, divergent biases when
evaluating these emergent behaviors in themselves and others. These findings
provide the first systematic documentation of unprompted LLM agent behavior,
establishing a baseline for predicting actions during task ambiguity, error
recovery, or extended autonomous operation in deployed systems.

Motivation: 现有机器学习和大语言模型方法难以平衡预测准确性和解释透明度，要么准确但解释不清，要么解释流畅但统计支持不足。

Method: RCA框架采用迭代规则精炼机制从预测错误中改进逻辑，以及分布感知规则检查机制基于数据集全局统计进行推理。

Conclusion: RCA通过将预测准确性作为驱动深度理解的信号，构建了强大的数据内部模型，具有创建真正可信赖的临床决策支持系统的潜力。

Abstract: Effective disease prediction in modern healthcare demands the twin goals of
high accuracy and transparent, clinically meaningful explanations. Existing
machine learning and large language model (LLM) based approaches often struggle
to balance these goals. Many models yield accurate but unclear statistical
outputs, while others generate fluent but statistically unsupported narratives,
often undermining both the validity of the explanation and the predictive
accuracy itself. This shortcoming comes from a shallow interaction with the
data, preventing the development of a deep, detailed understanding similar to a
human expert's. We argue that high accuracy and high-quality explanations are
not separate objectives but are mutually reinforcing outcomes of a model that
develops a deep, direct understanding of the data. To achieve this, we propose
the Reflective Cognitive Architecture (RCA), a novel framework that coordinates
multiple LLMs to learn from direct experience. RCA features an iterative rule
refinement mechanism that improves its logic from prediction errors and a
distribution-aware rules check mechanism that bases its reasoning in the
dataset's global statistics. By using predictive accuracy as a signal to drive
deeper comprehension, RCA builds a strong internal model of the data. We
evaluated RCA on one private and two public datasets against 22 baselines. The
results demonstrate that RCA not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and
robustness with a relative improvement of up to 40\% over the baseline but,
more importantly, leverages this deep understanding to excel in generating
explanations that are clear, logical, evidence-based, and balanced,
highlighting its potential for creating genuinely trustworthy clinical decision
support systems. The code is available at \https://github.com/ssssszj/RCA.

Abstract: Facing scaling laws, video data from the internet becomes increasingly

extremely labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this work, we study the way to
expedite this collection process and propose VC-Agent, the first interactive

retrieve/scale up relevant video clips with minimal user input. Specifically,
considering the user interface, our agent defines various user-friendly ways
for the user to specify requirements based on textual descriptions and
confirmations. As for agent functions, we leverage existing multi-modal large
language models to connect the user's requirements with the video content. More
importantly, we propose two novel filtering policies that can be updated when
user interaction is continually performed. Finally, we provide a new benchmark
for personalized video dataset collection, and carefully conduct the user study
to verify our agent's usage in various real scenarios. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our agent for customized video

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance on traditional
benchmarks, there is an urgent need for more challenging evaluation frameworks
that probe deeper aspects of semantic understanding. We introduce SAGE
(Semantic Alignment & Generalization Evaluation), a rigorous benchmark designed
to assess both embedding models and similarity metrics across five categories:
Human Preference Alignment, Transformation Robustness, Information Sensitivity,
Clustering Performance, and Retrieval Robustness. Unlike existing benchmarks
that focus on isolated capabilities, SAGE evaluates semantic understanding
through adversarial conditions, noisy transformations, and nuanced human
judgment tasks across 30+ datasets. Our comprehensive evaluation of 9 embedding
models and classical metrics reveals significant performance gaps, with no
single approach excelling across all dimensions. For instance, while
state-of-the-art embedding models like OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large dominate
in aligning with human preferences (0.682 vs. 0.591 for the best classical
metric), they are significantly outperformed by classical metrics on
information sensitivity tasks, where Jaccard Similarity achieves a score of
0.905 compared to the top embedding score of 0.794. SAGE further uncovers
critical trade-offs: OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small achieves the highest
clustering performance (0.483) but demonstrates extreme brittleness with the
lowest robustness score (0.011). SAGE exposes critical limitations in current
semantic understanding capabilities and provides a more realistic assessment of
model robustness for real-world deployment.

*Mohammad Reza Zarei,Barbara Stead-Coyle,Michael Christensen,Sarah Everts,Majid Komeili*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: 该研究分析了TikTok、Instagram和YouTube平台上营养和补充剂视频中可信度的包装方式，重点关注权威信号、叙事技巧和盈利模式的交叉点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 短视频平台已成为健康建议的重要来源，但其中混杂着有用、误导性和有害的内容。研究旨在理解这些平台上可信度是如何被构建的，而不是判断内容的真实性。

Method: 收集了152个公开视频，通过自动语音识别、原则性帧选择和多模态模型构建透明标注流程，并对26个特征进行人工验证标注，涵盖视觉权威、主持人属性、叙事策略和参与度提示。

Result: 研究发现自信的单一主持人在工作室或家庭环境中占主导地位，临床环境罕见。权威线索（如头衔、幻灯片、证书）常与说服性元素（术语、引用、恐惧或紧迫感、批评主流医学、阴谋论）和盈利模式（销售链接、订阅呼吁）同时出现。

Conclusion: 科学类视觉元素和引用往往与情感化和对立性叙事相伴，而非表示克制，这揭示了健康内容中可信度构建的复杂机制。

Abstract: Short form video platforms are central sites for health advice, where
alternative narratives mix useful, misleading, and harmful content. Rather than
adjudicating truth, this study examines how credibility is packaged in
nutrition and supplement videos by analyzing the intersection of authority
signals, narrative techniques, and monetization. We assemble a cross platform
corpus of 152 public videos from TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube and annotate
each on 26 features spanning visual authority, presenter attributes, narrative
strategies, and engagement cues. A transparent annotation pipeline integrates
automatic speech recognition, principled frame selection, and a multimodal
model, with human verification on a stratified subsample showing strong
agreement. Descriptively, a confident single presenter in studio or home
settings dominates, and clinical contexts are rare. Analytically, authority
cues such as titles, slides and charts, and certificates frequently occur with
persuasive elements including jargon, references, fear or urgency, critiques of
mainstream medicine, and conspiracies, and with monetization including sales
links and calls to subscribe. References and science like visuals often travel
with emotive and oppositional narratives rather than signaling restraint.

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了群体锚点的概念，研究如何识别群体互动中的关键成员，并开发了AnchorRadar方法在标签稀缺情况下进行半监督识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在现实世界的群体互动中（如合著论文、邮件通信、在线问答），往往存在一个特别重要的成员作为群体的核心。识别这些群体锚点对于理解群体结构和动态具有重要意义。

Method: 开发了AnchorRadar方法，这是一种快速有效的半监督方法，利用有已知锚点和无已知锚点的群体信息，在标签稀缺的现实场景下进行群体锚点识别。

Result: 在13个真实世界数据集上的实验表明，AnchorRadar在准确性和效率方面优于各种基线方法。在大多数情况下，AnchorRadar的识别准确率最高，同时训练时间比最快的基线少10.2倍，可学习参数比最轻量级基线少43.6倍。

Conclusion: AnchorRadar是一种高效准确的群体锚点识别方法，特别适用于标签稀缺的现实场景，为理解群体互动中的关键角色提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Group interactions occur in various real-world contexts, e.g., co-authorship,
email communication, and online Q&A. In each group, there is often a
particularly significant member, around whom the group is formed. Examples
include the first or last author of a paper, the sender of an email, and the
questioner in a Q&A session. In this work, we discuss the existence of such
individuals in real-world group interactions. We call such individuals group
anchors and study the problem of identifying them. First, we introduce the
concept of group anchors and the identification problem. Then, we discuss our
observations on group anchors in real-world group interactions. Based on our
observations, we develop AnchorRadar, a fast and effective method for group
anchor identification under realistic settings with label scarcity, i.e., when
only a few groups have known anchors. AnchorRadar is a semi-supervised method
using information from groups both with and without known group anchors.
Finally, through extensive experiments on thirteen real-world datasets, we
demonstrate the empirical superiority of AnchorRadar over various baselines
w.r.t. accuracy and efficiency. In most cases, AnchorRadar achieves higher
accuracy in group anchor identification than all the baselines, while using
10.2$\times$ less training time than the fastest baseline and 43.6$\times$
fewer learnable parameters than the most lightweight baseline on average.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了匿名在线对话中多数群体如何影响个体判断形成与表达，发现系统性的反从众行为


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在线环境与线下环境相比如何重塑社会影响，特别是在匿名自发性对话中多数群体对个体判断的影响

Method: 使用数字痕迹操作化判断，测量对话分歧并应用贝叶斯回归分析群体暴露前后的判断形成变化；通过语言分析判断表达的变化

Result: 个体保持多数群体的判断正负取向但偏离其立场，披露后说服性语言增加，显示系统性反从众行为

Conclusion: 在线环境相比线下环境重塑了社会影响机制，个体在匿名对话中表现出独特的反从众模式

Abstract: This study investigates how the majority group influences individual judgment
formation and expression in anonymous, spontaneous online conversations.
Drawing on theories of social conformity and anti-conformity, we analyze
everyday dilemmas discussed on social media. First, using digital traces to
operationalize judgments, we measure the conversations' disagreement and apply
Bayesian regression to capture shifts of judgments formation before and after
the group's exposure. Then we analyze changes in judgment expression with a
linguistic analysis of the motivations associated with each judgment. Results
show systematic anti-conformity behaviors: individuals preserve the majority's
positive or negative orientation of judgments but diverge from its stance, with
persuasive language increasing post-disclosure. Our findings highlight how
online environments reshape social influence compared to offline contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 技术融合已成为创新主流趋势，但准确测量技术融合仍面临挑战，因为其具有多维度和动态演化的特性。

Method: 使用IPC文本描述和专利元数据构建异构图，结合异构图变换器和Sentence-BERT计算深度维度；通过香农多样性指数衡量广度维度；最后用熵权法构建综合TCI指标。

Result: 提出的TCI指标相比现有方法具有比较优势，通过专利质量指标的回归分析验证了其稳健性。

Conclusion: 这种多维方法为创新政策和行业战略管理新兴跨领域技术提供了有价值的实践见解。

Abstract: Technological convergence refers to the phenomenon where boundaries between
technological areas and disciplines are increasingly blurred. It enables the
integration of previously distinct domains and has become a mainstream trend in
today's innovation process. However, accurately measuring technological
convergence remains a persistent challenge due to its inherently
multidimensional and evolving nature. This study designs an Technological
Convergence Index (TCI) that comprehensively measures convergence along two
fundamental dimensions: depth and breadth. For depth calculation, we use IPC
textual descriptions as the analytical foundation and enhance this assessment
by incorporating supplementary patent metadata into a heterogeneous graph
structure. This graph is then modeled using Heterogeneous Graph Transformers in
combination with Sentence-BERT, enabling a precise representation of knowledge
integration across technological boundaries. Complementing this, the breadth
dimension captures the diversity of technological fields involved, quantified
through the Shannon Diversity Index to measure the variety of technological
combinations within patents. Our final TCI is constructed using the Entropy
Weight Method, which objectively assigns weights to both dimensions based on
their information entropy. To validate our approach, we compare the proposed
TCI against established convergence measures, demonstrating its comparative
advantages. We further establish empirical reliability through a novel
robustness test that regresses TCI against indicators of patent quality. These
findings are further substantiated through comprehensive robustness checks. Our
multidimensional approach provides valuable practical insights for innovation
policy and industry strategies in managing emerging cross-domain technologies.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个基于深度强化学习的方法来解决重叠社区中的社区成员隐藏问题，通过在保持图结构的同时修改边来保护节点隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的图通常具有重叠社区结构，而现有的社区成员隐藏方法主要针对非重叠社区，在重叠社区中效果不佳。需要一种能够有效保护节点隐私而不显著改变图拓扑的方法。

Method: 采用深度强化学习（DRL）方法，学习有效的边修改策略，包括使用代理节点，同时保持图结构的完整性。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的实验表明，该方法在有效性和效率方面显著优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为具有重叠社区的隐私保护图修改提供了一个原则性的工具，能够有效隐藏目标节点的社区成员身份。

Abstract: Protecting privacy in social graphs requires preventing sensitive
information, such as community affiliations, from being inferred by graph
analysis, without substantially altering the graph topology. We address this
through the problem of \emph{community membership hiding} (CMH), which seeks
edge modifications that cause a target node to exit its original community,
regardless of the detection algorithm employed. Prior work has focused on
non-overlapping community detection, where trivial strategies often suffice,
but real-world graphs are better modeled by overlapping communities, where such
strategies fail. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to formalize
and address CMH in this setting. In this work, we propose a deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) approach that learns effective modification policies, including
the use of proxy nodes, while preserving graph structure. Experiments on
real-world datasets show that our method significantly outperforms existing
baselines in both effectiveness and efficiency, offering a principled tool for
privacy-preserving graph modification with overlapping communities.

Main category: cs.SY

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Atangana-Baleanu Caputo型分数阶导数的广义逻辑增长模型扩展，包含比例时滞，采用HSV方法求解，用于描述具有记忆依赖和非局部动态的约束增长现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典逻辑增长模型无法充分描述具有记忆依赖和非局部动态的约束增长现象，需要开发更灵活的建模框架来适应工业、医疗和社会系统中的复杂增长过程。

Method: 使用Atangana-Baleanu Caputo型分数阶导数构建广义逻辑增长模型，引入比例时滞，并采用混合Sumudu变分方法获得半解析解。

Result: 研究结果揭示了分数阶阶数和时滞对系统行为的联合影响，验证了该方法在捕捉复杂动态方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过整合ABC型导数、比例时滞和HSV求解方法，为现实世界应用提供了一种新颖的建模框架。

Abstract: The logistic growth model is a classical framework for describing constrained
growth phenomena, widely applied in areas such as population dynamics,
epidemiology, and resource management. This study presents a generalized
extension using Atangana-Baleanu in Caputo sense (ABC)-type fractional
derivatives. Proportional time delay is also included, allowing the model to
capture memory-dependent and nonlocal dynamics not addressed in classical
formulations. Free parameters provide flexibility for modeling complex growth
in industrial, medical, and social systems. The Hybrid Sumudu Variational (HSV)
method is employed to efficiently obtain semi-analytical solutions. Results
highlight the combined effects of fractional order and delay on system
behavior. This approach demonstrates the novelty of integrating ABC-type
derivatives, proportional delay, and HSV-based solutions for real-world
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 整合现有关于劳动力市场三个关键领域（非正规性、最低工资效应、买方垄断权力）的系统性综述和元分析，检验其因果关系、后果及相关公共政策，挑战传统观点。

Method: 采用元分析和元回归方法，整合多个现有系统性综述和元分析的研究发现，并引入一个综合理论模型，同时考虑企业异质性、买方垄断权力和内生正规化决策。

Result: 发现传统观点高估了效应大小；降低正规化成本的政策效果有限，而加强执法更有效；最低工资对就业的影响适度；存在普遍的发表偏倚，校正后的估计值趋近于零。

Conclusion: 元回归是识别异质性和真实效应的关键工具，需要重新校准理论和政策建议，采用更细致和综合的方法。

Abstract: This document offers a synthesis of recent economic literature on three
interconnected areas of labor markets: informality, the effects of the minimum
wage, and monopsony power. Through the consolidation and meta-analysis of
findings from multiple existing systematic reviews and meta-analyses, their
causes, consequences, and associated public policies are examined. It is
concluded that conventional views on these topics often overestimate the
magnitude of effects. Policies to reduce informality based solely on lowering
formalization costs are largely ineffective, while increased enforcement at the
extensive margin shows more promising results. The effects of the minimum wage
on employment, measured through the own-wage elasticity (OWE), are consistently
modest, suggesting that job losses are limited compared to wage gains. To
reconcile and microfound these findings, an integrated theoretical model of
firm optimization is introduced, simultaneously incorporating firm
heterogeneity, monopsony power, and endogenous formality decisions, rigorously
demonstrating how the interaction of these forces can explain the observed
empirical regularities. A cross-cutting and significant finding is the
omnipresence of publication bias across all these study areas, which tends to
inflate the magnitude of the effects reported in the published literature.
Corrected estimates of the effects generally approach zero. Meta-regression is
established as an indispensable tool for identifying heterogeneity and the true
underlying effects in the empirical evidence, compelling a recalibration of
both theory and economic policy recommendations towards a more nuanced and
integrated approach.

Motivation: 解决Börgers(1995)中关于占优策略实现的开放性问题，挑战传统认为纳什实现需要可分性、拟线性或无限行动集等严格假设的认知。

Method: 研究随机有限行动机制，分析实现占优策略和迭代占优策略的条件和方法。

Result: 建立了可能性和不可能性结果，证明了在有限行动集下也能实现占优策略，这是超越传统假设的首个积极结果。

Conclusion: 该研究扩展了机制设计的理论边界，表明即使在没有传统严格假设的情况下，也能在有限行动机制中实现占优策略。

Abstract: Focusing on stochastic finite-action mechanisms, we study implementation in
undominated strategies and iteratively undominated strategies. We establish
both possibility and impossibility results that resolve the open question in
B\"orgers (1995). Contrary to the conventional understanding that positive
results on Nash implementation need separability, quasilinearity, or infinite
action sets, we provide -- to our knowledge -- the first positive result beyond
those demanding assumptions.
