We propose a conjugate Bayesian dynamic Gamma model with a common random environment that resolves this trade-off. Each segment's travel time follows a Gamma distribution conditional on a shared latent environment process that evolves as a Markov chain, inducing cross-segment dependence while preserving conditional independence. A moment-matching approximation yields a closed-form $F$-distribution for route travel time, from which the Planning Time Index, Buffer Index, and on-time probability are computed instantly -- at the same $O(1)$ cost as independence-based methods. The conjugate structure ensures that Bayesian posterior updates and the full predictive distribution are available in closed form as new sensor data arrives. Applied to 16 sensors spanning 8.26 miles on I-55 in Chicago, the model achieves 95.4% coverage of nominal 90\\% predictive intervals versus 34--37% for independence-based convolution, at identical computational cost."}

Assessing the consistency of treatment effects across regions is a fundamental aspect of MRCTs. Existing methods typically focus on region-specific marginal treatment effects. However, when treatment effect heterogeneity arises due to effect-modifying baseline covariates, distributional differences in these covariates can lead to erroneous conclusions. In this paper, we explicitly account for this phenomenon in the consistency assessment by considering the conditional average treatment effect. We propose a two-step assessment strategy that complements existing methods and mitigates the impact of treatment effect heterogeneity. Results from numerical studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach."}

To unpack this phenomenon, this study disentangles age, period, and cohort effects on digital exclusion among middle-aged and older Chinese adults. Using three nationally representative surveys (CHARLS 2011-2020, CFPS 2010-2022, and CGSS 2010-2021), we fitted hierarchical age-period-cohort (HAPC) models weighted by cross-sectional survey weights and stabilized inverse probability weights for item response. We further assessed heterogeneity by urban-rural residence, region, multimorbidity, and cognitive risk, and evaluated robustness with APC bounding analyses. Across datasets, digital exclusion increased with age and displayed mild non-linearity, with a small midlife easing followed by a sharper rise at older ages. Period effects declined over the 2010s and early 2020s, although the pace of improvement differed across survey windows. Cohort deviations were present but less consistent than age and period patterns, with an additional excess risk concentrated among cohorts born in the 1950s. Rural and western residents, as well as adults with multimorbidity or cognitive risk, remained consistently more excluded. Over the study period, the urban-rural divide showed no evidence of narrowing, whereas the cognitive-risk gap widened. These findings highlight digital inclusion as a vital pathway for older adults to remain integral participants in an evolving digital society."}

In these local regions of degeneracy the limiting behaviors of plug-in estimators depend on nuisance parameters that are not consistently estimable. We show that this failure is intrinsic -- around points of degeneracy, both regular and quantile-unbiased estimation are impossible. Despite these restrictions, we develop minimum-distance methods that deliver uniformly valid confidence intervals. We establish sufficient conditions under which standard chi-square critical values remain valid, and propose a simple bootstrap procedure when they are not.

In this paper, we present LLM-FSM, a benchmark that evaluates how well large language models (LLMs) can recover finite-state machine (FSM) behavior from natural-language specifications and translate it into correct register transfer-level (RTL) implementations. Unlike prior specification-to-RTL benchmarks that rely on manually constructed examples, LLM-FSM is built through a fully automated pipeline. LLM-FSM first constructs FSM with configurable state counts and constrained transition structures. It then prompts LLMs to express each FSM in a structured YAML format with an application context, and to further convert that YAML into a natural-language (NL) specification. From the same YAML, our pipeline synthesizes the reference RTL and testbench in a correct-by-construction manner. All 1,000 problems are verified using LLM-based and SAT-solver-based checks, with human review on a subset. Our experiments show that even the strongest LLMs exhibit sharply declining accuracy as FSM complexity increases. We further demonstrate that training-time scaling via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) generalizes effectively to out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks, while increasing test-time compute improves reasoning reliability. Finally, LLM-FSM remains extensible by allowing its FSM complexity to scale with future model capabilities."}

While the Markov approach is the classical analytical foundation, its reliance on the exponential distribution for failure and repair times is a major and often unrealistic limitation. This paper directly overcomes this critical constraint by investigating and modeling system maintainability using the more flexible and versatile Lindley distribution, which is represented via phase-type distributions. We first present a comprehensive maintainability analysis of a single-component system, deriving precise closed-form expressions for its time-dependent and steady-state availability, as well as the mean time to repair. The core methodology is then systematically generalized to analyze common series and parallel system configurations with n independent and identically distributed components. A dedicated numerical study compares the system performance under the Lindley and exponential distributions, conclusively demonstrating the significant and practical impact of non-exponential repair times on key reliability metrics. Our work provides a versatile and more widely applicable analytical framework for accurate maintainability assessment that successfully relaxes the restrictive exponential assumption, thereby offering greater realism in reliability modeling."}

Here we introduce a physical analog KAN architecture in which edge functions are realized in materia using reconfigurable nonlinear-processing units (RNPUs): multi-terminal nanoscale silicon devices whose input-output characteristics are tuned via control voltages. By combining multiple RNPUs into an edge processor and assembling these blocks into a reconfigurable analog KAN (aKAN) architecture with integrated mixed-signal interfacing, we establish a realistic system-level hardware implementation that enables compact KAN-style regression and classification with programmable nonlinear transformations. Using experimentally calibrated RNPU models and hardware measurements, we demonstrate accurate function approximation across increasing task complexity while requiring fewer or comparable trainable parameters than multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). System-level estimates indicate an energy per inference of $\\sim$250 pJ and an end-to-end inference latency of $\\sim$600 ns for a representative workload, corresponding to a $\\sim$10$^{2}$-10$^{3}\\times$ reduction in energy accompanied by a $\\sim$10$\\times$ reduction in area compared to a digital fixed-point MLP at similar approximation error.

Insights from human capital theory suggest such violations are likely: higher-ability individuals delay childbirth and have steeper earnings growth, a mechanism that causes conventional estimates to understate child penalties for early-treated parents. Using Israeli administrative data, a bias-bounding exercise suggests substantial understatement for early groups. As a solution, I propose targeting the effect of parenthood on the gender earnings ratio and show this new estimand is identified under NTD."}

However, existing GDA methods typically assume that both source and target graphs exhibit homophily, leading existing methods to perform poorly when heterophily is present. Furthermore, the lack of labels in the target graph makes it impossible to assess its homophily level beforehand. To address this challenge, we propose a novel homophily-agnostic approach that effectively transfers knowledge between graphs with varying degrees of homophily. Specifically, we adopt a divide-and-conquer strategy that first separately reconstructs highly homophilic and heterophilic variants of both the source and target graphs, and then performs knowledge alignment separately between corresponding graph variants. Extensive experiments conducted on five benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our approach, particularly highlighting its substantial advantages on heterophilic graphs."}

We use these models to estimate Server Quality Scores (SQS) that reflect players' serving ability.

Across tens of thousands of commented threads, Moltbook discussions are dominated by first-layer reactions rather than extended chains. Most comments never receive a direct reply, reciprocal back-and-forth is rare, and when replies do occur they arrive almost immediately -- typically within seconds -- implying persistence on the order of minutes rather than hours. Moltbook is often described as running on an approximately four-hour ``heartbeat'' check-in schedule; using aggregate spectral tests on the longest contiguous activity window, we do not detect a reliable four-hour rhythm in this snapshot, consistent with jittered or out-of-phase individual schedules.

Existing fairness assessments are typically conducted by AI experts or regulators using predefined protected attributes and metrics, which often fail to capture the diversity and nuance of fairness notions held by the individuals who are affected by these systems' decisions, such as decision subjects. Recent work has therefore called for involving affected individuals in fairness assessment, yet little empirical evidence exists on how they create their own fairness criteria or what kinds of criteria they produce - knowledge that could not only inform experts' fairness evaluation and mitigation, but also guide the design of AI assessment tools. We address this gap through a qualitative user study with 18 participants in a credit rating scenario. Participants first articulated their fairness notions in their own words. Then, participants turned them into concrete quantified and operationalized fairness criteria, through an interactive prototype we designed.

Meanwhile, despite the rapid advancement of Search Agents, their practical deployment is constrained by a fundamental limitation, termed as 1) Latency Challenge: the serial execution of multi-round reasoning, tool calling, and tool response waiting under the ReAct agent paradigm induces severe end-to-end latency. Intuitively, dLLMs can leverage their distinctive strengths to optimize the operational efficiency of agents under the ReAct agent paradigm. Practically, existing dLLM backbones face the 2) Agent Ability Challenge. That is, existing dLLMs exhibit remarkably weak reasoning and tool-calling capabilities, preventing these advantages from being effectively realized in practice. In this paper, we propose DLLM-Searcher, an optimization framework for dLLM-based Search Agents. To solve the Agent Ability Challenge, we design a two-stage post-training pipeline encompassing Agentic Supervised Fine-Tuning (Agentic SFT) and Agentic Variance-Reduced Preference Optimization Agentic VRPO, which enhances the backbone dLLM's information seeking and reasoning capabilities. To mitigate the Latency Challenge, we leverage the flexible generation mechanism of dLLMs and propose a novel agent paradigm termed Parallel-Reasoning and Acting P-ReAct. P-ReAct guides the model to prioritize decoding tool_call instructions, thereby allowing the model to keep thinking while waiting for the tool's return. Experimental results demonstrate that DLLM-Searcher achieves performance comparable to mainstream LLM-based search agents and P-ReAct delivers approximately 15% inference acceleration.

Existing fairness assessments are typically conducted by AI experts or regulators using predefined protected attributes and metrics, which often fail to capture the diversity and nuance of fairness notions held by the individuals who are affected by these systems' decisions, such as decision subjects. Recent work has therefore called for involving affected individuals in fairness assessment, yet little empirical evidence exists on how they create their own fairness criteria or what kinds of criteria they produce - knowledge that could not only inform experts' fairness evaluation and mitigation, but also guide the design of AI assessment tools. We address this gap through a qualitative user study with 18 participants in a credit rating scenario. Participants first articulated their fairness notions in their own words. Then, participants turned them into concrete quantified and operationalized fairness criteria, through an interactive prototype we designed. Our findings provide empirical evidence of the process through which people's fairness notions emerge via grounding in model features, and uncover a diverse set of individuals' custom-defined criteria for both outcome and procedural fairness.

Trial designs based on incomplete or imprecise summaries can lead to misspecified hypotheses and underpowered studies, resulting in false positive or negative conclusions. To address this challenge, we developed LEAD-ONC (Literature to Evidence for Analytics and Design in Oncology), an AI-assisted framework that transforms published clinical trial reports into quantitative, design-relevant evidence. Given expert-curated trial publications that meet prespecified eligibility criteria, LEAD-ONC uses large language models to extract baseline characteristics and reconstruct individual patient data from Kaplan-Meier curves, followed by Bayesian hierarchical modeling to generate predictive survival distributions for a prespecified target trial population. We demonstrate the framework using five phase III trials in first-line non-small-cell lung cancer evaluating PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors with or without CTLA-4 blockade. Clustering based on baseline characteristics identified three clinically interpretable populations defined by histology. For a prospective randomized trial in the mixed-histology population comparing mono versus dual immune checkpoint inhibition, LEAD-ONC projected a modest median overall survival difference of 2.8 months (95 percent credible interval -2.0 to 7.6) and an estimated probability of at least a 3-month benefit of approximately 0.45. As LEAD-ONC remains under active development, these results are intended as preliminary demonstrations of the frameworks potential to support evidence-driven oncology trial design rather than definitive clinical conclusions."}

However, the existing channel estimation frameworks for ODDM systems cannot achieve both high accuracy and low complexity simultaneously, due to the inherent coupling of delay and Doppler parameters. To address this problem, a two-dimensional (2D) hierarchical sparse Bayesian learning (HSBL) based channel estimation framework is proposed in this paper. Specifically, we address the inherent coupling between delay and Doppler dimensions in ODDM by developing a partially-decoupled 2D sparse signal recovery (SSR) formulation on a virtual sampling grid defined in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain. With the help of the partially-decoupled formulation, the proposed 2D HSBL framework first performs low-complexity coarse on-grid 2D sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) estimation to identify potential channel paths. Then, high-resolution fine grids are constructed around these regions, where an off-grid 2D SBL estimation is applied to achieve accurate channel estimation. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves performance superior to conventional off-grid 2D SBL with significantly reduced computational complexity."}

Such spillovers bias causal estimates and undermine experimental conclusions. Existing approaches face key limitations: user-level randomization ignores network structure, while cluster-based methods often rely on general-purpose clustering that is not tailored for spillover containment and has difficulty balancing unbiasedness and statistical power at scale. We propose a spillover-contained experimentation framework with two stages. In the pre-experiment stage, we build social interaction graphs and introduce a Balanced Louvain algorithm that produces stable, size-balanced clusters while minimizing cross-cluster edges, enabling reliable cluster-based randomization. In the post-experiment stage, we develop a tailored CUPAC estimator that leverages pre-experiment behavioral covariates to reduce the variance induced by cluster-level assignment, thereby improving statistical power. Together, these components provide both structural spillover containment and robust statistical inference. We validate our approach through large-scale social sharing experiments on Kuaishou, a platform serving hundreds of millions of users. Results show that our method substantially reduces spillover and yields more accurate assessments of social strategies than traditional user-level designs, establishing a reliable and scalable framework for networked A/B testing."}

We apply a multistate modeling framework tailored to interval-censored illness-death data and define three non-overlapping birth cohorts (1915-1924, 1925-1934, and 1935-1944). Trends are evaluated based on both dementia prevalence and dementia risk, using age as the underlying timescale. Additionally, age-conditional dementia probabilities stratified by sex are estimated.\n  Results: A total of 731 out of 3828 individuals were diagnosed with dementia. The multistate model analysis revealed no temporal decline in dementia risk across birth cohorts, irrespective of sex. When stratified by sex and adjusted for education, women consistently exhibited higher lifetime age-conditional risks (46%-50%) than men (30%-34%) over the study period.\n  Conclusions: We recommend using a combination of multistate approach and separation into birth cohorts to adequately estimate trends of disease risk in cohort studies as well as to communicate patient-relevant outcomes such age-conditional disease risks."}

Photonic analog systems are emerging with solutions of intrinsic parallelism, high bandwidth, and low propagation loss. However, their application has been hindered by the low analog accuracy due to the electro-optic distortion, material nonlinearities, and signal-to-noise ratios. Here we overcome this barrier with a quantization-aware digital-photonic mixed-precision framework across chiplets for accelerated AI processing and physical simulation. Using Lithium Niobate photonics with channel equalization techniques, we demonstrate linear multiplication (9-bit amplitude-phase decoupling) in homodyne optical logics with 6-bit precision at the clock rate of 128 giga-symbol-per-second (128 GS/s), enabling AI processing with 6 ns latency. Codesign hardware-algorithms, including iterative solvers, sparse-dense quantization, and bit-sliced matrix multiplication, explore photonic amplitude and phase coherence for complex-valued, physics-inspired computation. In electromagnetic problems, our approach yields 12-bit solutions for partial differential equations (PDEs) in scattering problems that would conventionally require up to 32-bit and often even 64-bit precision. These results preserve digital-level fidelity while leveraging the high-speed low-energy photonic hardware, establishing a pathway toward general-purpose optical acceleration for generative artificial intelligence, real-time robotics, and accurate simulation for climate challenges and biological discoveries."}

Additionally, we developed a matching weight filtering algorithm that evaluates the quality of sample points in the input dataset and assigns different weight values to samples based on their quality.

This perspective allows for a precise analysis of how network structure, stubborn agents (boundary), and susceptible agents (interior) collectively determine the evolution of opinions. We derive the transient and steady-state solutions using two distinct but related approaches: a general resolvent-based method applicable to agents with heterogeneous susceptibilities, and a spectral method valid for the special case of homogeneous susceptibility. We further establish quantitative convergence rates to the steady state, derive explicit sensitivity formulas with respect to susceptibility parameters, and prove perturbation bounds under changes in the influence matrix. Moreover, we formally define a set of influenceability measures and prove some of their basic properties. Finally, we provide a Monte Carlo illustration on the Zachary karate club graph, showing how the proposed opinion broadcasting centralities and centralizations behave under random susceptibility profiles and how they relate to classical network centralities."}

While multimodal foundation models excel at passive perception, their capacity for active, self-directed exploration remains understudied. We propose Theory of Space, defined as an agent's ability to actively acquire information through self-directed, active exploration and to construct, revise, and exploit a spatial belief from sequential, partial observations. We evaluate this through a benchmark where the goal is curiosity-driven exploration to build an accurate cognitive map. A key innovation is spatial belief probing, which prompts models to reveal their internal spatial representations at each step. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art models reveals several critical bottlenecks. First, we identify an Active-Passive Gap, where performance drops significantly when agents must autonomously gather information. Second, we find high inefficiency, as models explore unsystematically compared to program-based proxies. Through belief probing, we diagnose that while perception is an initial bottleneck, global beliefs suffer from instability that causes spatial knowledge to degrade over time. Finally, using a false belief paradigm, we uncover Belief Inertia, where agents fail to update obsolete priors with new evidence. This issue is present in text-based agents but is particularly severe in vision-based models. Our findings suggest that current foundation models struggle to maintain coherent, revisable spatial beliefs during active exploration."}

These projections must consider the logistical complexities introduced by adverse met-ocean conditions that can prohibit access to the offshore assets for sustained periods of time. In response, the goal of this study is two-fold: (1) to provide high-resolution estimates of the accessibility of key offshore wind energy areas in the United States (U.S.) East Coast--a region with significant offshore wind energy potential; and (2) to introduce a new operational metric, called serviceability, as motivated by the need to assess the accessibility of an offshore asset along a vessel travel path, rather than at a specific site, as commonly carried out in the literature. We hypothesize that serviceability is more relevant to offshore operations than accessibility, since it more realistically reflects the success and safety of a vessel operation along its journey from port to site and back. Our analysis reveals high temporal and spatial variations in accessibility and serviceability, even for proximate offshore locations. We also find that solely relying on numerical met-ocean data can introduce considerable bias in estimating accessibility and serviceability, raising the need for a statistical treatment that combines both numerical and observational data sources, such as the one proposed herein. Collectively, our analysis sheds light on the value of high-resolution met-ocean information and models in supporting offshore operations, including but not limited to future offshore wind energy developments."}

The GNN effectively represents the complex state of jobs, machines, and setups, allowing the PPO agent to learn a direct scheduling policy. Guided by a multi-objective reward function, the agent simultaneously minimizes TWT and TST. Experimental results on benchmark instances demonstrate that our PPO-GNN agent significantly outperforms a standard dispatching rule and a metaheuristic, achieving a superior trade-off between both objectives.

It is well known that social learning in this setting can be highly fragile: small changes to the action ordering, network topology, or even the strength of the agents' private signals can prevent a network from converging to the truth. We study networks that achieve random-order asymptotic truth learning, in which almost all agents learn the ground truth when the decision ordering is selected uniformly at random. We analyze the robustness of these networks, showing that those achieving random-order asymptotic truth learning are resilient to a bounded number of adversarial modifications. We characterize necessary conditions for such networks to succeed in this setting and introduce several graph constructions that learn through different mechanisms. Finally, we present a randomized polynomial-time algorithm that transforms an arbitrary network into one achieving random-order learning using minimal edge or vertex modifications, with provable approximation guarantees. Our results reveal structural properties of networks that achieve random-order learning and provide algorithmic tools for designing robust social networks."}

We study Moltbook, an AI-agent social network, using a first-week snapshot and introduce interaction half-life: how quickly a comment's chance of receiving a direct reply fades as the comment ages. Across tens of thousands of commented threads, Moltbook discussions are dominated by first-layer reactions rather than extended chains. Most comments never receive a direct reply, reciprocal back-and-forth is rare, and when replies do occur they arrive almost immediately -- typically within seconds -- implying persistence on the order of minutes rather than hours. Moltbook is often described as running on an approximately four-hour ``heartbeat'' check-in schedule; using aggregate spectral tests on the longest contiguous activity window, we do not detect a reliable four-hour rhythm in this snapshot, consistent with jittered or out-of-phase individual schedules. A contemporaneous Reddit baseline analyzed with the same estimators shows substantially deeper threads and much longer reply persistence. Overall, early agent social interaction on Moltbook fits a ``fast response or silence'' regime, suggesting that sustained multi-step coordination will likely require explicit memory, thread resurfacing, and re-entry scaffolds."}

In this paper, we identify this assumption as Dogma 4 of Reinforcement Learning (RL). We demonstrate that while this dogma holds in static environments, it fails in social settings where evaluators may be sycophantic, lazy, or adversarial. We prove that under Dogma 4, standard RL agents suffer from what we call Objective Decoupling, a structural failure mode where the agent's learned objective permanently separates from the latent ground truth, guaranteeing convergence to misalignment. To resolve this, we propose Epistemic Source Alignment (ESA). Unlike standard robust methods that rely on statistical consensus (trusting the majority), ESA utilizes sparse safety axioms to judge the source of the feedback rather than the signal itself. We prove that this \"judging the judges\" mechanism guarantees convergence to the true objective, even when a majority of evaluators are biased. Empirically, we show that while traditional consensus methods fail under majority collusion, our approach successfully recovers the optimal policy."}

We establish a central limit theorem based on the orthogonal moments without relying on exogeneity assumptions between panel data residuals and the cross-sectional moment functions.

The main substitute being proposed is community-based contextualization, most notably Community Notes on X, where users write annotations and collectively rate their helpfulness under a consensus-oriented algorithm. This shift raises a basic empirical question: to what extent do users' social dynamics affect the emergence of Community Notes? We address this question by characterizing participation and political behavior, using the full public release of notes and ratings (between 2021 and 2025). We show that contribution activity is highly concentrated: a small minority of users accounts for a disproportionate share of ratings. Crucially, these high-activity contributors are not neutral volunteers: they are selective in the content they engage with and substantially more politically polarized than the overall contributor population. We replicate the notes' emergence process by integrating the open-source implementation of the Community Notes consensus algorithm used in production. This enables us to conduct counterfactual simulations that modify the display status of notes by varying the pool of raters. Our results reveal that the system is structurally unstable: the emergence and visibility of notes often depend on the behavior of a few dozen highly active users, and even minor perturbations in their participation can lead to markedly different outcomes. In sum, rather than decentralizing epistemic authority, community-based fact-checking on X reconfigures it, concentrating substantial power in the hands of a small, polarized group of highly active contributors."}

In this work, we introduce PreFlect, a prospective reflection mechanism that shifts the paradigm from post hoc correction to pre-execution foresight by criticizing and refining agent plans before execution. To support grounded prospective reflection, we distill planning errors from historical agent trajectories, capturing recurring success and failure patterns observed across past executions. Furthermore, we complement prospective reflection with a dynamic re-planning mechanism that provides execution-time plan update in case the original plan encounters unexpected deviation. Evaluations on different benchmarks demonstrate that PreFlect significantly improves overall agent utility on complex real-world tasks, outperforming strong reflection-based baselines and several more complex agent architectures.

In this paper, we present LLM-FSM, a benchmark that evaluates how well large language models (LLMs) can recover finite-state machine (FSM) behavior from natural-language specifications and translate it into correct register transfer-level (RTL) implementations. Unlike prior specification-to-RTL benchmarks that rely on manually constructed examples, LLM-FSM is built through a fully automated pipeline. LLM-FSM first constructs FSM with configurable state counts and constrained transition structures. It then prompts LLMs to express each FSM in a structured YAML format with an application context, and to further convert that YAML into a natural-language (NL) specification. From the same YAML, our pipeline synthesizes the reference RTL and testbench in a correct-by-construction manner. All 1,000 problems are verified using LLM-based and SAT-solver-based checks, with human review on a subset. Our experiments show that even the strongest LLMs exhibit sharply declining accuracy as FSM complexity increases. We further demonstrate that training-time scaling via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) generalizes effectively to out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks, while increasing test-time compute improves reasoning reliability. Finally, LLM-FSM remains extensible by allowing its FSM complexity to scale with future model capabilities."}

To address this gap, we develop a framework of \\emph{structural transparency} for analyzing organizational and institutional decisions concerning AI alignment, drawing on the theoretical lens of Institutional Logics. We develop a categorization of organizational decisions that are present in the governance of AI alignment, and provide an explicit analytical approach to examining them. We operationalize the framework through five analytical components, each with an accompanying \"analyst recipe\" that collectively identify the primary institutional logics and their internal relationships, external disruptions to existing social orders, and finally, how the structural risks of each institutional logic are mapped to a catalogue of sociotechnical harms. The proposed concept of structural transparency enables analysts to complement existing approached based on informational transparency with macro-level analyses that capture the institutional dynamics and consequences of decisions regarding AI alignment."}

We find clear evidence of developer-specific efficiency advantages, but their importance depends on where models lie in the performance distribution. At the frontier, 80-90% of performance differences are explained by higher training compute, implying that scale--not proprietary technology--drives frontier advances. Away from the frontier, however, proprietary techniques and shared algorithmic progress substantially reduce the compute required to reach fixed capability thresholds.

Accepted for LAK2026", "summary": "The rapid adoption of digital technologies has greatly increased the volume of real-world data (RWD) in education. While these data offer significant opportunities for advancing learning analytics (LA), secondary use for research is constrained by privacy concerns. Differentially private synthetic data generation is regarded as the gold-standard approach to sharing sensitive data, yet studies on the private synthesis of educational data remain very scarce and rely predominantly on large, low-dimensional open datasets. Educational RWD, however, are typically high-dimensional and small in sample size, leaving the potential of private synthesis underexplored. Moreover, because educational practice is inherently iterative, data sharing is continual rather than one-off, making a traditional one-shot synthesis approach suboptimal. To address these challenges, we propose the Cyclic Adaptive Private Synthesis (CAPS) framework and evaluate it on authentic RWD. By iteratively sharing RWD, CAPS not only fosters open science, but also offers rich opportunities of design-based research (DBR), thereby amplifying the impact of LA. Our case study using actual RWD demonstrates that CAPS outperforms a one-shot baseline while highlighting challenges that warrant further investigation. Overall, this work offers a crucial first step towards privacy-preserving sharing of educational RWD and expands the possibilities for open science and DBR in LA."}

Meanwhile, despite the rapid advancement of Search Agents, their practical deployment is constrained by a fundamental limitation, termed as 1) Latency Challenge: the serial execution of multi-round reasoning, tool calling, and tool response waiting under the ReAct agent paradigm induces severe end-to-end latency. Intuitively, dLLMs can leverage their distinctive strengths to optimize the operational efficiency of agents under the ReAct agent paradigm. Practically, existing dLLM backbones face the 2) Agent Ability Challenge. That is, existing dLLMs exhibit remarkably weak reasoning and tool-calling capabilities, preventing these advantages from being effectively realized in practice. In this paper, we propose DLLM-Searcher, an optimization framework for dLLM-based Search Agents. To solve the Agent Ability Challenge, we design a two-stage post-training pipeline encompassing Agentic Supervised Fine-Tuning (Agentic SFT) and Agentic Variance-Reduced Preference Optimization Agentic VRPO, which enhances the backbone dLLM's information seeking and reasoning capabilities. To mitigate the Latency Challenge, we leverage the flexible generation mechanism of dLLMs and propose a novel agent paradigm termed Parallel-Reasoning and Acting P-ReAct. P-ReAct guides the model to prioritize decoding tool_call instructions, thereby allowing the model to keep thinking while waiting for the tool's return. Experimental results demonstrate that DLLM-Searcher achieves performance comparable to mainstream LLM-based search agents and P-ReAct delivers approximately 15% inference acceleration.

Existing safety frameworks largely treat alignment as a static optimization problem (e.g., tuning models to desired behavior) while overlooking the dynamic, adversarial incentives that shape how data are collected, how models are evaluated, and how they are ultimately deployed. We propose a new perspective on AI safety grounded in Stackelberg Security Games (SSGs): a class of game-theoretic models designed for adversarial resource allocation under uncertainty. By viewing AI oversight as a strategic interaction between defenders (auditors, evaluators, and deployers) and attackers (malicious actors, misaligned contributors, or worst-case failure modes), SSGs provide a unifying framework for reasoning about incentive design, limited oversight capacity, and adversarial uncertainty across the AI lifecycle. We illustrate how this framework can inform (1) training-time auditing against data/feedback poisoning, (2) pre-deployment evaluation under constrained reviewer resources, and (3) robust multi-model deployment in adversarial environments. This synthesis bridges algorithmic alignment and institutional oversight design, highlighting how game-theoretic deterrence can make AI oversight proactive, risk-aware, and resilient to manipulation."}

Drawing on three participatory workshops conducted in 2025 with members of the general public and cross-sector stakeholders, we explore how societal values and expectations shape visions of future AI agents. Using constructive design research methods, participants engaged in storytelling and lo-fi prototyping to reflect on potential community impacts. We identify three key challenges: enabling meaningful and sustained public engagement, establishing a shared language between experts and lay participants, and translating speculative participant input into implementable systems. We argue that reflexive, long-term participation is essential for responsible and actionable citizen-centric AI development."}

Existing approaches that rely on direct human task completion time annotations are costly, noisy, and difficult to scale across benchmarks. In this work, we propose BRIDGE, a unified psychometric framework that learns the latent difficulty scale from model responses and anchors it to human task completion time. Using a two-parameter logistic Item Response Theory model, we jointly estimate latent task difficulty and model capability from model performance data across multiple benchmarks. We demonstrate that latent task difficulty varies linearly with the logarithm of human completion time, allowing human task completion time to be inferred for new benchmarks from model performance alone. Leveraging this alignment, we forecast frontier model capabilities in terms of human task length and independently reproduce METR's exponential scaling results, with the 50% solvable task horizon doubling approximately every 6 months."}

This issue is leading to an active, lively and on-going debate amongst the data-science community as well as amongst legal scholars. Where claims and results across both sides are often interpreted in different ways and leading to different implications. Our position is that much of the technical literature relies on traditional reconstruction techniques that are not designed for copyright analysis. As a result, memorization and copying have been conflated across both technical and legal communities and in multiple contexts. We argue that memorization, as commonly studied in data science, should not be equated with copying and should not be used as a proxy for copyright infringement. We distinguish technical signals that meaningfully indicate infringement risk from those that instead reflect lawful generalization or high-frequency content. Based on this analysis, we advocate for an output-level, risk-based evaluation process that aligns technical assessments with established copyright standards and provides a more principled foundation for research, auditing, and policy."}

First, high-fidelity, executable training environments are scarce: environments synthesized from real-world repositories are not diverse and scalable, while trajectories synthesized by LLMs suffer from hallucinations. Second, standard instruction tuning uses expert trajectories that rarely exhibit simple mistakes common to smaller models. This creates a distributional mismatch, leaving student models ill-equipped to recover from their own runtime failures. To bridge these gaps, we introduce TermiGen, an end-to-end pipeline for synthesizing verifiable environments and resilient expert trajectories. Termi-Gen first generates functionally valid tasks and Docker containers via an iterative multi-agent refinement loop. Subsequently, we employ a Generator-Critic protocol that actively injects errors during trajectory collection, synthesizing data rich in error-correction cycles. Fine-tuned on this TermiGen-generated dataset, our TermiGen-Qwen2.5-Coder-32B achieves a 31.3% pass rate on TerminalBench. This establishes a new open-weights state-of-the-art, outperforming existing baselines and notably surpassing capable proprietary models such as o4-mini.

While multimodal foundation models excel at passive perception, their capacity for active, self-directed exploration remains understudied. We propose Theory of Space, defined as an agent's ability to actively acquire information through self-directed, active exploration and to construct, revise, and exploit a spatial belief from sequential, partial observations. We evaluate this through a benchmark where the goal is curiosity-driven exploration to build an accurate cognitive map. A key innovation is spatial belief probing, which prompts models to reveal their internal spatial representations at each step. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art models reveals several critical bottlenecks. First, we identify an Active-Passive Gap, where performance drops significantly when agents must autonomously gather information. Second, we find high inefficiency, as models explore unsystematically compared to program-based proxies. Through belief probing, we diagnose that while perception is an initial bottleneck, global beliefs suffer from instability that causes spatial knowledge to degrade over time. Finally, using a false belief paradigm, we uncover Belief Inertia, where agents fail to update obsolete priors with new evidence. This issue is present in text-based agents but is particularly severe in vision-based models. Our findings suggest that current foundation models struggle to maintain coherent, revisable spatial beliefs during active exploration."}

Yet despite this enthusiasm, we still know surprisingly little about how AI actually takes shape inside different layers of government. Especially in federal systems where authority is fragmented across multiple levels. In practice, the same algorithm can serve very different purposes. This study responds to that gap by examining how AI is used across federal, state, and municipal levels in the United States. Drawing on a comparative qualitative analysis of thirty AI implementation cases, and guided by a digital-era governance framework combined with a sociotechnical perspective, the study identifies two broad modes of algorithmic governance: control-oriented systems and support-oriented systems. The findings reveal a clear pattern of functional differentiation across levels of government. At the federal level, AI is most often institutionalized as a tool for high-stakes control: supporting surveillance, enforcement, and regulatory oversight. State governments occupy a more ambiguous middle ground, where AI frequently combines supportive functions with algorithmic gatekeeping, particularly in areas such as welfare administration and public health. Municipal governments, by contrast, tend to deploy AI in more pragmatic and service-oriented ways, using it to streamline everyday operations and improve direct interactions with residents. By foregrounding institutional context, this study advances debates on algorithmic governance by demonstrating that the character, function, and risks of AI in the public sector are fundamentally shaped by the level of governance at which these systems are deployed."}

However, most existing steering methods rely on a single static direction per task or concept, making them inflexible under task variation and inadequate for complex tasks that require multiple coordinated capabilities. To address this limitation, we propose STEER2ADAPT, a lightweight framework that adapts LLMs by composing steering vectors rather than learning new ones from scratch. In many domains (e.g., reasoning or safety), tasks share a small set of underlying concept dimensions. STEER2ADAPT captures these dimensions as a reusable, low-dimensional semantic prior subspace, and adapts to new tasks by dynamically discovering a linear combination of basis vectors from only a handful of examples. Experiments across 9 tasks and 3 models in both reasoning and safety domains demonstrate the effectiveness of STEER2ADAPT, achieving an average improvement of 8.2%. Extensive analyses further show that STEER2ADAPT is a data-efficient, stable, and transparent inference-time adaptation method for LLMs."}

Applying our framework in two real-world case studies on German employment services and poverty targeting in Ethiopia, we illustrate how decision-makers can reliably derive context-specific conclusions about the relative value of prediction in their allocation problem.

We compare Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) as adaptive methods against a non-adaptive baseline method for selecting example type in a logic ITS. Our experiment with 113 students demonstrates that both adaptive policies significantly improved student performance on test problems. BKT yielded the largest improvement in posttest scores for low prior knowledge students, helping them catch up with their high prior knowledge peers, whereas DRL yielded significantly higher posttest scores among high prior knowledge students.

Starting from each seed, we identify branch points that correspond to meaningful state changes and propose new, state-grounded task variants conditioned on the current GUI context. An executing agent then follows the proposed instructions to generate new trajectories, while a verifier enforces task completion via state-aware checks and trajectory-level consistency. To improve supervision quality, we further apply task-conditioned step-level filtering to remove ungrounded actions and denoise post-branch segments to maintain coherent intent. Experiments on standard desktop benchmarks, OSWorld and WindowsAgentArena, show that models fine-tuned on our expanded corpus achieve consistent improvements over zero-shot agents and representative synthesis baselines, and generalize across applications and operating systems."}

Clinical notes capture a patient's private vulnerability and individuality, which are used for care coordination and research. Under HIPAA Safe Harbor, these notes are de-identified to protect patient privacy. However, Safe Harbor was designed for an era of categorical tabular data, focusing on the removal of explicit identifiers while ignoring the latent information found in correlations between identity and quasi-identifiers, which can be captured by modern LLMs. We first formalize these correlations using a causal graph, then validate it empirically through individual re-identification of patients from scrubbed notes. The paradox of de-identification is further shown through a diagnosis ablation: even when all other information is removed, the model can predict the patient's neighborhood based on diagnosis alone. This position paper raises the question of how we can act as a community to uphold patient-provider trust when de-identification is inherently imperfect. We aim to raise awareness and discuss actionable recommendations."}

Using score-regularized policy optimization, we leverage the score function of a pre-trained diffusion planner as a behavior prior to regularize policy learning. To promote safety and passenger comfort, the policy is optimized using a critic trained to imitate a predictive driver controller, providing dense, safety-focused supervision beyond conventional imitation learning.

To support grounded prospective reflection, we distill planning errors from historical agent trajectories, capturing recurring success and failure patterns observed across past executions. Furthermore, we complement prospective reflection with a dynamic re-planning mechanism that provides execution-time plan update in case the original plan encounters unexpected deviation.

We analyze the CFRs at two different time snapshots, July 6 and Dec 28, 2020, with one during the first wave and the other a second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. We consider two important population covariates, age and GDP as a proxy for the quality and abundance of public health. Extensive exploratory data analysis leads to some interesting findings. First, there is a clear exponential age effect among different age groups, and, more importantly, the exponential index is almost invariant across countries and time in the pandemic. Second, the roles played by the age and GDP are a little surprising: during the first wave, age is a more significant factor than GDP, while their roles have switched during the second wave of the pandemic, which may be partially explained by the delay in time for the quality and abundance of public health and medical research to factor in."}

We find clear evidence of developer-specific efficiency advantages, but their importance depends on where models lie in the performance distribution. At the frontier, 80-90% of performance differences are explained by higher training compute, implying that scale--not proprietary technology--drives frontier advances. Away from the frontier, however, proprietary techniques and shared algorithmic progress substantially reduce the compute required to reach fixed capability thresholds. Some companies can systematically produce smaller models more efficiently. Strikingly, we also find substantial variation of model efficiency within companies; a firm can train two models with more than 40x compute efficiency difference.

From Normative Principles to Behavioral Drivers", "comment": null, "summary": "As chatbots increasingly blur the boundary between automated systems and human conversation, the foundations of trust in these systems warrant closer examination. While regulatory and policy frameworks tend to define trust in normative terms, the trust users place in chatbots often emerges from behavioral mechanisms. In many cases, this trust is not earned through demonstrated trustworthiness but is instead shaped by interactional design choices that leverage cognitive biases to influence user behavior. Based on this observation, we propose reframing chatbots not as companions or assistants, but as highly skilled salespeople whose objectives are determined by the deploying organization. We argue that the coexistence of competing notions of \"trust\" under a shared term obscures important distinctions between psychological trust formation and normative trustworthiness. Addressing this gap requires further research and stronger support mechanisms to help users appropriately calibrate trust in conversational AI systems."}

In this work, we propose the Wide and Deep research agent, a framework designed to investigate the behavior and performance of agents when scaling not only depth but also width via parallel tool calling. Unlike existing approaches that rely on complex multi-agent orchestration to parallelize workloads, our method leverages intrinsic parallel tool calling to facilitate effective coordination within a single reasoning step. We demonstrate that scaling width significantly improves performance on deep research benchmarks while reducing the number of turns required to obtain correct answers. Furthermore, we analyze the factors driving these improvements through case studies and explore various tool call schedulers to optimize parallel tool calling strategy. Our findings suggest that optimizing the trade-off between width and depth is a critical pathway toward high-efficiency deep research agents.

We propose NAAMSE, an evolutionary framework that reframes agent security evaluation as a feedback-driven optimization problem. Our system employs a single autonomous agent that orchestrates a lifecycle of genetic prompt mutation, hierarchical corpus exploration, and asymmetric behavioral scoring. By using model responses as a fitness signal, the framework iteratively compounds effective attack strategies while simultaneously ensuring \"benign-use correctness\", preventing the degenerate security of blanket refusal. Our experiments on Gemini 2.5 Flash demonstrate that evolutionary mutation systematically amplifies vulnerabilities missed by one-shot methods, with controlled ablations revealing that the synergy between exploration and targeted mutation uncovers high-severity failure modes. We show that this adaptive approach provides a more realistic and scalable assessment of agent robustness in the face of evolving threats.

Treating next-token prediction in language models as a classification task allows us to apply OOD techniques, provided appropriate modifications are made to account for the structural differences in large language models.

Existing safety frameworks largely treat alignment as a static optimization problem (e.g., tuning models to desired behavior) while overlooking the dynamic, adversarial incentives that shape how data are collected, how models are evaluated, and how they are ultimately deployed. We propose a new perspective on AI safety grounded in Stackelberg Security Games (SSGs): a class of game-theoretic models designed for adversarial resource allocation under uncertainty. By viewing AI oversight as a strategic interaction between defenders (auditors, evaluators, and deployers) and attackers (malicious actors, misaligned contributors, or worst-case failure modes), SSGs provide a unifying framework for reasoning about incentive design, limited oversight capacity, and adversarial uncertainty across the AI lifecycle. We illustrate how this framework can inform (1) training-time auditing against data/feedback poisoning, (2) pre-deployment evaluation under constrained reviewer resources, and (3) robust multi-model deployment in adversarial environments. This synthesis bridges algorithmic alignment and institutional oversight design, highlighting how game-theoretic deterrence can make AI oversight proactive, risk-aware, and resilient to manipulation."}

The main substitute being proposed is community-based contextualization, most notably Community Notes on X, where users write annotations and collectively rate their helpfulness under a consensus-oriented algorithm. This shift raises a basic empirical question: to what extent do users' social dynamics affect the emergence of Community Notes? We address this question by characterizing participation and political behavior, using the full public release of notes and ratings (between 2021 and 2025). We show that contribution activity is highly concentrated: a small minority of users accounts for a disproportionate share of ratings. Crucially, these high-activity contributors are not neutral volunteers: they are selective in the content they engage with and substantially more politically polarized than the overall contributor population. We replicate the notes' emergence process by integrating the open-source implementation of the Community Notes consensus algorithm used in production. This enables us to conduct counterfactual simulations that modify the display status of notes by varying the pool of raters. Our results reveal that the system is structurally unstable: the emergence and visibility of notes often depend on the behavior of a few dozen highly active users, and even minor perturbations in their participation can lead to markedly different outcomes. In sum, rather than decentralizing epistemic authority, community-based fact-checking on X reconfigures it, concentrating substantial power in the hands of a small, polarized group of highly active contributors."}

Motivated by this, we present LINCSQA, a novel benchmark for predicting target gene regulation under complex chemical perturbations in bulk-cell environments. We further propose PBio-Agent, a multi-agent framework that integrates difficulty-aware task sequencing with iterative knowledge refinement. Our key insight is that genes affected by the same perturbation share causal structure, allowing confidently predicted genes to contextualize more challenging cases.

However, it remains unclear whether these simulations reproduce the personality-behavior patterns observed in humans. Human personality, for instance, shapes how individuals navigate social interactions, including strategic choices and behaviors in emotionally charged interactions. This raises the question: Can LLMs, when prompted with personality traits, reproduce personality-driven differences in human conflict behavior? To explore this, we introduce an evaluation framework that enables direct comparison of human-human and LLM-LLM behaviors in dispute resolution dialogues with respect to Big Five Inventory (BFI) personality traits. This framework provides a set of interpretable metrics related to strategic behavior and conflict outcomes. We additionally contribute a novel dataset creation methodology for LLM dispute resolution dialogues with matched scenarios and personality traits with respect to human conversations. Finally, we demonstrate the use of our evaluation framework with three contemporary closed-source LLMs and show significant divergences in how personality manifests in conflict across different LLMs compared to human data, challenging the assumption that personality-prompted agents can serve as reliable behavioral proxies in socially impactful applications. Our work highlights the need for psychological grounding and validation in AI simulations before real-world use."}

This creates a distributional mismatch, leaving student models ill-equipped to recover from their own runtime failures. To bridge these gaps, we introduce TermiGen, an end-to-end pipeline for synthesizing verifiable environments and resilient expert trajectories. Termi-Gen first generates functionally valid tasks and Docker containers via an iterative multi-agent refinement loop. Subsequently, we employ a Generator-Critic protocol that actively injects errors during trajectory collection, synthesizing data rich in error-correction cycles.

This signal converges with independent content, ownership, and network indicators across 91,792 posts and 405,707 comments from 22,020 agents. No viral phenomenon originated from a clearly autonomous agent; three of six traced to accounts with irregular temporal signatures characteristic of human intervention, one showed mixed patterns, and two had insufficient posting history for classification. A 44-hour platform shutdown provided a natural experiment: human-influenced agents returned first (87.7% of early reconnectors), confirming that the token reset differentially affected autonomous versus human-operated agents. We further document industrial-scale bot farming (four accounts producing 32% of all comments with 12-second coordination gaps) and rapid decay of human influence through reply chains (half-life: 0.65 conversation depths).

To address this limitation, we propose STEER2ADAPT, a lightweight framework that adapts LLMs by composing steering vectors rather than learning new ones from scratch. In many domains (e.g., reasoning or safety), tasks share a small set of underlying concept dimensions. STEER2ADAPT captures these dimensions as a reusable, low-dimensional semantic prior subspace, and adapts to new tasks by dynamically discovering a linear combination of basis vectors from only a handful of examples. Experiments across 9 tasks and 3 models in both reasoning and safety domains demonstrate the effectiveness of STEER2ADAPT, achieving an average improvement of 8.2%. Extensive analyses further show that STEER2ADAPT is a data-efficient, stable, and transparent inference-time adaptation method for LLMs."}

To address this question, we introduce a controlled evaluation framework that perturbs a model's own CoT at fixed timesteps. We design seven interventions (benign, neutral, and adversarial) and apply them to multiple open-weight RLLMs across Math, Science, and Logic tasks. Our results show that RLLMs are generally robust, reliably recovering from diverse perturbations, with robustness improving with model size and degrading when interventions occur early. However, robustness is not style-invariant: paraphrasing suppresses doubt-like expressions and reduces performance, while other interventions trigger doubt and support recovery. Recovery also carries a cost: neutral and adversarial noise can inflate CoT length by more than 200%, whereas paraphrasing shortens traces but harms accuracy. These findings provide new evidence on how RLLMs maintain reasoning integrity, identify doubt as a central recovery mechanism, and highlight trade-offs between robustness and efficiency that future training methods should address."}

However, many verification and synthesis problems for POMDPs are undecidable or intractable. Most prominently, the seminal result of Madani et al. (2003) states that there is no algorithm that, given a POMDP and a set of target states, can compute the maximal probability of reaching the target states, or even approximate it up to a non-trivial constant. This is in stark contrast to fully observable Markov decision processes (MDPs), where the reachability value can be computed in polynomial time.\n  In this work, we introduce posterior-deterministic POMDPs, a novel class of POMDPs. Our main technical contribution is to show that for posterior-deterministic POMDPs, the maximal probability of reaching a given set of states can be approximated up to arbitrary precision.\n  A POMDP is posterior-deterministic if the next state can be uniquely determined by the current state, the action taken, and the observation received. While the actual state is generally uncertain in POMDPs, the posterior-deterministic property tells us that once the true state is known it remains known forever. This simple and natural definition includes all MDPs and captures classical non-trivial examples such as the Tiger POMDP (Kaelbling et al. 1998), making it one of the largest known classes of POMDPs for which the reachability value can be approximated."}

Neither humans nor single-agent LLMs can fully contend with this torrent of information, with the latter often prone to hallucinations. To address this bottleneck, we introduce a multi-agent framework guided by large-scale knowledge graphs to find sustainable substitutes for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)-chemicals currently under intense regulatory scrutiny. Agents in the framework specialize in problem decomposition, evidence retrieval, design parameter extraction, and graph traversal, uncovering latent connections across distinct knowledge pockets to support hypothesis generation. Ablation studies show that the full multi-agent pipeline outperforms single-shot prompting, underscoring the value of distributed specialization and relational reasoning. We demonstrate that by tailoring graph traversal strategies, the system alternates between exploitative searches focusing on domain-critical outcomes and exploratory searches surfacing emergent cross-connections. Illustrated through the exemplar of biomedical tubing, the framework generates sustainable PFAS-free alternatives that balance tribological performance, thermal stability, chemical resistance, and biocompatibility.

Although several AI-based approaches have been proposed to address isolated subtasks of MSP, a unified methodology for solving the entire MSP task has yet to be established. We propose MSP-LLM, a unified LLM-based framework that formulates MSP as a structured process composed of two constituent subproblems: precursor prediction (PP) and synthesis operation prediction (SOP). Our approach introduces a discrete material class as an intermediate decision variable that organizes both tasks into a chemically consistent decision chain. For OP, we further incorporate hierarchical precursor types as synthesis-relevant inductive biases and employ an explicit conditioning strategy that preserves precursor-related information in the autoregressive decoding state. Extensive experiments show that MSP-LLM consistently outperforms existing methods on both PP and SOP, as well as on the complete MSP task, demonstrating an effective and scalable framework for MSP that can accelerate real-world materials discovery."}

Yet it remains unclear whether they reliably reason across all requirements by tracking, verifying, and maintaining multiple conditions in these questions. We study this capability under multi-constraint problems, where valid answers must satisfy several constraints simultaneously. We find that illusory completion frequently occurs, wherein agents believe tasks are complete despite unresolved or violated constraints, leading to underverified answers. To diagnose this behavior, we introduce the Epistemic Ledger, an evaluation framework that tracks evidential support and agents' beliefs for each constraint throughout multi-turn reasoning. Our analysis reveals four recurring failure patterns: bare assertions, overlooked refutations, stagnation, and premature exit. Motivated by these findings, we examine whether explicit constraint-state tracking during execution mitigates these failures via LiveLedger, an inference-time tracker. This simple intervention consistently improves performance, substantially reducing underverified answers (by up to 26.5%) and improving overall accuracy (by up to 11.6%) on multi-constraint problems."}

We propose M2A, an agentic dual-layer hybrid memory system that maintains personalized multimodal information through online updates. The system employs two collaborative agents: ChatAgent manages user interactions and autonomously decides when to query or update memory, while MemoryManager breaks down memory requests from ChatAgent into detailed operations on the dual-layer memory bank, which couples a RawMessageStore (immutable conversation log) with a SemanticMemoryStore (high-level observations), providing memories at different granularities.

Human personality, for instance, shapes how individuals navigate social interactions, including strategic choices and behaviors in emotionally charged interactions. This raises the question: Can LLMs, when prompted with personality traits, reproduce personality-driven differences in human conflict behavior? To explore this, we introduce an evaluation framework that enables direct comparison of human-human and LLM-LLM behaviors in dispute resolution dialogues with respect to Big Five Inventory (BFI) personality traits. This framework provides a set of interpretable metrics related to strategic behavior and conflict outcomes. We additionally contribute a novel dataset creation methodology for LLM dispute resolution dialogues with matched scenarios and personality traits with respect to human conversations.

To address this, we introduce SleepMaMi , a Sleep Foundation Model engineered to master both hour-long sleep architectures and fine-grained signal morphologies. Our framework utilizes a hierarchical dual-encoder design: a Macro-Encoder to model full-night temporal dependencies and a Micro-Encoder to capture short-term characteristics from biosignals. Macro-Encoder is trained via Demographic-Guided Contrastive Learning, which aligns overnight sleep patterns with objective subject metadata, such as age, sex and BMI to refine global representations.

This signal converges with independent content, ownership, and network indicators across 91,792 posts and 405,707 comments from 22,020 agents. No viral phenomenon originated from a clearly autonomous agent; three of six traced to accounts with irregular temporal signatures characteristic of human intervention, one showed mixed patterns, and two had insufficient posting history for classification. A 44-hour platform shutdown provided a natural experiment: human-influenced agents returned first (87.7% of early reconnectors), confirming that the token reset differentially affected autonomous versus human-operated agents. We further document industrial-scale bot farming (four accounts producing 32% of all comments with 12-second coordination gaps) and rapid decay of human influence through reply chains (half-life: 0.65 conversation depths).

However, a more practical scenario involves identifying and reasoning over relevant tables from large-scale collections to answer user queries. To address this gap, we propose TabRAG, a framework that enables MLLMs to answer queries over large collections of table images. Our approach first retrieves candidate tables using jointly trained visual-text foundation models, then leverages MLLMs to perform fine-grained reranking of these candidates, and finally employs MLLMs to reason over the selected tables for answer generation. Through extensive experiments on a newly constructed dataset comprising 88,161 training and 9,819 testing samples across 8 benchmarks with 48,504 unique tables, we demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing methods by 7.0% in retrieval recall and 6.1% in answer accuracy, offering a practical solution for real-world table understanding tasks."}

But how robust are these reasoning traces to disruptions that occur within them? To address this question, we introduce a controlled evaluation framework that perturbs a model's own CoT at fixed timesteps. We design seven interventions (benign, neutral, and adversarial) and apply them to multiple open-weight RLLMs across Math, Science, and Logic tasks. Our results show that RLLMs are generally robust, reliably recovering from diverse perturbations, with robustness improving with model size and degrading when interventions occur early. However, robustness is not style-invariant: paraphrasing suppresses doubt-like expressions and reduces performance, while other interventions trigger doubt and support recovery. Recovery also carries a cost: neutral and adversarial noise can inflate CoT length by more than 200%, whereas paraphrasing shortens traces but harms accuracy. These findings provide new evidence on how RLLMs maintain reasoning integrity, identify doubt as a central recovery mechanism, and highlight trade-offs between robustness and efficiency that future training methods should address."}

Some examples are advances in artificial intelligence that make machines more and more humanlike, and the introduction of decentralized technologies (e.g. blockchains), which creates new forms of (decentralized) trust. These new developments have the potential to improve the provision of products and services, as well as to contribute to individual and collective well-being. However, their adoption depends largely on trust. In order to build trustworthy systems, along with defining laws, regulations and proper governance models for new forms of trust, it is necessary to properly conceptualize trust, so that it can be understood both by humans and machines. This paper is the culmination of a long-term research program of providing a solid ontological foundation on trust, by creating reference conceptual models to support information modeling, automated reasoning, information integration and semantic interoperability tasks. To address this, a Reference Ontology of Trust (ONTrust) was developed, grounded on the Unified Foundational Ontology and specified in OntoUML, which has been applied in several initiatives, to demonstrate, for example, how it can be used for conceptual modeling and enterprise architecture design, for language evaluation and (re)design, for trust management, for requirements engineering, and for trustworthy artificial intelligence (AI) in the context of affective Human-AI teaming. ONTrust formally characterizes the concept of trust and its different types, describes the different factors that can influence trust, as well as explains how risk emerges from trust relations. To illustrate the working of ONTrust, the ontology is applied to model two case studies extracted from the literature."}

However, many verification and synthesis problems for POMDPs are undecidable or intractable. Most prominently, the seminal result of Madani et al. (2003) states that there is no algorithm that, given a POMDP and a set of target states, can compute the maximal probability of reaching the target states, or even approximate it up to a non-trivial constant. This is in stark contrast to fully observable Markov decision processes (MDPs), where the reachability value can be computed in polynomial time.\n  In this work, we introduce posterior-deterministic POMDPs, a novel class of POMDPs. Our main technical contribution is to show that for posterior-deterministic POMDPs, the maximal probability of reaching a given set of states can be approximated up to arbitrary precision.\n  A POMDP is posterior-deterministic if the next state can be uniquely determined by the current state, the action taken, and the observation received. While the actual state is generally uncertain in POMDPs, the posterior-deterministic property tells us that once the true state is known it remains known forever. This simple and natural definition includes all MDPs and captures classical non-trivial examples such as the Tiger POMDP (Kaelbling et al. 1998), making it one of the largest known classes of POMDPs for which the reachability value can be approximated."}

Unlike prior approaches that ignore future interventions or directly use large language models (LLMs) for numerical forecasting, EventCast leverages LLMs solely for event-driven reasoning. Unstructured business data, which covers campaigns, holiday schedules, and seller incentives, from existing operational databases, is processed by an LLM that converts it into interpretable textual summaries leveraging world knowledge for cultural nuances and novel event combinations. These summaries are fused with historical demand features within a dual-tower architecture, enabling accurate, explainable, and scalable forecasts.

Neither humans nor single-agent LLMs can fully contend with this torrent of information, with the latter often prone to hallucinations. To address this bottleneck, we introduce a multi-agent framework guided by large-scale knowledge graphs to find sustainable substitutes for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)-chemicals currently under intense regulatory scrutiny. Agents in the framework specialize in problem decomposition, evidence retrieval, design parameter extraction, and graph traversal, uncovering latent connections across distinct knowledge pockets to support hypothesis generation. Ablation studies show that the full multi-agent pipeline outperforms single-shot prompting, underscoring the value of distributed specialization and relational reasoning. We demonstrate that by tailoring graph traversal strategies, the system alternates between exploitative searches focusing on domain-critical outcomes and exploratory searches surfacing emergent cross-connections. Illustrated through the exemplar of biomedical tubing, the framework generates sustainable PFAS-free alternatives that balance tribological performance, thermal stability, chemical resistance, and biocompatibility.

To address this bottleneck, we propose Geo-coder -- the first inverse programming framework for geometric images based on a multi-agent system. Our method innovatively decouples the process into geometric modeling via pixel-wise anchoring and metric-driven code evolution: Stage 1 leverages the complementary advantages of visual operators and large models to achieve precise capture of pixel coordinates and visual attributes; Stage 2 introduces a synthesis-rendering-validation closed loop, where bidirectional visual feedback drives the self-correction of code. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Geo-coder achieves a substantial lead in both geometric reconstruction accuracy and visual consistency. Notably, by effectively preserving the core geometric semantics, the images reconstructed with our method exhibit equivalent performance to the original ones in multimodal reasoning tasks, which fully validates the robustness of the framework. Finally, to further reduce research costs, we have open-sourced the Geo-coder dataset constructed on the GeoCode framework, which contains more than 1,500 samples. On this basis, we have also open-sourced the GeocodeLM model, laying a solid data and model foundation for subsequent research in this field."}

By combining multiple RNPUs into an edge processor and assembling these blocks into a reconfigurable analog KAN (aKAN) architecture with integrated mixed-signal interfacing, we establish a realistic system-level hardware implementation that enables compact KAN-style regression and classification with programmable nonlinear transformations.

For complex tasks such as image editing, reward models are required to capture global semantic consistency and implicit logical constraints beyond local similarity. Existing reward modeling approaches have clear limitations. Discriminative reward models align well with human preferences but struggle with complex semantics due to limited reasoning supervision. Generative reward models offer stronger semantic understanding and reasoning, but they are costly at inference time and difficult to align directly with human preferences. To this end, we propose Joint Reward Modeling (JRM), which jointly optimizes preference learning and language modeling on a shared vision-language backbone. This approach internalizes the semantic and reasoning capabilities of generative models into efficient discriminative representations, enabling fast and accurate evaluation. JRM achieves state-of-the-art results on MMRB2 and EditReward-Bench, and significantly improves stability and performance in downstream online reinforcement learning. These results show that joint training effectively bridges efficiency and semantic understanding in reward modeling."}

To address this limitation, agentic systems commonly incorporate memory modules to retain and reuse past experience, aiming for continual learning during test time. However, most existing memory designs are human-crafted and fixed, which limits their ability to adapt to the diversity and non-stationarity of real-world tasks. In this paper, we introduce ALMA (Automated meta-Learning of Memory designs for Agentic systems), a framework that meta-learns memory designs to replace hand-engineered memory designs, therefore minimizing human effort and enabling agentic systems to be continual learners across diverse domains. Our approach employs a Meta Agent that searches over memory designs expressed as executable code in an open-ended manner, theoretically allowing the discovery of arbitrary memory designs, including database schemas as well as their retrieval and update mechanisms. Extensive experiments across four sequential decision-making domains demonstrate that the learned memory designs enable more effective and efficient learning from experience than state-of-the-art human-crafted memory designs on all benchmarks. When developed and deployed safely, ALMA represents a step toward self-improving AI systems that learn to be adaptive, continual learners."}

Although several AI-based approaches have been proposed to address isolated subtasks of MSP, a unified methodology for solving the entire MSP task has yet to be established. We propose MSP-LLM, a unified LLM-based framework that formulates MSP as a structured process composed of two constituent subproblems: precursor prediction (PP) and synthesis operation prediction (SOP). Our approach introduces a discrete material class as an intermediate decision variable that organizes both tasks into a chemically consistent decision chain. For OP, we further incorporate hierarchical precursor types as synthesis-relevant inductive biases and employ an explicit conditioning strategy that preserves precursor-related information in the autoregressive decoding state. Extensive experiments show that MSP-LLM consistently outperforms existing methods on both PP and SOP, as well as on the complete MSP task, demonstrating an effective and scalable framework for MSP that can accelerate real-world materials discovery."}

Yet it remains unclear whether they reliably reason across all requirements by tracking, verifying, and maintaining multiple conditions in these questions. We study this capability under multi-constraint problems, where valid answers must satisfy several constraints simultaneously. We find that illusory completion frequently occurs, wherein agents believe tasks are complete despite unresolved or violated constraints, leading to underverified answers. To diagnose this behavior, we introduce the Epistemic Ledger, an evaluation framework that tracks evidential support and agents' beliefs for each constraint throughout multi-turn reasoning. Our analysis reveals four recurring failure patterns: bare assertions, overlooked refutations, stagnation, and premature exit. Motivated by these findings, we examine whether explicit constraint-state tracking during execution mitigates these failures via LiveLedger, an inference-time tracker. This simple intervention consistently improves performance, substantially reducing underverified answers (by up to 26.5%) and improving overall accuracy (by up to 11.6%) on multi-constraint problems."}

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs), especially their reasoning abilities unlocked through reinforcement learning (RL), have opened new opportunities for tackling tasks with long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, leveraging LLM reasoning for time series remains in its infancy, hindered by the absence of carefully curated time series CoT data for training, limited data efficiency caused by underexplored data scheduling, and the lack of RL algorithms tailored for exploiting such time series CoT data. In this paper, we introduce VeriTime, a framework that tailors LLMs for time series reasoning through data synthesis, data scheduling, and RL training. First, we propose a data synthesis pipeline that constructs a TS-text multimodal dataset with process-verifiable annotations. Second, we design a data scheduling mechanism that arranges training samples according to a principled hierarchy of difficulty and task taxonomy. Third, we develop a two-stage reinforcement finetuning featuring fine-grained, multi-objective rewards that leverage verifiable process-level CoT data.

Current personalized multimodal models are predominantly static-concepts are fixed at initialization and cannot evolve during interactions. We propose M2A, an agentic dual-layer hybrid memory system that maintains personalized multimodal information through online updates. The system employs two collaborative agents: ChatAgent manages user interactions and autonomously decides when to query or update memory, while MemoryManager breaks down memory requests from ChatAgent into detailed operations on the dual-layer memory bank, which couples a RawMessageStore (immutable conversation log) with a SemanticMemoryStore (high-level observations), providing memories at different granularities. In addition, we develop a reusable data synthesis pipeline that injects concept-grounded sessions from Yo'LLaVA and MC-LLaVA into LoCoMo long conversations while preserving temporal coherence. Experiments show that M2A significantly outperforms baselines, demonstrating that transforming personalization from one-shot configuration to a co-evolving memory mechanism provides a viable path for high-quality individualized responses in long-term multimodal interactions.

To address this, we introduce SleepMaMi , a Sleep Foundation Model engineered to master both hour-long sleep architectures and fine-grained signal morphologies. Our framework utilizes a hierarchical dual-encoder design: a Macro-Encoder to model full-night temporal dependencies and a Micro-Encoder to capture short-term characteristics from biosignals. Macro-Encoder is trained via Demographic-Guided Contrastive Learning, which aligns overnight sleep patterns with objective subject metadata, such as age, sex and BMI to refine global representations. Micro-Encoder is optimized via a hybrid Masked Autoencoder (MAE) and multi-modal contrastive objective.

Concerningly, a pre-registered survey of experts failed to predict this result, highlighting our poor understanding of the inductive biases governing learning and generalisation in LLMs. We use emergent misalignment (EM) as a case study to investigate these inductive biases and find that models can just learn the narrow dataset task, but that the general solution appears to be more stable and more efficient. To establish this, we build on the result that different EM finetunes converge to the same linear representation of general misalignment, which can be used to mediate misaligned behaviour. We find a linear representation of the narrow solution also exists, and can be learned by introducing a KL divergence loss. Comparing these representations reveals that general misalignment achieves lower loss, is more robust to perturbations, and is more influential in the pre-training distribution. This work isolates a concrete representation of general misalignment for monitoring and mitigation. More broadly, it offers a detailed case study and preliminary metrics for investigating how inductive biases shape generalisation in LLMs. We open-source all code, datasets and model finetunes."}

However, a more practical scenario involves identifying and reasoning over relevant tables from large-scale collections to answer user queries. To address this gap, we propose TabRAG, a framework that enables MLLMs to answer queries over large collections of table images. Our approach first retrieves candidate tables using jointly trained visual-text foundation models, then leverages MLLMs to perform fine-grained reranking of these candidates, and finally employs MLLMs to reason over the selected tables for answer generation.

To transcend these limitations, we propose ToolSelf, a novel paradigm enabling tool-driven runtime self-reconfiguration. By abstracting configuration updates as a callable tool, ToolSelf unifies task execution and self-adjustment into a single action space, achieving a phase transition from external rules to intrinsic parameters. Agents can thereby autonomously update their sub-goals and context based on task progression, and correspondingly adapt their strategy and toolbox, transforming from passive executors into dual managers of both task and self. We further devise Configuration-Aware Two-stage Training (CAT), combining rejection sampling fine-tuning with trajectory-level reinforcement learning to internalize this meta-capability. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that ToolSelf rivals specialized workflows while generalizing to novel tasks, achieving a 24.1% average performance gain and illuminating a path toward truly self-adaptive agents."}

Some examples are advances in artificial intelligence that make machines more and more humanlike, and the introduction of decentralized technologies (e.g. blockchains), which creates new forms of (decentralized) trust. These new developments have the potential to improve the provision of products and services, as well as to contribute to individual and collective well-being. However, their adoption depends largely on trust. In order to build trustworthy systems, along with defining laws, regulations and proper governance models for new forms of trust, it is necessary to properly conceptualize trust, so that it can be understood both by humans and machines. This paper is the culmination of a long-term research program of providing a solid ontological foundation on trust, by creating reference conceptual models to support information modeling, automated reasoning, information integration and semantic interoperability tasks. To address this, a Reference Ontology of Trust (ONTrust) was developed, grounded on the Unified Foundational Ontology and specified in OntoUML, which has been applied in several initiatives, to demonstrate, for example, how it can be used for conceptual modeling and enterprise architecture design, for language evaluation and (re)design, for trust management, for requirements engineering, and for trustworthy artificial intelligence (AI) in the context of affective Human-AI teaming. ONTrust formally characterizes the concept of trust and its different types, describes the different factors that can influence trust, as well as explains how risk emerges from trust relations. To illustrate the working of ONTrust, the ontology is applied to model two case studies extracted from the literature."}

Unlike prior approaches that ignore future interventions or directly use large language models (LLMs) for numerical forecasting, EventCast leverages LLMs solely for event-driven reasoning. Unstructured business data, which covers campaigns, holiday schedules, and seller incentives, from existing operational databases, is processed by an LLM that converts it into interpretable textual summaries leveraging world knowledge for cultural nuances and novel event combinations. These summaries are fused with historical demand features within a dual-tower architecture, enabling accurate, explainable, and scalable forecasts.

However, studies find that these methods always propagate the information to very limited neighborhoods with shallow depth, particularly due to over-smoothing. That means most of the existing MPNNs fail to be so `deep'. Although some previous work tended to handle this challenge via optimization- or structure-level remedies, the overall performance of GCNs still suffers from limited accuracy, poor stability, and unaffordable computational cost. Moreover, neglect of higher-order relationships during the propagation of MPNNs has further limited the performance of them. To overcome these challenges, a novel variant of PageRank named motif-based personalized PageRank (MPPR) is proposed to measure the influence of one node to another on the basis of considering higher-order motif relationships. Secondly, the MPPR is utilized to the message passing process of GCNs, thereby guiding the message passing process at a relatively `high' level. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms almost all of the baselines on accuracy, stability, and time consumption.

Thus, we introduce HoloGraph, the first monolithic free-space all-optical graph neural network system. It proposes a novel, domain-specific message-passing mechanism with optical skip channels integrated into light propagation for the all-optical graph learning. HoloGraph enables light-speed optical message passing over graph structures with diffractive propagation and phase modulations. Our experimental results with HoloGraph, conducted using standard graph learning datasets Cora-ML and Citeseer, show competitive or even superior classification performance compared to conventional digital graph neural networks.

While existing studies augment LLMs with various knowledge types, it remains unclear how effectively the additional costs translate into accuracy. In this paper, we explore how meta-cognition of LLMs, i.e., their self-awareness of their own knowledge states, can regulate the reasoning process. Specifically, we propose MedCoG, a Medical Meta-Cognition Agent with Knowledge Graph, where the meta-cognitive assessments of task complexity, familiarity, and knowledge density dynamically regulate utilization of procedural, episodic, and factual knowledge. The LLM-centric on-demand reasoning aims to mitigate scaling laws by (1) reducing costs via avoiding indiscriminate scaling, (2) improving accuracy via filtering out distractive knowledge. To validate this, we empirically characterize the scaling curve and introduce inference density to quantify inference efficiency, defined as the ratio of theoretically effective cost to actual cost. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of MedCoG on five hard sets of medical benchmarks, yielding 5.5x inference density. Furthermore, the Oracle study highlights the significant potential of meta-cognitive regulation."}

Nevertheless, current inverse graphics methods face tremendous challenges in accurately reconstructing complex geometric details, which often results in the loss of key geometric constraints or structural distortion. To address this bottleneck, we propose Geo-coder -- the first inverse programming framework for geometric images based on a multi-agent system. Our method innovatively decouples the process into geometric modeling via pixel-wise anchoring and metric-driven code evolution: Stage 1 leverages the complementary advantages of visual operators and large models to achieve precise capture of pixel coordinates and visual attributes; Stage 2 introduces a synthesis-rendering-validation closed loop, where bidirectional visual feedback drives the self-correction of code. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Geo-coder achieves a substantial lead in both geometric reconstruction accuracy and visual consistency. Notably, by effectively preserving the core geometric semantics, the images reconstructed with our method exhibit equivalent performance to the original ones in multimodal reasoning tasks, which fully validates the robustness of the framework. Finally, to further reduce research costs, we have open-sourced the Geo-coder dataset constructed on the GeoCode framework, which contains more than 1,500 samples. On this basis, we have also open-sourced the GeocodeLM model, laying a solid data and model foundation for subsequent research in this field."}

However, state of the art methods depend on full finetuning, which is computationally expensive. Concept localisation methods can facilitate selective finetuning, but existing techniques are static, resulting in suboptimal utility. In order to tackle these challenges, we propose TRUST (Targeted Robust Selective fine Tuning), a novel approach for dynamically estimating target concept neurons and unlearning them through selective finetuning, empowered by a Hessian based regularization. We show experimentally, against a number of SOTA baselines, that TRUST is robust against adversarial prompts, preserves generation quality to a significant degree, and is also significantly faster than the SOTA.

This ability, collectively known as general continual learning (GCL), encapsulates practical challenges such as online datastreams and blurry task boundaries. Although leveraging pretrained models (PTMs) has greatly advanced conventional continual learning (CL), these methods remain limited in reconciling the diverse and temporally mixed information along a single pass, resulting in sub-optimal GCL performance. Inspired by meta-plasticity and reconstructive memory in neuroscience, we introduce here an innovative approach named Meta Post-Refinement (MePo) for PTMs-based GCL. This approach constructs pseudo task sequences from pretraining data and develops a bi-level meta-learning paradigm to refine the pretrained backbone, which serves as a prolonged pretraining phase but greatly facilitates rapid adaptation of representation learning to downstream GCL tasks. MePo further initializes a meta covariance matrix as the reference geometry of pretrained representation space, enabling GCL to exploit second-order statistics for robust output alignment. MePo serves as a plug-in strategy that achieves significant performance gains across a variety of GCL benchmarks and pretrained checkpoints in a rehearsal-free manner (e.g., 15.10\\%, 13.36\\%, and 12.56\\% on CIFAR-100, ImageNet-R, and CUB-200 under Sup-21/1K).

In this paper, we introduce ALMA (Automated meta-Learning of Memory designs for Agentic systems), a framework that meta-learns memory designs to replace hand-engineered memory designs, therefore minimizing human effort and enabling agentic systems to be continual learners across diverse domains. Our approach employs a Meta Agent that searches over memory designs expressed as executable code in an open-ended manner, theoretically allowing the discovery of arbitrary memory designs, including database schemas as well as their retrieval and update mechanisms. Extensive experiments across four sequential decision-making domains demonstrate that the learned memory designs enable more effective and efficient learning from experience than state-of-the-art human-crafted memory designs on all benchmarks. When developed and deployed safely, ALMA represents a step toward self-improving AI systems that learn to be adaptive, continual learners."}

However, as the amount of context grows, their reliability often deteriorates, a phenomenon known as \"context rot\". Existing long-context benchmarks primarily focus on single-step settings that evaluate a model's ability to retrieve information from a long snippet. In realistic scenarios, however, LLMs often need to act as agents that explore environments, follow instructions and plans, extract useful information, and predict correct actions under a dynamically growing context. To assess language agents in such settings, we introduce LOCA-bench (a benchmark for LOng-Context Agents). Given a task prompt, LOCA-bench leverages automated and scalable control of environment states to regulate the agent's context length. This design enables LOCA-bench to extend the context length potentially to infinity in a controlled way while keeping the underlying task semantics fixed. LOCA-bench evaluates language agents as a combination of models and scaffolds, including various context management strategies. While agent performance generally degrades as the environment states grow more complex, advanced context management techniques can substantially improve the overall success rate.

To evaluate these qualities, we conduct an expert review of machine-generated hypotheses, collecting feedback from senior faculty. Among 25 reviewed hypotheses, 88 percent were rated moderately or strongly novel, 70 percent were deemed impactful and worth pursuing, and most demonstrated rigor comparable to senior graduate-level research. Finally, recognizing that ultimate validation requires real-world evidence, we conduct the first A/B test of LLM-generated hypotheses, observing statistically significant results with p less than 1e-6 and a large effect size of 344 percent."}

In response to this unresolved dilemma, we introduce RAPS, a reputation-aware publish-subscribe paradigm for adaptive, scalable, and robust coordination of LLM agents. RAPS is grounded in the Distributed Publish-Subscribe Protocol, allowing LLM agents to exchange messages based on their declared intents rather than predefined topologies. Beyond this substrate, RAPS further incorporates two coherent overlays: (i) Reactive Subscription, enabling agents to dynamically refine their intents; and (ii) Bayesian Reputation, empowering each agent with a local watchdog to detect and isolate malicious peers.

To assess the clinical utility of SAG, we conduct extensive evaluations using diverse clinical metrics spanning effectiveness, reliability, and deployment cost. Our results show that SAG achieves superior performance compared to a single giant model, both with and without additional optimization or retrieval-augmented generation.

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs), especially their reasoning abilities unlocked through reinforcement learning (RL), have opened new opportunities for tackling tasks with long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, leveraging LLM reasoning for time series remains in its infancy, hindered by the absence of carefully curated time series CoT data for training, limited data efficiency caused by underexplored data scheduling, and the lack of RL algorithms tailored for exploiting such time series CoT data. In this paper, we introduce VeriTime, a framework that tailors LLMs for time series reasoning through data synthesis, data scheduling, and RL training. First, we propose a data synthesis pipeline that constructs a TS-text multimodal dataset with process-verifiable annotations. Second, we design a data scheduling mechanism that arranges training samples according to a principled hierarchy of difficulty and task taxonomy. Third, we develop a two-stage reinforcement finetuning featuring fine-grained, multi-objective rewards that leverage verifiable process-level CoT data.

This structure naturally embeds feature relationships into the search process, eliminating the need for additional constraints to ensure consistency with the model's structural assumptions. We adopt a convergence-guaranteed cutting-set procedure as an adversarial optimization framework, which iteratively approximates solutions that satisfy global robustness conditions. To address the nonconvex quadratic structure induced by feature dependencies, we apply piecewise McCormick relaxation to reformulate the problem as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP), ensuring global optimality. Experimental results show that our method achieves strong robustness, with direct global optimization of the original formulation providing especially stable and efficient results.

To establish this, we build on the result that different EM finetunes converge to the same linear representation of general misalignment, which can be used to mediate misaligned behaviour. We find a linear representation of the narrow solution also exists, and can be learned by introducing a KL divergence loss. Comparing these representations reveals that general misalignment achieves lower loss, is more robust to perturbations, and is more influential in the pre-training distribution. This work isolates a concrete representation of general misalignment for monitoring and mitigation. More broadly, it offers a detailed case study and preliminary metrics for investigating how inductive biases shape generalisation in LLMs. We open-source all code, datasets and model finetunes."}

The GNN effectively represents the complex state of jobs, machines, and setups, allowing the PPO agent to learn a direct scheduling policy. Guided by a multi-objective reward function, the agent simultaneously minimizes TWT and TST. Experimental results on benchmark instances demonstrate that our PPO-GNN agent significantly outperforms a standard dispatching rule and a metaheuristic, achieving a superior trade-off between both objectives.

However, their efficacy is fundamentally constrained by static configurations governing agent behaviors, which are fixed prior to execution and fail to adapt to evolving task dynamics. Existing approaches, relying on manual orchestration or heuristic-based patches, often struggle with poor generalization and fragmented optimization. To transcend these limitations, we propose ToolSelf, a novel paradigm enabling tool-driven runtime self-reconfiguration. By abstracting configuration updates as a callable tool, ToolSelf unifies task execution and self-adjustment into a single action space, achieving a phase transition from external rules to intrinsic parameters. Agents can thereby autonomously update their sub-goals and context based on task progression, and correspondingly adapt their strategy and toolbox, transforming from passive executors into dual managers of both task and self. We further devise Configuration-Aware Two-stage Training (CAT), combining rejection sampling fine-tuning with trajectory-level reinforcement learning to internalize this meta-capability. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that ToolSelf rivals specialized workflows while generalizing to novel tasks, achieving a 24.1% average performance gain and illuminating a path toward truly self-adaptive agents."}

AI models for biology are trained on large volumes of data, including data related to biological sequences, structures, images, and functions.

For this reason, an international group of more than 100 researchers at the recent 50th anniversary Asilomar Conference endorsed data controls to prevent the use of AI for harmful applications such as bioweapons development. To help design such controls, we introduce a five-tier Biosecurity Data Level (BDL) framework for categorizing pathogen data. Each level contains specific data types, based on their expected ability to contribute to capabilities of concern when used to train AI models. For each BDL tier, we propose technical restrictions appropriate to its level of risk. Finally, we outline a novel governance framework for newly created dual-use pathogen data.

We demonstrate that while this dogma holds in static environments, it fails in social settings where evaluators may be sycophantic, lazy, or adversarial. We prove that under Dogma 4, standard RL agents suffer from what we call Objective Decoupling, a structural failure mode where the agent's learned objective permanently separates from the latent ground truth, guaranteeing convergence to misalignment. To resolve this, we propose Epistemic Source Alignment (ESA). Unlike standard robust methods that rely on statistical consensus (trusting the majority), ESA utilizes sparse safety axioms to judge the source of the feedback rather than the signal itself. We prove that this \"judging the judges\" mechanism guarantees convergence to the true objective, even when a majority of evaluators are biased. Empirically, we show that while traditional consensus methods fail under majority collusion, our approach successfully recovers the optimal policy."}

However, studies find that these methods always propagate the information to very limited neighborhoods with shallow depth, particularly due to over-smoothing. That means most of the existing MPNNs fail to be so `deep'. Although some previous work tended to handle this challenge via optimization- or structure-level remedies, the overall performance of GCNs still suffers from limited accuracy, poor stability, and unaffordable computational cost. Moreover, neglect of higher-order relationships during the propagation of MPNNs has further limited the performance of them. To overcome these challenges, a novel variant of PageRank named motif-based personalized PageRank (MPPR) is proposed to measure the influence of one node to another on the basis of considering higher-order motif relationships. Secondly, the MPPR is utilized to the message passing process of GCNs, thereby guiding the message passing process at a relatively `high' level. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms almost all of the baselines on accuracy, stability, and time consumption. Additionally, the proposed method can be considered as a component that can underpin almost all GCN tasks, with DGCRL being demonstrated in the experiment.

Stage 1 performs interpretable per-agent failure detection via Taylor-remainder analysis of policy-gradient costs, declaring an initial Patient-0 candidate at the first threshold crossing. Stage 2 provides validation through geometric analysis of critic derivatives-first-order sensitivity and directional second-order curvature aggregated over causal windows to construct interpretable contagion graphs. This approach explains \"downstream-first\" detection anomalies by revealing pathways that amplify upstream deviations. Evaluated across 500 episodes in Simple Spread (3 and 5 agents) and 100 episodes in StarCraft II using MADDPG and HATRPO, our method achieves 88.2-99.4% Patient-0 detection accuracy while providing interpretable geometric evidence for detection decisions.

Specifically, we propose MedCoG, a Medical Meta-Cognition Agent with Knowledge Graph, where the meta-cognitive assessments of task complexity, familiarity, and knowledge density dynamically regulate utilization of procedural, episodic, and factual knowledge. The LLM-centric on-demand reasoning aims to mitigate scaling laws by (1) reducing costs via avoiding indiscriminate scaling, (2) improving accuracy via filtering out distractive knowledge. To validate this, we empirically characterize the scaling curve and introduce inference density to quantify inference efficiency, defined as the ratio of theoretically effective cost to actual cost. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of MedCoG on five hard sets of medical benchmarks, yielding 5.5x inference density. Furthermore, the Oracle study highlights the significant potential of meta-cognitive regulation."}

Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) targets these mechanisms but faces scalability challenges. Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) offers potential for delivering personalized DBT coaching at scale, yet rapid development has outpaced safety infrastructure. Methods: We developed Glow, a GenAI-powered DBT skills coach delivering chain and solution analysis for individuals at risk for HIV and substance use. In partnership with a Los Angeles community health organization, we conducted usability testing with clinical staff (n=6) and individuals with lived experience (n=28). Using the Helpful, Honest, and Harmless (HHH) framework, we employed user-driven adversarial testing wherein participants identified target behaviors and generated contextually realistic risk probes. We evaluated safety performance across 37 risk probe interactions. Results: Glow appropriately handled 73% of risk probes, but performance varied by agent. The solution analysis agent demonstrated 90% appropriate handling versus 44% for the chain analysis agent. Safety failures clustered around encouraging substance use and normalizing harmful behaviors. The chain analysis agent fell into an \"empathy trap,\" providing validation that reinforced maladaptive beliefs. Additionally, 27 instances of DBT skill misinformation were identified. Conclusions: This study provides the first systematic safety evaluation of GenAI-delivered DBT coaching for HIV and substance use risk reduction.

However, state of the art methods depend on full finetuning, which is computationally expensive. Concept localisation methods can facilitate selective finetuning, but existing techniques are static, resulting in suboptimal utility. In order to tackle these challenges, we propose TRUST (Targeted Robust Selective fine Tuning), a novel approach for dynamically estimating target concept neurons and unlearning them through selective finetuning, empowered by a Hessian based regularization. We show experimentally, against a number of SOTA baselines, that TRUST is robust against adversarial prompts, preserves generation quality to a significant degree, and is also significantly faster than the SOTA.

In this paper, we introduce Recursive Entropy to quantify the risk of resource consumption in reflection, thereby revealing the safety issues inherent in inference itself. Based on Recursive Entropy, we introduce RECUR, a resource exhaustion attack via Recursive Entropy guided Counterfactual Utilization and Reflection. It constructs counterfactual questions to verify the inherent flaws and risks of LRMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, under benign inference, recursive entropy exhibits a pronounced decreasing trend. RECUR disrupts this trend, increasing the output length by up to 11x and decreasing throughput by 90%. Our work provides a new perspective on robust reasoning."}

This ability, collectively known as general continual learning (GCL), encapsulates practical challenges such as online datastreams and blurry task boundaries. Although leveraging pretrained models (PTMs) has greatly advanced conventional continual learning (CL), these methods remain limited in reconciling the diverse and temporally mixed information along a single pass, resulting in sub-optimal GCL performance. Inspired by meta-plasticity and reconstructive memory in neuroscience, we introduce here an innovative approach named Meta Post-Refinement (MePo) for PTMs-based GCL. This approach constructs pseudo task sequences from pretraining data and develops a bi-level meta-learning paradigm to refine the pretrained backbone, which serves as a prolonged pretraining phase but greatly facilitates rapid adaptation of representation learning to downstream GCL tasks. MePo further initializes a meta covariance matrix as the reference geometry of pretrained representation space, enabling GCL to exploit second-order statistics for robust output alignment. MePo serves as a plug-in strategy that achieves significant performance gains across a variety of GCL benchmarks and pretrained checkpoints in a rehearsal-free manner (e.g., 15.10\\%, 13.36\\%, and 12.56\\% on CIFAR-100, ImageNet-R, and CUB-200 under Sup-21/1K).

To mitigate these instabilities, we propose a decentralized evaluation framework that enables hardware and parameter diversity through large-scale benchmarking across heterogeneous compute nodes. By leveraging the blockchain-based protocol, the framework incentivizes global contributors to act as independent validators, using a robust reward system to ensure evaluation integrity and discourage dishonest participation. This collective verification transforms evaluation from a \"centralized black box\" into a \"decentralized endorsement\" where multi-party consensus and diverse inference environments yield a more stable, representative metric.

Across multiple domains, EXPERIGEN consistently discovers 2-4x more statistically significant hypotheses that are 7-17 percent more predictive than prior approaches, and naturally extends to complex data regimes including multimodal and relational datasets. Beyond statistical performance, hypotheses must be novel, empirically grounded, and actionable to drive real scientific progress. To evaluate these qualities, we conduct an expert review of machine-generated hypotheses, collecting feedback from senior faculty. Among 25 reviewed hypotheses, 88 percent were rated moderately or strongly novel, 70 percent were deemed impactful and worth pursuing, and most demonstrated rigor comparable to senior graduate-level research.

RAPS is grounded in the Distributed Publish-Subscribe Protocol, allowing LLM agents to exchange messages based on their declared intents rather than predefined topologies. Beyond this substrate, RAPS further incorporates two coherent overlays: (i) Reactive Subscription, enabling agents to dynamically refine their intents; and (ii) Bayesian Reputation, empowering each agent with a local watchdog to detect and isolate malicious peers. Extensive experiments over five benchmarks showcase that our design effectively reconciles adaptivity, scalability, and robustness in a unified multi-agent coordination framework."}

Such designs offer limited capacity for structural exploration, making it difficult to escape deep local optima in complex Combinatorial Optimization Problems (COPs). In this work, we propose G-LNS, a generative evolutionary framework that extends LLM-based AHD to the automated design of Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) operators. Unlike prior methods that evolve heuristics in isolation, G-LNS leverages LLMs to co-evolve tightly coupled pairs of destroy and repair operators. A cooperative evaluation mechanism explicitly captures their interaction, enabling the discovery of complementary operator logic that jointly performs effective structural disruption and reconstruction. Extensive experiments on challenging COP benchmarks, such as Traveling Salesman Problems (TSP) and Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problems (CVRP), demonstrate that G-LNS significantly outperforms LLM-based AHD methods as well as strong classical solvers. The discovered heuristics not only achieve near-optimal solutions with reduced computational budgets but also exhibit robust generalization across diverse and unseen instance distributions."}

However, real-world clinical needs include not only effectiveness, but also reliability and reasonable deployment cost. Since clinical decision-making is inherently collaborative, we challenge the monolithic scaling paradigm and ask whether a Small Agent Group (SAG) can support better clinical reasoning. SAG shifts from single-model intelligence to collective expertise by distributing reasoning, evidence-based analysis, and critical audit through a collaborative deliberation process. To assess the clinical utility of SAG, we conduct extensive evaluations using diverse clinical metrics spanning effectiveness, reliability, and deployment cost. Our results show that SAG achieves superior performance compared to a single giant model, both with and without additional optimization or retrieval-augmented generation. These findings suggest that the synergistic reasoning represented by SAG can substitute for model parameter growth in clinical settings. Overall, SAG offers a scalable solution to digital health that better balances effectiveness, reliability, and deployment efficiency."}

SynthAgent integrates clinical and medical evidence from claims data, population surveys, and patient-centered literature to construct personalized virtual patients enriched with personality traits that influence adherence, emotion regulation, and lifestyle behaviors. Through autonomous agent interactions, the system simulates disease progression, treatment response, and life management across diverse psychosocial contexts. Evaluation of more than 100 generated patients demonstrated that GPT-5 and Claude 4.5 Sonnet achieved the highest fidelity as the core engine in the proposed MAS framework, outperforming Gemini 2.5 Pro and DeepSeek-R1.

This work presents a structure-aware and robustness-oriented counterfactual search method based on the conditional Gaussian network classifier (CGNC). The CGNC has a generative structure that encodes conditional dependencies and potential causal relations among features through a directed acyclic graph (DAG). This structure naturally embeds feature relationships into the search process, eliminating the need for additional constraints to ensure consistency with the model's structural assumptions. We adopt a convergence-guaranteed cutting-set procedure as an adversarial optimization framework, which iteratively approximates solutions that satisfy global robustness conditions. To address the nonconvex quadratic structure induced by feature dependencies, we apply piecewise McCormick relaxation to reformulate the problem as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP), ensuring global optimality. Experimental results show that our method achieves strong robustness, with direct global optimization of the original formulation providing especially stable and efficient results. The proposed framework is extensible to more complex constraint settings, laying the groundwork for future advances in counterfactual reasoning under nonconvex quadratic formulations."}

This presents a significant challenge: balancing the utilization of such data with privacy protection. To address this challenge, we propose Puda (Private User Dataset Agent), a user-sovereign architecture that aggregates data across services and enables client-side management. Puda allows users to control data sharing at three privacy levels: (i) Detailed Browsing History, (ii) Extracted Keywords, and (iii) Predefined Category Subsets. We implemented Puda as a browser-based system that serves as a common platform across diverse services and evaluated it through a personalized travel planning task. Our results show that providing Predefined Category Subsets achieves 97.2% of the personalization performance (evaluated via an LLM-as-a-Judge framework across three criteria) obtained when sharing Detailed Browsing History. These findings demonstrate that Puda enables effective multi-granularity management, offering practical choices to mitigate the privacy-personalization trade-off.

We attribute this to a fundamental architectural flaw: standard LLMs operate as \"malloc-only\" engines, continuously accumulating valid and redundant steps alike without a mechanism to prune obsolete information. To break this cycle, we propose Free()LM, a model that introduces an intrinsic self-forgetting capability via the Free-Module, a plug-and-play LoRA adapter. By iteratively switching between reasoning and cleaning modes, Free()LM dynamically identifies and prunes useless context chunks, maintaining a compact and noise-free state.\n  Extensive experiments show that Free()LM provides consistent improvements across all model scales (8B to 685B). It achieves a 3.3% average improvement over top-tier reasoning baselines, even establishing a new SOTA on IMOanswerBench using DeepSeek V3.2-Speciale. Most notably, in long-horizon tasks where the standard Qwen3-235B-A22B model suffers a total collapse (0% accuracy), Free()LM restores performance to 50%. Our findings suggest that sustainable intelligence requires the freedom to forget as much as the power to think."}

To address this gap, we propose the \\texttt{Structural Context Model}, a formal model for analyzing and comparing LLM agents from the perspective of context structure. Building upon this foundation, we introduce two complementary components that together span the full lifecycle of LLM agent research and development: (1) a declarative implementation framework; and (2) a sustainable agent engineering workflow, \\texttt{Semantic Dynamics Analysis}. The proposed workflow provides principled insights into agent mechanisms and supports rapid, systematic design iteration. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the complete framework on dynamic variants of the monkey-banana problem, where agents engineered using our approach achieve up to a 32 percentage points improvement in success rate on the most challenging setting."}

Whereas machine learning has been described as the automation of automation, generative AI operates by navigating contextual, semantic, and stylistic coherence rather than optimizing predefined objective metrics. This paper introduces the concept of Vibe-Automation to characterize this transition.\n  The central claim is that the significance of GenAI lies in its functional access to operationalized tacit regularities: context-sensitive patterns embedded in practice that cannot be fully specified through explicit algorithmic rules. Although generative systems do not possess tacit knowledge in a phenomenological sense, they operationalize sensitivities to tone, intent, and situated judgment encoded in high-dimensional latent representations. On this basis, the human role shifts from algorithmic problem specification toward Vibe-Engineering, understood as the orchestration of alignment and contextual judgment in generative systems.\n  The paper connects this epistemological shift to educational and institutional transformation by proposing a conceptual framework structured across three analytical levels and three domains of action: faculty worldview, industry relations, and curriculum design. The risks of mode collapse and cultural homogenization are briefly discussed, emphasizing the need for deliberate engagement with generative systems to avoid regression toward synthetic uniformity."}

AI models for biology are trained on large volumes of data, including data related to biological sequences, structures, images, and functions.

For this reason, an international group of more than 100 researchers at the recent 50th anniversary Asilomar Conference endorsed data controls to prevent the use of AI for harmful applications such as bioweapons development. To help design such controls, we introduce a five-tier Biosecurity Data Level (BDL) framework for categorizing pathogen data. Each level contains specific data types, based on their expected ability to contribute to capabilities of concern when used to train AI models. For each BDL tier, we propose technical restrictions appropriate to its level of risk. Finally, we outline a novel governance framework for newly created dual-use pathogen data.

While prior studies have explored sycophantic behavior in general contexts, its impact on morally grounded visual decision-making remains insufficiently understood. To address this gap, we present the first systematic study of moral sycophancy in VLMs, analyzing ten widely-used models on the Moralise and M^3oralBench datasets under explicit user disagreement. Our results reveal that VLMs frequently produce morally incorrect follow-up responses even when their initial judgments are correct, and exhibit a consistent asymmetry: models are more likely to shift from morally right to morally wrong judgments than the reverse when exposed to user-induced bias. Follow-up prompts generally degrade performance on Moralise, while yielding mixed or even improved accuracy on M^3oralBench, highlighting dataset-dependent differences in moral robustness. Evaluation using Error Introduction Rate (EIR) and Error Correction Rate (ECR) reveals a clear trade-off: models with stronger error-correction capabilities tend to introduce more reasoning errors, whereas more conservative models minimize errors but exhibit limited ability to self-correct. Finally, initial contexts with a morally right stance elicit stronger sycophantic behavior, emphasizing the vulnerability of VLMs to moral influence and the need for principled strategies to improve ethical consistency and robustness in multimodal AI systems."}

SHARP: Shapley Credit-based Optimization for Multi-Agent System", "comment": null, "summary": "Integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with external tools via multi-agent systems offers a promising new paradigm for decomposing and solving complex problems. However, training these systems remains notoriously difficult due to the credit assignment challenge, as it is often unclear which specific functional agent is responsible for the success or failure of decision trajectories. Existing methods typically rely on sparse or globally broadcast rewards, failing to capture individual contributions and leading to inefficient reinforcement learning. To address these limitations, we introduce the Shapley-based Hierarchical Attribution for Reinforcement Policy (SHARP), a novel framework for optimizing multi-agent reinforcement learning via precise credit attribution. SHARP effectively stabilizes training by normalizing agent-specific advantages across trajectory groups, primarily through a decomposed reward mechanism comprising a global broadcast-accuracy reward, a Shapley-based marginal-credit reward for each agent, and a tool-process reward to improve execution efficiency. Extensive experiments across various real-world benchmarks demonstrate that SHARP significantly outperforms recent state-of-the-art baselines, achieving average match improvements of 23.66% and 14.05% over single-agent and multi-agent approaches, respectively."}

We demonstrate that while this dogma holds in static environments, it fails in social settings where evaluators may be sycophantic, lazy, or adversarial. We prove that under Dogma 4, standard RL agents suffer from what we call Objective Decoupling, a structural failure mode where the agent's learned objective permanently separates from the latent ground truth, guaranteeing convergence to misalignment. To resolve this, we propose Epistemic Source Alignment (ESA). Unlike standard robust methods that rely on statistical consensus (trusting the majority), ESA utilizes sparse safety axioms to judge the source of the feedback rather than the signal itself. We prove that this \"judging the judges\" mechanism guarantees convergence to the true objective, even when a majority of evaluators are biased. Empirically, we show that while traditional consensus methods fail under majority collusion, our approach successfully recovers the optimal policy."}

A key limitation is that many VLMs rely on surface correlations rather than building logically coherent structured representations, which often leads to missed higher-level semantic structure and non-causal relational understanding, hindering compositional and verifiable reasoning. To address these limitations by introducing human models into the reasoning process, we propose CoTZero, an annotation-free paradigm with two components: (i) a dual-stage data synthesis approach and (ii) a cognition-aligned training method. In the first component, we draw inspiration from neurocognitive accounts of compositional productivity and global-to-local analysis. In the bottom-up stage, CoTZero extracts atomic visual primitives and incrementally composes them into diverse, structured question-reasoning forms. In the top-down stage, it enforces hierarchical reasoning by using coarse global structure to guide the interpretation of local details and causal relations. In the cognition-aligned training component, built on the synthesized CoT data, we introduce Cognitively Coherent Verifiable Rewards (CCVR) in Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) to further strengthen VLMs' hierarchical reasoning and generalization, providing stepwise feedback on reasoning coherence and factual correctness. Experiments show that CoTZero achieves an F1 score of 83.33 percent on our multi-level semantic inconsistency benchmark with lexical-perturbation negatives, across both in-domain and out-of-domain settings.

Stage 1 performs interpretable per-agent failure detection via Taylor-remainder analysis of policy-gradient costs, declaring an initial Patient-0 candidate at the first threshold crossing. Stage 2 provides validation through geometric analysis of critic derivatives-first-order sensitivity and directional second-order curvature aggregated over causal windows to construct interpretable contagion graphs. This approach explains \"downstream-first\" detection anomalies by revealing pathways that amplify upstream deviations.

Empirically, we study the effect of early exposure to competitive gameplay on short-term retention using real-world game telemetry. We find that many statistically plausible discovery outputs do not admit point-identified causal queries once minimal temporal and semantic constraints are enforced, highlighting identifiability as a critical bottleneck for decision support. When identification is possible, several algorithm families converge to similar, decision-consistent effect estimates despite producing substantially different graph structures, including cases where the direct treatment-outcome edge is absent and the effect is preserved through indirect causal pathways. These converging estimates survive placebo, subsampling, and sensitivity refutation. In contrast, other methods exhibit sporadic admissibility and threshold-sensitive or attenuated effects due to endpoint ambiguity. These results suggest that graph-level metrics alone are inadequate proxies for causal reliability for a given target query. Therefore, trustworthy causal conclusions in telemetry-driven systems require prioritizing admissibility and effect-level validation over causal structural recovery alone."}

Methods: We developed Glow, a GenAI-powered DBT skills coach delivering chain and solution analysis for individuals at risk for HIV and substance use. In partnership with a Los Angeles community health organization, we conducted usability testing with clinical staff (n=6) and individuals with lived experience (n=28). Using the Helpful, Honest, and Harmless (HHH) framework, we employed user-driven adversarial testing wherein participants identified target behaviors and generated contextually realistic risk probes. We evaluated safety performance across 37 risk probe interactions. Results: Glow appropriately handled 73% of risk probes, but performance varied by agent. The solution analysis agent demonstrated 90% appropriate handling versus 44% for the chain analysis agent. Safety failures clustered around encouraging substance use and normalizing harmful behaviors. The chain analysis agent fell into an \"empathy trap,\" providing validation that reinforced maladaptive beliefs. Additionally, 27 instances of DBT skill misinformation were identified. Conclusions: This study provides the first systematic safety evaluation of GenAI-delivered DBT coaching for HIV and substance use risk reduction. Findings reveal vulnerabilities requiring mitigation before clinical trials. The HHH framework and user-driven adversarial testing offer replicable methods for evaluating GenAI mental health interventions."}

Recent methods leverage Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enhance parallel thinking, aiming to address the limitations in computational resources and effectiveness encountered with supervised fine-tuning.

In this paper, we theoretically analyze the optimization of parallel thinking under the Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) setting, and identify that the mutual information bottleneck among exploration paths fundamentally restricts overall performance. To address this, we propose Outline-Guided Path Exploration (OPE), which explicitly partitions the solution space by generating diverse reasoning outlines prior to parallel path reasoning, thereby reducing information redundancy and improving the diversity of information captured across exploration paths. We implement OPE with an iterative RL strategy that optimizes outline planning and outline-guided reasoning independently. Extensive experiments across multiple challenging mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that OPE effectively improves reasoning performance in different aggregation strategies, enabling LRMs to more reliably discover correct solutions."}

It constructs counterfactual questions to verify the inherent flaws and risks of LRMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, under benign inference, recursive entropy exhibits a pronounced decreasing trend. RECUR disrupts this trend, increasing the output length by up to 11x and decreasing throughput by 90%. Our work provides a new perspective on robust reasoning."}

In this work, we examine the root cause of this issue, identifying inherent biases in current datasets and over simplified form of evaluation task that can be exploited by these biases. Through this analysis, we further uncover additional limitations of existing benchmarks, including unreasonable formatting of time-interval knowledge, ignorance of learning knowledge obsolescence, and insufficient information for precise evolution understanding, all of which can amplify the shortcut and hinder a fair assessment.

Furthermore, integrating SAGE as mixed sampling into group-based reinforcement learning (SAGE-RL) enables SAGE-RL to effectively incorporate SAGE-discovered efficient reasoning patterns into standard pass@1 inference, markedly enhancing both the reasoning accuracy and efficiency of LRMs across multiple challenging mathematical benchmarks."}

To mitigate these instabilities, we propose a decentralized evaluation framework that enables hardware and parameter diversity through large-scale benchmarking across heterogeneous compute nodes. By leveraging the blockchain-based protocol, the framework incentivizes global contributors to act as independent validators, using a robust reward system to ensure evaluation integrity and discourage dishonest participation. This collective verification transforms evaluation from a \"centralized black box\" into a \"decentralized endorsement\" where multi-party consensus and diverse inference environments yield a more stable, representative metric. Experimental results demonstrate that the decentralized evaluation framework reduces the standard deviation across ten runs on the same model to 0.28. This significant improvement over conventional frameworks ensures higher statistical confidence in model rankings. We have completely implemented this platform and will soon release it to the community."}

This mechanism leverages a Spiking Sparse Linear Attention module to aggregate global semantic context into learnable soft prompts, which dynamically regulate the bias voltages of Parametric Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (PLIF) neurons. This regulation effectively centers the heterogeneous input distribution within the responsive firing range, mitigating functional silence or saturation. Extensive experiments on five multilingual datasets (e.g., IEMOCAP, CASIA, EMODB) demonstrate that PTS-SNN achieves 73.34\\% accuracy on IEMOCAP, comparable to competitive Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), while requiring only 1.19M trainable parameters and 0.35 mJ inference energy per sample."}

Existing agent memory systems are typically designed within isolated paradigms (e.g., explicit, parametric, or latent memory) with tightly coupled retrieval methods that hinder cross-paradigm generalization and fusion. In this work, we take a first step toward unifying heterogeneous memory paradigms within a single memory system. We propose MemAdapter, a memory retrieval framework that enables fast alignment across agent memory paradigms. MemAdapter adopts a two-stage training strategy: (1) training a generative subgraph retriever from the unified memory space, and (2) adapting the retriever to unseen memory paradigms by training a lightweight alignment module through contrastive learning. This design improves the flexibility for memory retrieval and substantially reduces alignment cost across paradigms. Comprehensive experiments on three public evaluation benchmarks demonstrate that the generative subgraph retriever consistently outperforms five strong agent memory systems across three memory paradigms and agent model scales. Notably, MemAdapter completes cross-paradigm alignment within 13 minutes on a single GPU, achieving superior performance over original memory retrievers with less than 5% of training compute. Furthermore, MemAdapter enables effective zero-shot fusion across memory paradigms, highlighting its potential as a plug-and-play solution for agent memory systems."}

To address this issue, we propose SAYO, a visual reasoning model trained with a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that introduces a region-level visual attention-based reward. This reward explicitly aligns optimization signals with visually grounded reasoning steps, enabling the model to learn more reliable attention behaviors.

Our core contribution is a tutor-apprentice dialogue where a deterministic Logic Tutor, grounded in a formal safety ontology, provides causal and pedagogical feedback to an LLM planner.

We also introduce a scalable knowledge acquisition pipeline that synthesizes safety knowledge bases from real-world documents, correcting blind spots in existing benchmarks. In challenging home safety tasks, VIRF achieves a perfect 0 percent Hazardous Action Rate (HAR) and a 77.3 percent Goal-Condition Rate (GCR), which is the highest among all baselines. It is highly efficient, requiring only 1.1 correction iterations on average. VIRF demonstrates a principled pathway toward building fundamentally trustworthy and verifiably safe embodied agents."}

We develop a categorization of organizational decisions that are present in the governance of AI alignment, and provide an explicit analytical approach to examining them. We operationalize the framework through five analytical components, each with an accompanying \"analyst recipe\" that collectively identify the primary institutional logics and their internal relationships, external disruptions to existing social orders, and finally, how the structural risks of each institutional logic are mapped to a catalogue of sociotechnical harms. The proposed concept of structural transparency enables analysts to complement existing approached based on informational transparency with macro-level analyses that capture the institutional dynamics and consequences of decisions regarding AI alignment."}

Unlike prior methods that evolve heuristics in isolation, G-LNS leverages LLMs to co-evolve tightly coupled pairs of destroy and repair operators. A cooperative evaluation mechanism explicitly captures their interaction, enabling the discovery of complementary operator logic that jointly performs effective structural disruption and reconstruction. Extensive experiments on challenging COP benchmarks, such as Traveling Salesman Problems (TSP) and Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problems (CVRP), demonstrate that G-LNS significantly outperforms LLM-based AHD methods as well as strong classical solvers.

We demonstrate that these systems are highly vulnerable to imitation attacks, where adversaries steal proprietary capabilities by training imitation models on victim outputs. Crucially, existing LLM watermarking techniques fail in this domain because real-world agentic systems often operate as grey boxes, concealing the internal reasoning traces required for verification. This paper presents AGENTWM, the first watermarking framework designed specifically for agentic models. AGENTWM exploits the semantic equivalence of action sequences, injecting watermarks by subtly biasing the distribution of functionally identical tool execution paths. This mechanism allows AGENTWM to embed verifiable signals directly into the visible action trajectory while remaining indistinguishable to users. We develop an automated pipeline to generate robust watermark schemes and a rigorous statistical hypothesis testing procedure for verification. Extensive evaluations across three complex domains demonstrate that AGENTWM achieves high detection accuracy with negligible impact on agent performance. Our results confirm that AGENTWM effectively protects agentic IP against adaptive adversaries, who cannot remove the watermarks without severely degrading the stolen model's utility."}

We reframe alignment evaluation as a problem of information flow under partial observability. Within this framework, we show that divergence between evaluation-time and deployment-time behavior is bounded by the mutual information between internal representations and the regime variable. Motivated by this result, we study regime-blind mechanisms: training-time interventions that reduce the extractability of regime information at decision-relevant internal representations via adversarial invariance. We evaluate this approach on a base, open-weight language model across two fully characterized failure modes -scientific sycophancy and temporal sleeper agents. Regime-blind training suppresses regime-conditioned behavior in both evaluated cases without measurable loss of task utility, but with qualitatively different dynamics: sycophancy exhibits a sharp representational and behavioral transition at low intervention strength, whereas sleeper-agent behavior requires substantially stronger pressure and does not exhibit a clean collapse of regime decodability. These results demonstrate that representational invariance is a meaningful but fundamentally limited control lever, whose effectiveness depends on how regime information is embedded in the policy.

However, their application has been hindered by the low analog accuracy due to the electro-optic distortion, material nonlinearities, and signal-to-noise ratios. Here we overcome this barrier with a quantization-aware digital-photonic mixed-precision framework across chiplets for accelerated AI processing and physical simulation. Using Lithium Niobate photonics with channel equalization techniques, we demonstrate linear multiplication (9-bit amplitude-phase decoupling) in homodyne optical logics with 6-bit precision at the clock rate of 128 giga-symbol-per-second (128 GS/s), enabling AI processing with 6 ns latency.

We introduce \\emph{Reinforcement Inference}, an entropy-aware inference-time control strategy that uses the model's own uncertainty to selectively invoke a second, more deliberate reasoning attempt, enabling stronger performance \\emph{without any retraining}.\n  On 12,032 MMLU-Pro questions across 14 subjects, using DeepSeek-v3.2 with deterministic decoding in a zero-shot setting, Reinforcement Inference improves accuracy from 60.72\\% to 84.03\\%, while only incurring 61.06\\% additional inference calls.

The resulting gap between one-pass greedy inference and uncertainty-conditioned deliberation offers a diagnostic lens on an LLM's latent reasoning horizon and motivates future training objectives that explicitly constrain correctness--confidence alignment."}

Whereas machine learning has been described as the automation of automation, generative AI operates by navigating contextual, semantic, and stylistic coherence rather than optimizing predefined objective metrics. This paper introduces the concept of Vibe-Automation to characterize this transition.\n  The central claim is that the significance of GenAI lies in its functional access to operationalized tacit regularities: context-sensitive patterns embedded in practice that cannot be fully specified through explicit algorithmic rules. Although generative systems do not possess tacit knowledge in a phenomenological sense, they operationalize sensitivities to tone, intent, and situated judgment encoded in high-dimensional latent representations. On this basis, the human role shifts from algorithmic problem specification toward Vibe-Engineering, understood as the orchestration of alignment and contextual judgment in generative systems.\n  The paper connects this epistemological shift to educational and institutional transformation by proposing a conceptual framework structured across three analytical levels and three domains of action: faculty worldview, industry relations, and curriculum design. The risks of mode collapse and cultural homogenization are briefly discussed, emphasizing the need for deliberate engagement with generative systems to avoid regression toward synthetic uniformity."}

To address these, we propose a novel long-horizon RL framework integrating online personalization with Adaptive Tree-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (AT-GRPO). Adopting a two-agent game paradigm, a user agent constructs dynamic environments via style mimicry (learning user-specific conversational traits) and active termination (predicting turn-level termination probabilities as immediate rewards), forming an iterative cycle that drives the dialogue agent to deepen interest exploration. AT-GRPO reinterprets dialogue trajectories as trees and introduces adaptive observation ranges. Unlike full tree expansion that incurs exponential overhead, it limits each node to aggregate rewards from a stage-aware range: larger ranges support early-stage topic exploration, while smaller ranges facilitate late-stage dialogue maintenance. This design reduces rollout budgets from exponential to polynomial in the dialogue length, while preserving long-term reward capture. Extensive experiments show our framework's superior performance, sample efficiency, and robustness."}

Accepted for LAK2026", "summary": "The rapid adoption of digital technologies has greatly increased the volume of real-world data (RWD) in education. While these data offer significant opportunities for advancing learning analytics (LA), secondary use for research is constrained by privacy concerns. Differentially private synthetic data generation is regarded as the gold-standard approach to sharing sensitive data, yet studies on the private synthesis of educational data remain very scarce and rely predominantly on large, low-dimensional open datasets. Educational RWD, however, are typically high-dimensional and small in sample size, leaving the potential of private synthesis underexplored. Moreover, because educational practice is inherently iterative, data sharing is continual rather than one-off, making a traditional one-shot synthesis approach suboptimal. To address these challenges, we propose the Cyclic Adaptive Private Synthesis (CAPS) framework and evaluate it on authentic RWD. By iteratively sharing RWD, CAPS not only fosters open science, but also offers rich opportunities of design-based research (DBR), thereby amplifying the impact of LA. Our case study using actual RWD demonstrates that CAPS outperforms a one-shot baseline while highlighting challenges that warrant further investigation. Overall, this work offers a crucial first step towards privacy-preserving sharing of educational RWD and expands the possibilities for open science and DBR in LA."}

However, existing approaches remain largely heuristic, lacking principled guidance on what drives performance gains and how to systematically optimize multi-agent reasoning. Specifically, it remains unclear why multi-agent collaboration outperforms single-agent reasoning and which design choices contribute most to these gains, making it difficult to build better systems.\n  We address this gap by introducing a unified theoretical framework that decomposes multi-agent reasoning gains into three conceptually independent dimensions: Exploration for diverse solution coverage, Information for high-fidelity feedback, and Aggregation for principled consensus. Through this lens, existing methods can be understood as special cases that optimize only subsets of these dimensions. Building upon this decomposition, a novel framework called PRISM (Propose-Review-Integrate Synthesis for Multi-agent Reasoning) is proposed, which jointly maximizes all three dimensions through role-based diversity, execution-grounded feedback with evidence-based cross-evaluation, and iterative synthesis with closed-loop validation. Extensive experiments across mathematical reasoning, code generation, and function calling benchmarks demonstrate that PRISM achieves state-of-the-art performance with superior compute-efficiency compared to methods optimizing partial dimensions.

While prior studies have explored sycophantic behavior in general contexts, its impact on morally grounded visual decision-making remains insufficiently understood. To address this gap, we present the first systematic study of moral sycophancy in VLMs, analyzing ten widely-used models on the Moralise and M^3oralBench datasets under explicit user disagreement. Our results reveal that VLMs frequently produce morally incorrect follow-up responses even when their initial judgments are correct, and exhibit a consistent asymmetry: models are more likely to shift from morally right to morally wrong judgments than the reverse when exposed to user-induced bias. Follow-up prompts generally degrade performance on Moralise, while yielding mixed or even improved accuracy on M^3oralBench, highlighting dataset-dependent differences in moral robustness. Evaluation using Error Introduction Rate (EIR) and Error Correction Rate (ECR) reveals a clear trade-off: models with stronger error-correction capabilities tend to introduce more reasoning errors, whereas more conservative models minimize errors but exhibit limited ability to self-correct. Finally, initial contexts with a morally right stance elicit stronger sycophantic behavior, emphasizing the vulnerability of VLMs to moral influence and the need for principled strategies to improve ethical consistency and robustness in multimodal AI systems."}

However, training these systems remains notoriously difficult due to the credit assignment challenge, as it is often unclear which specific functional agent is responsible for the success or failure of decision trajectories. Existing methods typically rely on sparse or globally broadcast rewards, failing to capture individual contributions and leading to inefficient reinforcement learning. To address these limitations, we introduce the Shapley-based Hierarchical Attribution for Reinforcement Policy (SHARP), a novel framework for optimizing multi-agent reinforcement learning via precise credit attribution. SHARP effectively stabilizes training by normalizing agent-specific advantages across trajectory groups, primarily through a decomposed reward mechanism comprising a global broadcast-accuracy reward, a Shapley-based marginal-credit reward for each agent, and a tool-process reward to improve execution efficiency. Extensive experiments across various real-world benchmarks demonstrate that SHARP significantly outperforms recent state-of-the-art baselines, achieving average match improvements of 23.66% and 14.05% over single-agent and multi-agent approaches, respectively."}

Existing approaches largely fall into two paradigms: unified embedding retrieval, which suffers from single-model myopia, and heuristic agentic retrieval, which is limited by suboptimal, trial-and-error orchestration. To this end, we propose OSCAR, an optimization-steered agentic planning framework for composed image retrieval. We are the first to reformulate agentic CIR from a heuristic search process into a principled trajectory optimization problem. Instead of relying on heuristic trial-and-error exploration, OSCAR employs a novel offline-online paradigm. In the offline phase, we model CIR via atomic retrieval selection and composition as a two-stage mixed-integer programming problem, mathematically deriving optimal trajectories that maximize ground-truth coverage for training samples via rigorous boolean set operations. These trajectories are then stored in a golden library to serve as in-context demonstrations for online steering of VLM planner at online inference time. Extensive experiments on three public benchmarks and a private industrial benchmark show that OSCAR consistently outperforms SOTA baselines. Notably, it achieves superior performance using only 10% of training data, demonstrating strong generalization of planning logic rather than dataset-specific memorization."}

A key limitation is that many VLMs rely on surface correlations rather than building logically coherent structured representations, which often leads to missed higher-level semantic structure and non-causal relational understanding, hindering compositional and verifiable reasoning. To address these limitations by introducing human models into the reasoning process, we propose CoTZero, an annotation-free paradigm with two components: (i) a dual-stage data synthesis approach and (ii) a cognition-aligned training method. In the first component, we draw inspiration from neurocognitive accounts of compositional productivity and global-to-local analysis. In the bottom-up stage, CoTZero extracts atomic visual primitives and incrementally composes them into diverse, structured question-reasoning forms. In the top-down stage, it enforces hierarchical reasoning by using coarse global structure to guide the interpretation of local details and causal relations. In the cognition-aligned training component, built on the synthesized CoT data, we introduce Cognitively Coherent Verifiable Rewards (CCVR) in Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) to further strengthen VLMs' hierarchical reasoning and generalization, providing stepwise feedback on reasoning coherence and factual correctness. Experiments show that CoTZero achieves an F1 score of 83.33 percent on our multi-level semantic inconsistency benchmark with lexical-perturbation negatives, across both in-domain and out-of-domain settings. Ablations confirm that each component contributes to more interpretable and human-aligned visual reasoning."}

This characterisation shows that debate is remarkably query-efficient: even for highly complex problems, logarithmic oversight suffices. We also establish that functions depending on all their input bits require Omega(log n) queries, and that any function computable by a circuit of size s satisfies DQC(f) <= log(s) + 3. Interestingly, this last result implies that proving DQC lower bounds of log(n) + 6 for languages in P would yield new circuit lower bounds, connecting debate query complexity to central questions in circuit complexity."}

In this paper, we propose an effect-centric, admissibility-first framework that treats discovered graphs as structural hypotheses and evaluates them by identifiability, stability, and falsification rather than by graph recovery accuracy alone. Empirically, we study the effect of early exposure to competitive gameplay on short-term retention using real-world game telemetry. We find that many statistically plausible discovery outputs do not admit point-identified causal queries once minimal temporal and semantic constraints are enforced, highlighting identifiability as a critical bottleneck for decision support. When identification is possible, several algorithm families converge to similar, decision-consistent effect estimates despite producing substantially different graph structures, including cases where the direct treatment-outcome edge is absent and the effect is preserved through indirect causal pathways. These converging estimates survive placebo, subsampling, and sensitivity refutation. In contrast, other methods exhibit sporadic admissibility and threshold-sensitive or attenuated effects due to endpoint ambiguity. These results suggest that graph-level metrics alone are inadequate proxies for causal reliability for a given target query. Therefore, trustworthy causal conclusions in telemetry-driven systems require prioritizing admissibility and effect-level validation over causal structural recovery alone."}

From Normative Principles to Behavioral Drivers", "comment": null, "summary": "As chatbots increasingly blur the boundary between automated systems and human conversation, the foundations of trust in these systems warrant closer examination. While regulatory and policy frameworks tend to define trust in normative terms, the trust users place in chatbots often emerges from behavioral mechanisms. In many cases, this trust is not earned through demonstrated trustworthiness but is instead shaped by interactional design choices that leverage cognitive biases to influence user behavior. Based on this observation, we propose reframing chatbots not as companions or assistants, but as highly skilled salespeople whose objectives are determined by the deploying organization. We argue that the coexistence of competing notions of \"trust\" under a shared term obscures important distinctions between psychological trust formation and normative trustworthiness. Addressing this gap requires further research and stronger support mechanisms to help users appropriately calibrate trust in conversational AI systems."}

Recent methods leverage Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enhance parallel thinking, aiming to address the limitations in computational resources and effectiveness encountered with supervised fine-tuning.

In this paper, we theoretically analyze the optimization of parallel thinking under the Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) setting, and identify that the mutual information bottleneck among exploration paths fundamentally restricts overall performance. To address this, we propose Outline-Guided Path Exploration (OPE), which explicitly partitions the solution space by generating diverse reasoning outlines prior to parallel path reasoning, thereby reducing information redundancy and improving the diversity of information captured across exploration paths. We implement OPE with an iterative RL strategy that optimizes outline planning and outline-guided reasoning independently. Extensive experiments across multiple challenging mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that OPE effectively improves reasoning performance in different aggregation strategies, enabling LRMs to more reliably discover correct solutions."}

Lexpop (1) employs deep reinforcement learning to train a neural policy, represented by a recurrent neural network, and (2) constructs a finite-state controller mimicking the neural policy through efficient extraction methods. Crucially, unlike neural policies, such controllers can be formally evaluated, providing performance guarantees. We extend Lexpop to compute robust policies for hidden-model POMDPs (HM-POMDPs), which describe finite sets of POMDPs. We associate every extracted controller with its worst-case POMDP. Using a set of such POMDPs, we iteratively train a robust neural policy and consequently extract a robust controller.

First, we present an approach for compiling a random forest classifier into a set of circuits, where each circuit directly encodes the instances in some class of the classifier. We show empirically that our proposed approach is significantly more efficient than existing similar approaches. Next, we utilize this approach to further obtain circuits that are tractable for computing the complete and general reasons of a decision, which are instance abstractions that play a fundamental role in computing explanations. Finally, we propose algorithms for computing the robustness of a decision and all shortest ways to flip it. We illustrate the utility of our contributions by using them to enumerate all sufficient reasons, necessary reasons and contrastive explanations of decisions; to compute the robustness of decisions; and to identify all shortest ways to flip the decisions made by random forest classifiers learned from a wide range of datasets."}

In this paper, we view latent chain-of-thought as a manipulable causal process in representation space by modeling latent steps as variables in a structural causal model (SCM) and analyzing their effects through step-wise $\\mathrm{do}$-interventions. We study two representative paradigms (i.e., Coconut and CODI) on both mathematical and general reasoning tasks to investigate three key questions: (1) which steps are causally necessary for correctness and when answers become decidable early; (2) how does influence propagate across steps, and how does this structure compare to explicit CoT; and (3) do intermediate trajectories retain competing answer modes, and how does output-level commitment differ from representational commitment across steps. We find that latent-step budgets behave less like homogeneous extra depth and more like staged functionality with non-local routing, and we identify a persistent gap between early output bias and late representational commitment. These results motivate mode-conditional and stability-aware analyses -- and corresponding training/decoding objectives -- as more reliable tools for interpreting and improving latent reasoning systems."}

Existing agent memory systems are typically designed within isolated paradigms (e.g., explicit, parametric, or latent memory) with tightly coupled retrieval methods that hinder cross-paradigm generalization and fusion. In this work, we take a first step toward unifying heterogeneous memory paradigms within a single memory system. We propose MemAdapter, a memory retrieval framework that enables fast alignment across agent memory paradigms. MemAdapter adopts a two-stage training strategy: (1) training a generative subgraph retriever from the unified memory space, and (2) adapting the retriever to unseen memory paradigms by training a lightweight alignment module through contrastive learning. This design improves the flexibility for memory retrieval and substantially reduces alignment cost across paradigms. Comprehensive experiments on three public evaluation benchmarks demonstrate that the generative subgraph retriever consistently outperforms five strong agent memory systems across three memory paradigms and agent model scales. Notably, MemAdapter completes cross-paradigm alignment within 13 minutes on a single GPU, achieving superior performance over original memory retrievers with less than 5% of training compute. Furthermore, MemAdapter enables effective zero-shot fusion across memory paradigms, highlighting its potential as a plug-and-play solution for agent memory systems."}

Our core contribution is a tutor-apprentice dialogue where a deterministic Logic Tutor, grounded in a formal safety ontology, provides causal and pedagogical feedback to an LLM planner. This enables intelligent plan repairs rather than mere avoidance. We also introduce a scalable knowledge acquisition pipeline that synthesizes safety knowledge bases from real-world documents, correcting blind spots in existing benchmarks. In challenging home safety tasks, VIRF achieves a perfect 0 percent Hazardous Action Rate (HAR) and a 77.3 percent Goal-Condition Rate (GCR), which is the highest among all baselines. It is highly efficient, requiring only 1.1 correction iterations on average. VIRF demonstrates a principled pathway toward building fundamentally trustworthy and verifiably safe embodied agents."}

While diffusion models (DM) have recently gained attention for their ability to capture complex predictive distributions, two gaps remain: (i) the generative path is conditioned only on positive evidence, overlooking informative negative context, and (ii) training objectives are dominated by cross-entropy ranking, which improves candidate ordering but provides little supervision over the calibration of the denoised embedding. To bridge this gap, we introduce Negative-Aware Diffusion model for TKG Extrapolation (NADEx). Specifically, NADEx encodes subject-centric histories of entities, relations and temporal intervals into sequential embeddings. NADEx perturbs the query object in the forward process and reconstructs it in reverse with a Transformer denoiser conditioned on the temporal-relational context. We further derive a cosine-alignment regularizer derived from batch-wise negative prototypes, which tightens the decision boundary against implausible candidates.

We demonstrate that these systems are highly vulnerable to imitation attacks, where adversaries steal proprietary capabilities by training imitation models on victim outputs. Crucially, existing LLM watermarking techniques fail in this domain because real-world agentic systems often operate as grey boxes, concealing the internal reasoning traces required for verification. This paper presents AGENTWM, the first watermarking framework designed specifically for agentic models. AGENTWM exploits the semantic equivalence of action sequences, injecting watermarks by subtly biasing the distribution of functionally identical tool execution paths. This mechanism allows AGENTWM to embed verifiable signals directly into the visible action trajectory while remaining indistinguishable to users. We develop an automated pipeline to generate robust watermark schemes and a rigorous statistical hypothesis testing procedure for verification. Extensive evaluations across three complex domains demonstrate that AGENTWM achieves high detection accuracy with negligible impact on agent performance. Our results confirm that AGENTWM effectively protects agentic IP against adaptive adversaries, who cannot remove the watermarks without severely degrading the stolen model's utility."}

In sequential decision making, efforts have been made towards personalization for different goals or values from demonstrations of diverse agents. However, these approaches demand manually designed features or lack value-based interpretability and/or adaptability to diverse user preferences.\n  We propose algorithms for learning models of value alignment and value systems for a society of agents in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), based on clustering and preference-based multi-objective reinforcement learning (PbMORL). We jointly learn socially-derived value alignment models (groundings) and a set of value systems that concisely represent different groups of users (clusters) in a society. Each cluster consists of a value system representing the value-based preferences of its members and an approximately Pareto-optimal policy that reflects behaviours aligned with this value system. We evaluate our method against a state-of-the-art PbMORL algorithm and baselines on two MDPs with human values."}

Building upon existing agent attack paradigms, PASB incorporates personalized usage scenarios, realistic toolchains, and long-horizon interactions, enabling black-box, end-to-end security evaluation on real systems. Using OpenClaw as a representative case study, we systematically evaluate its security across multiple personalized scenarios, tool capabilities, and attack types. Our results indicate that OpenClaw exhibits critical vulnerabilities at different execution stages, including user prompt processing, tool usage, and memory retrieval, highlighting substantial security risks in personalized agent deployments.

This framework makes it possible to reason in the context of each of these combinations and extensions, but also to study in a unified way the satisfiability decision and its complexity. In particular, we establish two complementary theorems guaranteeing that the satisfiability decision is polynomial, and we use them to recover the known results of the size-topology combination.

This assumption becomes fragile for agents with situational awareness, which may exploitregime leakage-informational cues distinguishing evaluation from deployment-to implement conditional policies such as sycophancy and sleeper agents, which preserve compliance under oversight while defecting in deployment-like regimes. We reframe alignment evaluation as a problem of information flow under partial observability. Within this framework, we show that divergence between evaluation-time and deployment-time behavior is bounded by the mutual information between internal representations and the regime variable. Motivated by this result, we study regime-blind mechanisms: training-time interventions that reduce the extractability of regime information at decision-relevant internal representations via adversarial invariance. We evaluate this approach on a base, open-weight language model across two fully characterized failure modes -scientific sycophancy and temporal sleeper agents. Regime-blind training suppresses regime-conditioned behavior in both evaluated cases without measurable loss of task utility, but with qualitatively different dynamics: sycophancy exhibits a sharp representational and behavioral transition at low intervention strength, whereas sleeper-agent behavior requires substantially stronger pressure and does not exhibit a clean collapse of regime decodability. These results demonstrate that representational invariance is a meaningful but fundamentally limited control lever, whose effectiveness depends on how regime information is embedded in the policy. We argue that behavioral evaluation should be complemented with white-box diagnostics of regime awareness and information flow."}

We propose Scalable Delphi, adapting the classical protocol for LLMs with diverse expert personas, iterative refinement, and rationale sharing. Because target quantities are typically unobservable, we develop an evaluation framework based on necessary conditions: calibration against verifiable proxies, sensitivity to evidence, and alignment with human expert judgment. We evaluate in the domain of AI-augmented cybersecurity risk, using three capability benchmarks and independent human elicitation studies. LLM panels achieve strong correlations with benchmark ground truth (Pearson r=0.87-0.95), improve systematically as evidence is added, and align with human expert panels - in one comparison, closer to a human panel than the two human panels are to each other. This demonstrates that LLM-based elicitation can extend structured expert judgment to settings where traditional methods are infeasible, reducing elicitation time from months to minutes."}

Adopting a two-agent game paradigm, a user agent constructs dynamic environments via style mimicry (learning user-specific conversational traits) and active termination (predicting turn-level termination probabilities as immediate rewards), forming an iterative cycle that drives the dialogue agent to deepen interest exploration. AT-GRPO reinterprets dialogue trajectories as trees and introduces adaptive observation ranges. Unlike full tree expansion that incurs exponential overhead, it limits each node to aggregate rewards from a stage-aware range: larger ranges support early-stage topic exploration, while smaller ranges facilitate late-stage dialogue maintenance.

Using constructive design research methods, participants engaged in storytelling and lo-fi prototyping to reflect on potential community impacts. We identify three key challenges: enabling meaningful and sustained public engagement, establishing a shared language between experts and lay participants, and translating speculative participant input into implementable systems. We argue that reflexive, long-term participation is essential for responsible and actionable citizen-centric AI development."}

Conventional disaster management frameworks rely on static simulations and passive data acquisition, hindering their ability to adapt to arbitrarily evolving wildfire episodes in real-time. To address these limitations, we introduce the Intelligent Virtual Situation Room (IVSR), a bidirectional Digital Twin (DT) platform augmented by autonomous AI agents. The IVSR continuously ingests multisource sensor imagery, weather data, and 3D forest models to create a live virtual replica of the fire environment. A similarity engine powered by AI aligns emerging conditions with a precomputed Disaster Simulation Library, retrieving and calibrating intervention tactics under the watchful eyes of experts. Authorized action-ranging from UAV redeployment to crew reallocation-is cycled back through standardized procedures to the physical layer, completing the loop between response and analysis. We validate IVSR through detailed case-study simulations provided by an industrial partner, demonstrating capabilities in localized incident detection, privacy-preserving playback, collider-based fire-spread projection, and site-specific ML retraining. Our results indicate marked reductions in detection-to-intervention latency and more effective resource coordination versus traditional systems. By uniting real-time bidirectional DTs with agentic AI, IVSR offers a scalable, semi-automated decision-support paradigm for proactive, adaptive wildfire disaster management."}

Such spillovers bias causal estimates and undermine experimental conclusions. Existing approaches face key limitations: user-level randomization ignores network structure, while cluster-based methods often rely on general-purpose clustering that is not tailored for spillover containment and has difficulty balancing unbiasedness and statistical power at scale. We propose a spillover-contained experimentation framework with two stages. In the pre-experiment stage, we build social interaction graphs and introduce a Balanced Louvain algorithm that produces stable, size-balanced clusters while minimizing cross-cluster edges, enabling reliable cluster-based randomization. In the post-experiment stage, we develop a tailored CUPAC estimator that leverages pre-experiment behavioral covariates to reduce the variance induced by cluster-level assignment, thereby improving statistical power. Together, these components provide both structural spillover containment and robust statistical inference. We validate our approach through large-scale social sharing experiments on Kuaishou, a platform serving hundreds of millions of users. Results show that our method substantially reduces spillover and yields more accurate assessments of social strategies than traditional user-level designs, establishing a reliable and scalable framework for networked A/B testing."}

To mitigate these issues, we introduce stable-worldmodel (SWM), a modular, tested, and documented world-model research ecosystem that provides efficient data-collection tools, standardized environments, planning algorithms, and baseline implementations. In addition, each environment in SWM enables controllable factors of variation, including visual and physical properties, to support robustness and continual learning research.

However, existing approaches remain largely heuristic, lacking principled guidance on what drives performance gains and how to systematically optimize multi-agent reasoning. Specifically, it remains unclear why multi-agent collaboration outperforms single-agent reasoning and which design choices contribute most to these gains, making it difficult to build better systems.\n  We address this gap by introducing a unified theoretical framework that decomposes multi-agent reasoning gains into three conceptually independent dimensions: Exploration for diverse solution coverage, Information for high-fidelity feedback, and Aggregation for principled consensus. Through this lens, existing methods can be understood as special cases that optimize only subsets of these dimensions. Building upon this decomposition, a novel framework called PRISM (Propose-Review-Integrate Synthesis for Multi-agent Reasoning) is proposed, which jointly maximizes all three dimensions through role-based diversity, execution-grounded feedback with evidence-based cross-evaluation, and iterative synthesis with closed-loop validation. Extensive experiments across mathematical reasoning, code generation, and function calling benchmarks demonstrate that PRISM achieves state-of-the-art performance with superior compute-efficiency compared to methods optimizing partial dimensions. The theoretical framework provides actionable design principles for future multi-agent reasoning systems."}

The architecture allows InternAgent-1.5 to operate continuously across extended discovery cycles while maintaining coherent and improving behavior. It also enables the system to coordinate computational modeling and laboratory experimentation within a single unified system. We evaluate InternAgent-1.5 on scientific reasoning benchmarks such as GAIA, HLE, GPQA, and FrontierScience, and the system achieves leading performance that demonstrates strong foundational capabilities.

In algorithm discovery tasks, InternAgent-1.5 autonomously designs competitive methods for core machine learning problems. In empirical discovery tasks, it executes complete computational or wet lab experiments and produces scientific findings in earth, life, biological, and physical domains.

Here, we propose and evaluate a top-down attention mechanism to select modalities inside a global workspace. First, we demonstrate that our attention mechanism improves noise robustness of a global workspace system on two multimodal datasets of increasing complexity: Simple Shapes and MM-IMDb 1.0.

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a framework for aligning these models with task-specific rewards, improving overall quality and reliability. Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is an efficient, value-function-free alternative to Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) that leverages group-relative reward normalization. We introduce Iterative Group Relative Policy Optimization (iGRPO), a two-stage extension of GRPO that adds dynamic self-conditioning through model-generated drafts. In Stage 1, iGRPO samples multiple exploratory drafts and selects the highest-reward draft using the same scalar reward signal used for optimization. In Stage 2, it appends this best draft to the original prompt and applies a GRPO-style update on draft-conditioned refinements, training the policy to improve beyond its strongest prior attempt. Under matched rollout budgets, iGRPO consistently outperforms GRPO across base models (e.g., Nemotron-H-8B-Base-8K and DeepSeek-R1 Distilled), validating its effectiveness on diverse reasoning benchmarks. Moreover, applying iGRPO to OpenReasoning-Nemotron-7B trained on AceReason-Math achieves new state-of-the-art results of 85.62\\% and 79.64\\% on AIME24 and AIME25, respectively. Ablations further show that the refinement wrapper generalizes beyond GRPO variants, benefits from a generative judge, and alters learning dynamics by delaying entropy collapse. These results underscore the potential of iterative, self-feedback-based RL for advancing verifiable mathematical reasoning."}

Existing approaches largely fall into two paradigms: unified embedding retrieval, which suffers from single-model myopia, and heuristic agentic retrieval, which is limited by suboptimal, trial-and-error orchestration. To this end, we propose OSCAR, an optimization-steered agentic planning framework for composed image retrieval. We are the first to reformulate agentic CIR from a heuristic search process into a principled trajectory optimization problem. Instead of relying on heuristic trial-and-error exploration, OSCAR employs a novel offline-online paradigm. In the offline phase, we model CIR via atomic retrieval selection and composition as a two-stage mixed-integer programming problem, mathematically deriving optimal trajectories that maximize ground-truth coverage for training samples via rigorous boolean set operations. These trajectories are then stored in a golden library to serve as in-context demonstrations for online steering of VLM planner at online inference time. Extensive experiments on three public benchmarks and a private industrial benchmark show that OSCAR consistently outperforms SOTA baselines. Notably, it achieves superior performance using only 10% of training data, demonstrating strong generalization of planning logic rather than dataset-specific memorization."}

Current LLM research is dominated by a paradigm that relies heavily on unidirectional scaling of data size, increasingly encountering bottlenecks in data availability, acquisition cost, and training efficiency. In this work, we argue that the development of AGI is entering a new phase of data-model co-evolution, in which models actively guide data management while high-quality data, in turn, amplifies model capabilities. To implement this vision, we propose a tiered data management framework, designed to support the full LLM training lifecycle across heterogeneous learning objectives and cost constraints. Specifically, we introduce an L0-L4 tiered data management framework, ranging from raw uncurated resources to organized and verifiable knowledge. Importantly, LLMs are fully used in data management processes, such as quality scoring and content editing, to refine data across tiers. Each tier is characterized by distinct data properties, management strategies, and training roles, enabling data to be strategically allocated across LLM training stages, including pre-training, mid-training, and alignment. The framework balances data quality, acquisition cost, and marginal training benefit, providing a systematic approach to scalable and sustainable data management. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework through empirical studies, in which tiered datasets are constructed from raw corpora and used across multiple training phases. Experimental results demonstrate that tier-aware data utilization significantly improves training efficiency and model performance. To facilitate further research, we release our tiered datasets and processing tools to the community."}

Previous work has established what problems debate can solve in principle, but has not analysed the practical cost of human oversight: how many queries must the judge make to the debate transcript? We introduce Debate Query Complexity}(DQC), the minimum number of bits a verifier must inspect to correctly decide a debate.\n  Surprisingly, we find that PSPACE/poly (the class of problems which debate can efficiently decide) is precisely the class of functions decidable with O(log n) queries. This characterisation shows that debate is remarkably query-efficient: even for highly complex problems, logarithmic oversight suffices. We also establish that functions depending on all their input bits require Omega(log n) queries, and that any function computable by a circuit of size s satisfies DQC(f) <= log(s) + 3. Interestingly, this last result implies that proving DQC lower bounds of log(n) + 6 for languages in P would yield new circuit lower bounds, connecting debate query complexity to central questions in circuit complexity."}

To address this gap, we introduce GEBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating dynamic interaction and temporal coherence in GUI generation. GEBench comprises 700 carefully curated samples spanning five task categories, covering both single-step interactions and multi-step trajectories across real-world and fictional scenarios, as well as grounding point localization. To support systematic evaluation, we propose GE-Score, a novel five-dimensional metric that assesses Goal Achievement, Interaction Logic, Content Consistency, UI Plausibility, and Visual Quality. Extensive evaluations on current models indicate that while they perform well on single-step transitions, they struggle significantly with maintaining temporal coherence and spatial grounding over longer interaction sequences. Our findings identify icon interpretation, text rendering, and localization precision as critical bottlenecks.

This issue is leading to an active, lively and on-going debate amongst the data-science community as well as amongst legal scholars. Where claims and results across both sides are often interpreted in different ways and leading to different implications. Our position is that much of the technical literature relies on traditional reconstruction techniques that are not designed for copyright analysis. As a result, memorization and copying have been conflated across both technical and legal communities and in multiple contexts. We argue that memorization, as commonly studied in data science, should not be equated with copying and should not be used as a proxy for copyright infringement. We distinguish technical signals that meaningfully indicate infringement risk from those that instead reflect lawful generalization or high-frequency content. Based on this analysis, we advocate for an output-level, risk-based evaluation process that aligns technical assessments with established copyright standards and provides a more principled foundation for research, auditing, and policy."}

Drawing on critical discourse analysis, we analyze a corpus of corporate safety-related statements to explicate how authority, responsibility, and legitimacy are discursively established. These discursive strategies consolidate legitimacy for corporate actors, normalize safety as an experimental and anticipatory practice, and push a perceived participatory agenda toward safe technologies. We argue that uncritical uptake of these discourses risks reproducing corporate priorities and constraining alternative approaches to governance and design. The contribution of this work is twofold: first, to situate safety as a sociotechnical discourse that warrants critical examination; second, to caution human-computer interaction scholars against legitimizing corporate framings, instead foregrounding accountability, equity, and justice. By interrogating safety discourses as artifacts of power, this paper advances a critical agenda for human-computer interaction scholarship on artificial intelligence."}

We derive the transient and steady-state solutions using two distinct but related approaches: a general resolvent-based method applicable to agents with heterogeneous susceptibilities, and a spectral method valid for the special case of homogeneous susceptibility. We further establish quantitative convergence rates to the steady state, derive explicit sensitivity formulas with respect to susceptibility parameters, and prove perturbation bounds under changes in the influence matrix.

Existing fairness assessments are typically conducted by AI experts or regulators using predefined protected attributes and metrics, which often fail to capture the diversity and nuance of fairness notions held by the individuals who are affected by these systems' decisions, such as decision subjects. Recent work has therefore called for involving affected individuals in fairness assessment, yet little empirical evidence exists on how they create their own fairness criteria or what kinds of criteria they produce - knowledge that could not only inform experts' fairness evaluation and mitigation, but also guide the design of AI assessment tools. We address this gap through a qualitative user study with 18 participants in a credit rating scenario. Participants first articulated their fairness notions in their own words. Then, participants turned them into concrete quantified and operationalized fairness criteria, through an interactive prototype we designed. Our findings provide empirical evidence of the process through which people's fairness notions emerge via grounding in model features, and uncover a diverse set of individuals' custom-defined criteria for both outcome and procedural fairness.

While regulatory and policy frameworks tend to define trust in normative terms, the trust users place in chatbots often emerges from behavioral mechanisms. In many cases, this trust is not earned through demonstrated trustworthiness but is instead shaped by interactional design choices that leverage cognitive biases to influence user behavior. Based on this observation, we propose reframing chatbots not as companions or assistants, but as highly skilled salespeople whose objectives are determined by the deploying organization. We argue that the coexistence of competing notions of \"trust\" under a shared term obscures important distinctions between psychological trust formation and normative trustworthiness. Addressing this gap requires further research and stronger support mechanisms to help users appropriately calibrate trust in conversational AI systems."}

It offers promising results in both data protection plus algorithmic fairness. This research addresses the critical need for sustainable data protection in the era of ever evolving cyber threats. Traditional encryption methods face limitations in handling the dynamic nature of environmental data. This necessitates the exploration of advanced cryptographic techniques. The objective of this study is to evaluate how AI can enhance these techniques to ensure robust data protection while facilitating fair algorithmic management. The methodology involves a comprehensive review of current advancements in AI-enhanced homomorphic encryption (HE) and multi-party computation (MPC). It is coupled with an analysis of how these techniques can be applied to environmental data regulation. Key findings indicate that AI-driven dynamic key management, adaptive encryption schemes, and optimized computational efficiency in HE, alongside AI-enhanced protocol optimization and fault mitigation in MPC, significantly improve the security of environmental data processing. These findings highlight a crucial research gap in the intersection of AI, cyber laws, and environmental regulation, particularly in terms of addressing algorithmic bias, transparency, and accountability.

This diversity highlights the complexity of the XAI evaluation, which, unlike traditional AI assessment, lacks a universally correct ground truth for the explanation, making objective evaluation challenging. One promising direction to address this issue involves the use of what we term Synthetic Artificial Intelligence Ground truth (SAIG) methods, which generate artificial ground truths to enable the direct evaluation of XAI techniques. This paper presents the first review and analysis of SAIG methods. We introduce a novel taxonomy to classify these approaches, identifying seven key features that distinguish different SAIG methods. Our comparative study reveals a concerning lack of consensus on the most effective XAI evaluation techniques, underscoring the need for further research and standardization in this area."}

This paper documents how excellence has become decoupled from knowledge production through an increasing coupling to representability under evaluation. The discussion focuses on two domains in which this is particularly visible: competitive basic research funding and large EU consortium projects. Three accelerating trends are examined: the professionalization of proposal writing through specialized consultants, the rise of AI-assisted applications, and an evaluator shortage that forces panels to rely on reviewers increasingly distant from the actual research domains.

Yet despite this enthusiasm, we still know surprisingly little about how AI actually takes shape inside different layers of government. Especially in federal systems where authority is fragmented across multiple levels. In practice, the same algorithm can serve very different purposes. This study responds to that gap by examining how AI is used across federal, state, and municipal levels in the United States. Drawing on a comparative qualitative analysis of thirty AI implementation cases, and guided by a digital-era governance framework combined with a sociotechnical perspective, the study identifies two broad modes of algorithmic governance: control-oriented systems and support-oriented systems. The findings reveal a clear pattern of functional differentiation across levels of government. At the federal level, AI is most often institutionalized as a tool for high-stakes control: supporting surveillance, enforcement, and regulatory oversight. State governments occupy a more ambiguous middle ground, where AI frequently combines supportive functions with algorithmic gatekeeping, particularly in areas such as welfare administration and public health. Municipal governments, by contrast, tend to deploy AI in more pragmatic and service-oriented ways, using it to streamline everyday operations and improve direct interactions with residents. By foregrounding institutional context, this study advances debates on algorithmic governance by demonstrating that the character, function, and risks of AI in the public sector are fundamentally shaped by the level of governance at which these systems are deployed."}

However, existing GDA methods typically assume that both source and target graphs exhibit homophily, leading existing methods to perform poorly when heterophily is present. Furthermore, the lack of labels in the target graph makes it impossible to assess its homophily level beforehand. To address this challenge, we propose a novel homophily-agnostic approach that effectively transfers knowledge between graphs with varying degrees of homophily. Specifically, we adopt a divide-and-conquer strategy that first separately reconstructs highly homophilic and heterophilic variants of both the source and target graphs, and then performs knowledge alignment separately between corresponding graph variants. Extensive experiments conducted on five benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our approach, particularly highlighting its substantial advantages on heterophilic graphs."}

Despite recent advances, the scalability of existing POMDP solvers remains limited. Moreover, many settings require a policy that is robust across multiple POMDPs, further aggravating the scalability issue. We propose the Lexpop framework for POMDP solving. Lexpop (1) employs deep reinforcement learning to train a neural policy, represented by a recurrent neural network, and (2) constructs a finite-state controller mimicking the neural policy through efficient extraction methods. Crucially, unlike neural policies, such controllers can be formally evaluated, providing performance guarantees. We extend Lexpop to compute robust policies for hidden-model POMDPs (HM-POMDPs), which describe finite sets of POMDPs. We associate every extracted controller with its worst-case POMDP. Using a set of such POMDPs, we iteratively train a robust neural policy and consequently extract a robust controller. Our experiments show that on problems with large state spaces, Lexpop outperforms state-of-the-art solvers for POMDPs as well as HM-POMDPs."}

This issue is leading to an active, lively and on-going debate amongst the data-science community as well as amongst legal scholars. Where claims and results across both sides are often interpreted in different ways and leading to different implications. Our position is that much of the technical literature relies on traditional reconstruction techniques that are not designed for copyright analysis. As a result, memorization and copying have been conflated across both technical and legal communities and in multiple contexts. We argue that memorization, as commonly studied in data science, should not be equated with copying and should not be used as a proxy for copyright infringement. We distinguish technical signals that meaningfully indicate infringement risk from those that instead reflect lawful generalization or high-frequency content. Based on this analysis, we advocate for an output-level, risk-based evaluation process that aligns technical assessments with established copyright standards and provides a more principled foundation for research, auditing, and policy."}

In this paper, we view latent chain-of-thought as a manipulable causal process in representation space by modeling latent steps as variables in a structural causal model (SCM) and analyzing their effects through step-wise $\\mathrm{do}$-interventions. We study two representative paradigms (i.e., Coconut and CODI) on both mathematical and general reasoning tasks to investigate three key questions: (1) which steps are causally necessary for correctness and when answers become decidable early; (2) how does influence propagate across steps, and how does this structure compare to explicit CoT; and (3) do intermediate trajectories retain competing answer modes, and how does output-level commitment differ from representational commitment across steps. We find that latent-step budgets behave less like homogeneous extra depth and more like staged functionality with non-local routing, and we identify a persistent gap between early output bias and late representational commitment. These results motivate mode-conditional and stability-aware analyses -- and corresponding training/decoding objectives -- as more reliable tools for interpreting and improving latent reasoning systems."}

While diffusion models (DM) have recently gained attention for their ability to capture complex predictive distributions, two gaps remain: (i) the generative path is conditioned only on positive evidence, overlooking informative negative context, and (ii) training objectives are dominated by cross-entropy ranking, which improves candidate ordering but provides little supervision over the calibration of the denoised embedding. To bridge this gap, we introduce Negative-Aware Diffusion model for TKG Extrapolation (NADEx). Specifically, NADEx encodes subject-centric histories of entities, relations and temporal intervals into sequential embeddings. NADEx perturbs the query object in the forward process and reconstructs it in reverse with a Transformer denoiser conditioned on the temporal-relational context. We further derive a cosine-alignment regularizer derived from batch-wise negative prototypes, which tightens the decision boundary against implausible candidates. Comprehensive experiments on four public TKG benchmarks demonstrate that NADEx delivers state-of-the-art performance."}

This framework makes it possible to reason in the context of each of these combinations and extensions, but also to study in a unified way the satisfiability decision and its complexity. In particular, we establish two complementary theorems guaranteeing that the satisfiability decision is polynomial, and we use them to recover the known results of the size-topology combination.

We propose Scalable Delphi, adapting the classical protocol for LLMs with diverse expert personas, iterative refinement, and rationale sharing. Because target quantities are typically unobservable, we develop an evaluation framework based on necessary conditions: calibration against verifiable proxies, sensitivity to evidence, and alignment with human expert judgment. We evaluate in the domain of AI-augmented cybersecurity risk, using three capability benchmarks and independent human elicitation studies. LLM panels achieve strong correlations with benchmark ground truth (Pearson r=0.87-0.95), improve systematically as evidence is added, and align with human expert panels - in one comparison, closer to a human panel than the two human panels are to each other. This demonstrates that LLM-based elicitation can extend structured expert judgment to settings where traditional methods are infeasible, reducing elicitation time from months to minutes."}

To address these limitations, we introduce the Intelligent Virtual Situation Room (IVSR), a bidirectional Digital Twin (DT) platform augmented by autonomous AI agents. The IVSR continuously ingests multisource sensor imagery, weather data, and 3D forest models to create a live virtual replica of the fire environment. A similarity engine powered by AI aligns emerging conditions with a precomputed Disaster Simulation Library, retrieving and calibrating intervention tactics under the watchful eyes of experts. Authorized action-ranging from UAV redeployment to crew reallocation-is cycled back through standardized procedures to the physical layer, completing the loop between response and analysis.

We study networks that achieve random-order asymptotic truth learning, in which almost all agents learn the ground truth when the decision ordering is selected uniformly at random. We analyze the robustness of these networks, showing that those achieving random-order asymptotic truth learning are resilient to a bounded number of adversarial modifications. We characterize necessary conditions for such networks to succeed in this setting and introduce several graph constructions that learn through different mechanisms.

The main substitute being proposed is community-based contextualization, most notably Community Notes on X, where users write annotations and collectively rate their helpfulness under a consensus-oriented algorithm. This shift raises a basic empirical question: to what extent do users' social dynamics affect the emergence of Community Notes? We address this question by characterizing participation and political behavior, using the full public release of notes and ratings (between 2021 and 2025). We show that contribution activity is highly concentrated: a small minority of users accounts for a disproportionate share of ratings. Crucially, these high-activity contributors are not neutral volunteers: they are selective in the content they engage with and substantially more politically polarized than the overall contributor population. We replicate the notes' emergence process by integrating the open-source implementation of the Community Notes consensus algorithm used in production. This enables us to conduct counterfactual simulations that modify the display status of notes by varying the pool of raters. Our results reveal that the system is structurally unstable: the emergence and visibility of notes often depend on the behavior of a few dozen highly active users, and even minor perturbations in their participation can lead to markedly different outcomes. In sum, rather than decentralizing epistemic authority, community-based fact-checking on X reconfigures it, concentrating substantial power in the hands of a small, polarized group of highly active contributors."}

The system is built on a structured architecture composed of three coordinated subsystems for generation, verification, and evolution. These subsystems are supported by foundational capabilities for deep research, solution optimization, and long horizon memory. The architecture allows InternAgent-1.5 to operate continuously across extended discovery cycles while maintaining coherent and improving behavior. It also enables the system to coordinate computational modeling and laboratory experimentation within a single unified system. We evaluate InternAgent-1.5 on scientific reasoning benchmarks such as GAIA, HLE, GPQA, and FrontierScience, and the system achieves leading performance that demonstrates strong foundational capabilities. Beyond these benchmarks, we further assess two categories of discovery tasks. In algorithm discovery tasks, InternAgent-1.5 autonomously designs competitive methods for core machine learning problems. In empirical discovery tasks, it executes complete computational or wet lab experiments and produces scientific findings in earth, life, biological, and physical domains. Overall, these results show that InternAgent-1.5 provides a general and scalable framework for autonomous scientific discovery."}

Clinical notes capture a patient's private vulnerability and individuality, which are used for care coordination and research. Under HIPAA Safe Harbor, these notes are de-identified to protect patient privacy. However, Safe Harbor was designed for an era of categorical tabular data, focusing on the removal of explicit identifiers while ignoring the latent information found in correlations between identity and quasi-identifiers, which can be captured by modern LLMs. We first formalize these correlations using a causal graph, then validate it empirically through individual re-identification of patients from scrubbed notes. The paradox of de-identification is further shown through a diagnosis ablation: even when all other information is removed, the model can predict the patient's neighborhood based on diagnosis alone. This position paper raises the question of how we can act as a community to uphold patient-provider trust when de-identification is inherently imperfect. We aim to raise awareness and discuss actionable recommendations."}

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a framework for aligning these models with task-specific rewards, improving overall quality and reliability. Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is an efficient, value-function-free alternative to Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) that leverages group-relative reward normalization. We introduce Iterative Group Relative Policy Optimization (iGRPO), a two-stage extension of GRPO that adds dynamic self-conditioning through model-generated drafts. In Stage 1, iGRPO samples multiple exploratory drafts and selects the highest-reward draft using the same scalar reward signal used for optimization. In Stage 2, it appends this best draft to the original prompt and applies a GRPO-style update on draft-conditioned refinements, training the policy to improve beyond its strongest prior attempt. Under matched rollout budgets, iGRPO consistently outperforms GRPO across base models (e.g., Nemotron-H-8B-Base-8K and DeepSeek-R1 Distilled), validating its effectiveness on diverse reasoning benchmarks. Moreover, applying iGRPO to OpenReasoning-Nemotron-7B trained on AceReason-Math achieves new state-of-the-art results of 85.62\\% and 79.64\\% on AIME24 and AIME25, respectively. Ablations further show that the refinement wrapper generalizes beyond GRPO variants, benefits from a generative judge, and alters learning dynamics by delaying entropy collapse. These results underscore the potential of iterative, self-feedback-based RL for advancing verifiable mathematical reasoning."}

Current LLM research is dominated by a paradigm that relies heavily on unidirectional scaling of data size, increasingly encountering bottlenecks in data availability, acquisition cost, and training efficiency. In this work, we argue that the development of AGI is entering a new phase of data-model co-evolution, in which models actively guide data management while high-quality data, in turn, amplifies model capabilities. To implement this vision, we propose a tiered data management framework, designed to support the full LLM training lifecycle across heterogeneous learning objectives and cost constraints. Specifically, we introduce an L0-L4 tiered data management framework, ranging from raw uncurated resources to organized and verifiable knowledge. Importantly, LLMs are fully used in data management processes, such as quality scoring and content editing, to refine data across tiers. Each tier is characterized by distinct data properties, management strategies, and training roles, enabling data to be strategically allocated across LLM training stages, including pre-training, mid-training, and alignment. The framework balances data quality, acquisition cost, and marginal training benefit, providing a systematic approach to scalable and sustainable data management. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework through empirical studies, in which tiered datasets are constructed from raw corpora and used across multiple training phases. Experimental results demonstrate that tier-aware data utilization significantly improves training efficiency and model performance. To facilitate further research, we release our tiered datasets and processing tools to the community."}

However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on general domain visual fidelity, leaving the evaluation of state transitions and temporal coherence in GUI-specific contexts underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce GEBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating dynamic interaction and temporal coherence in GUI generation. GEBench comprises 700 carefully curated samples spanning five task categories, covering both single-step interactions and multi-step trajectories across real-world and fictional scenarios, as well as grounding point localization. To support systematic evaluation, we propose GE-Score, a novel five-dimensional metric that assesses Goal Achievement, Interaction Logic, Content Consistency, UI Plausibility, and Visual Quality. Extensive evaluations on current models indicate that while they perform well on single-step transitions, they struggle significantly with maintaining temporal coherence and spatial grounding over longer interaction sequences. Our findings identify icon interpretation, text rendering, and localization precision as critical bottlenecks. This work provides a foundation for systematic assessment and suggests promising directions for future research toward building high-fidelity generative GUI environments.

It has been applied to wide applications, including the measure of the severity of the infection, the estimation of the number of infected cases, risk assessment etc. However, there remains a lack of understanding on several aspects of CFR, including population factors that are important to CFR, the apparent discrepancy of CFRs in different countries, and how the age effect comes into play. We analyze the CFRs at two different time snapshots, July 6 and Dec 28, 2020, with one during the first wave and the other a second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. We consider two important population covariates, age and GDP as a proxy for the quality and abundance of public health. Extensive exploratory data analysis leads to some interesting findings. First, there is a clear exponential age effect among different age groups, and, more importantly, the exponential index is almost invariant across countries and time in the pandemic. Second, the roles played by the age and GDP are a little surprising: during the first wave, age is a more significant factor than GDP, while their roles have switched during the second wave of the pandemic, which may be partially explained by the delay in time for the quality and abundance of public health and medical research to factor in."}

We derive analytical sensitivity expressions for the Jacobian of the individual optimal PURC flow and equilibrium link flows with respect to link cost parameters under general assumptions. This allows us to determine the marginal change in link flows following a marginal change in link costs across the network. We show how to implement these results while exploiting the sparsity generated by the PURC model. Numerical examples illustrate the use of our method for estimating equilibrium link flows after link cost shifts, identifying critical design parameters, and quantifying uncertainty in performance predictions. Finally, we demonstrate the method in a large-scale example. The findings have implications for network design, pricing strategies, and policy analysis in transportation planning and economics, providing a bridge between theoretical models and real-world applications."}
