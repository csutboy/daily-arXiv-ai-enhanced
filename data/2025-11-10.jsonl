Understanding how different populations respond to information is\ncrucial for designing effective interventions, yet real-world experimentation\nis impractical and ethically challenging.

Existing approaches\neither solely depend on rule-based constraints or exclusively utilize deep\nlearning technologies to identify target communities. Therefore, an important\nquestion is proposed: can deep learning be integrated with rule-based\nconstraints to elevate the quality of community search? In this paper, we\naffirmatively address this question by introducing a novel approach called\nNeural Community Search via Attribute-augmented Conductance, abbreviated as\nNCSAC. Specifically, NCSAC first proposes a novel concept of\nattribute-augmented conductance, which harmoniously blends the (internal and\nexternal) structural proximity and the attribute similarity. Then, NCSAC\nextracts a coarse candidate community of satisfactory quality using the\nproposed attribute-augmented conductance. Subsequently, NCSAC frames the\ncommunity search as a graph optimization task, refining the candidate community\nthrough sophisticated reinforcement learning techniques, thereby producing\nhigh-quality results. Extensive experiments on six real-world graphs and ten\ncompetitors demonstrate the superiority of our solutions in terms of accuracy,\nefficiency, and scalability.

Altering a PCM cell's state during writes demands substantial\nenergy, posing a significant challenge to PCM's role as the primary main\nmemory. Prior research has explored methods to reduce write energy consumption,\nincluding the elimination of redundant writes, minimizing cell writes, and\nemploying compact row buffers for filtering PCM main memory accesses. However,\nthese techniques had certain drawbacks like bit-wise comparison of the stored\nvalues, preemptive updates increasing write cycles, and poor endurance.

Traditional electromagnetic transient models (EMT),\nwhile effective, face scalability challenges due to their reliance on detailed\nsystem information. Data-driven approaches, such as System Identification\n(SysID), offer a promising alternative by modeling system dynamics without\ndetailed system knowledge. However, SysID and similar methods are\ncomputationally intensive, requiring the computation of complex ordinary\ndifferential equations (ODEs) or transfer functions estimation.

We therefore propose a novel\ndata-driven approach that simplifies the modeling of DERs dynamics by\nleveraging B-splines to transform discrete system data into continuous\ndifferentiable functions. This enables the estimation of lower order linear\nordinary differential equations with simple linear regression to represent the\nunderlying dynamics at a very low computational cost. Furthermore, the\nextracted dynamic equations are discretized by the backward Euler method for\npotential integration into discrete-time power dispatch models.

Sample-splitting attains valid inference on model properties by using\nseparate subsamples to estimate the model and to evaluate it. However, this\napproach has two drawbacks, since each task uses only part of the data, and\ndifferent splits can lead to widely different estimates. Averaging across\nmultiple splits, I develop an inference approach that uses more data for\ntraining, uses the entire sample for testing, and improves reproducibility. I\naddress the statistical dependence from reusing observations across splits by\nproving a new central limit theorem for a large class of split-sample\nestimators under arguably mild and general conditions. Importantly, I make no\nrestrictions on model complexity or convergence rates. I show that confidence\nintervals based on the normal approximation are valid for many applications,\nbut may undercover in important cases of interest, such as comparing the\nperformance between two models. I develop a new inference approach for such\ncases, explicitly accounting for the dependence across splits. Moreover, I\nprovide a measure of reproducibility for p-values obtained from split-sample\nestimators. Finally, I apply my results to two important problems in\ndevelopment and public economics: predicting poverty and learning heterogeneous\ntreatment effects in randomized experiments.

Traditional electromagnetic transient models (EMT),\nwhile effective, face scalability challenges due to their reliance on detailed\nsystem information. Data-driven approaches, such as System Identification\n(SysID), offer a promising alternative by modeling system dynamics without\ndetailed system knowledge. However, SysID and similar methods are\ncomputationally intensive, requiring the computation of complex ordinary\ndifferential equations (ODEs) or transfer functions estimation. This makes them\nless effective for real-time operation. We therefore propose a novel\ndata-driven approach that simplifies the modeling of DERs dynamics by\nleveraging B-splines to transform discrete system data into continuous\ndifferentiable functions. This enables the estimation of lower order linear\nordinary differential equations with simple linear regression to represent the\nunderlying dynamics at a very low computational cost. Furthermore, the\nextracted dynamic equations are discretized by the backward Euler method for\npotential integration into discrete-time power dispatch models. Validation\nresults indicate a goodness-of-fit (GoF) of 98.74%, comparable to the 99.03%\nGoF of the SysID method, yet, 4.8 times faster.

Beyond physics and rendering, the\nframework integrates actuator models, multi-frequency sensor simulation, data\ncollection pipelines, and domain randomization tools, unifying best practices\nfor reinforcement and imitation learning at scale within a single extensible\nplatform. We highlight its application to a diverse set of challenges,\nincluding whole-body control, cross-embodiment mobility, contact-rich and\ndexterous manipulation, and the integration of human demonstrations for skill\nacquisition.

To address this problem, we propose a\nnovel Dual-Actor Policy, termed DAP, which explicitly considers different\nstages and leverages heterogeneous visual priors to enhance each stage.\nSpecifically, we introduce an affordance-based actor to locate the functional\npart in the manipulation task, thereby improving the approaching process.\nFollowing this, we propose a motion flow-based actor to capture the movement of\nthe component, facilitating the manipulation process.

These capabilities are mostly driven by large-scale pre-trained\nfoundation models (FMs). However, the approaches with which these models are\ngrounded for human-robot interaction (HRI) perpetuate a master-apprentice\nmodel, where the apprentice (embodied agent) passively receives and executes\nthe master's (human's) commands without reciprocal learning. This reactive\ninteraction approach does not capture the co-adaptive dynamics inherent in\neveryday multi-turn human-human interactions. To address this, we propose a\nSymbiotic Interactive Learning (SIL) approach that enables both the master and\nthe apprentice to co-adapt through mutual, bidirectional interactions. We\nformalised SIL as a co-adaptation process within a shared latent task space,\nwhere the agent and human maintain joint belief states that evolve based on\ninteraction history. This enables the agent to move beyond reactive execution\nto proactive clarification, adaptive suggestions, and shared plan refinement.\nTo realise these novel behaviours, we leveraged pre-trained FMs for spatial\nperception and reasoning, alongside a lightweight latent encoder that grounds\nthe models' outputs into task-specific representations. Furthermore, to ensure\nstability as the tasks evolve, we augment SIL with a memory architecture that\nprevents the forgetting of learned task-space representations.

Without\nthis information, these models fail to infer, e.g., material properties.\nFurther, they rely on auto-regressive rollouts, which quickly accumulate error\nfor long trajectories. We instead frame mesh-based simulation as a\ntrajectory-level meta-learning problem. Using Conditional Neural Processes, our\nmethod enables rapid adaptation to new simulation scenarios from limited\ninitial data while capturing their latent simulation properties. We utilize\nmovement primitives to directly predict fast, stable and accurate simulations\nfrom a single model call. The resulting approach, Movement-primitive\nMeta-MeshGraphNet (M3GN), provides higher simulation accuracy at a fraction of\nthe runtime cost compared to state-of-the-art GNSs across several tasks."}

A ranking task for instructional\nsupport materials showed a strong preference for interactive demonstrations\nover traditional educational materials like conceptual guides or lecture\nslides.\n  These findings offer insights into instructor perspectives on making AI\nconcepts more accessible and relevant for broad learner audiences. They also\ninform the design of AI literacy tools that align with diverse teaching\ncontexts and support critical engagement with AI in higher education."}

The next frontier is\nAI-assisted decision-making: agents that recommend sites, allocate resources,\nand evaluate trade-offs while reasoning transparently about constraints and\nstakeholder values. Recent breakthroughs in reasoning AI -- CoT prompting,\nReAct, and multi-agent collaboration frameworks -- now make this vision\nachievable.\n  This position paper presents the Agentic Urban Planning AI Framework for\nreasoning-capable planning agents that integrates three cognitive layers\n(Perception, Foundation, Reasoning) with six logic components (Analysis,\nGeneration, Verification, Evaluation, Collaboration, Decision) through a\nmulti-agents collaboration framework. We demonstrate why planning decisions\nrequire explicit reasoning capabilities that are value-based (applying\nnormative principles), rule-grounded (guaranteeing constraint satisfaction),\nand explainable (generating transparent justifications) -- requirements that\nstatistical learning alone cannot fulfill. We compare reasoning agents with\nstatistical learning, present a comprehensive architecture with benchmark\nevaluation metrics, and outline critical research challenges. This framework\nshows how AI agents can augment human planners by systematically exploring\nsolution spaces, verifying regulatory compliance, and deliberating over\ntrade-offs transparently -- not replacing human judgment but amplifying it with\ncomputational reasoning capabilities."}

The system integrates a torque-controlled robotic\nmanipulator with interchangeable passive props (silicone hand replicas and a\nbaton), marker-based physical-virtual registration via a ChArUco board, and a\nsafety monitor that gates motion based on the user's head and hand pose. We\nintroduce two control strategies: (i) a static mode that presents a stationary\nprop aligned with its virtual counterpart, consistent with prior ETHD\nbaselines, and (ii) a dynamic mode that continuously updates prop position by\nexponentially blending an initial mid-point trajectory with real-time hand\ntracking, generating a unique contact point for each interaction. Bench tests\nshow static colocation accuracy of 5.09 +/- 0.94 mm, while user interactions\nachieved temporal alignment with an average contact latency of 28.53 +/- 31.21\nms across all interaction and control conditions. These results demonstrate the\nfeasibility of recreating socially meaningful haptics in VR.

Using the equivalence\nof the Complex Frequency (CF) of the injected currents as the definition for\ncoherency among devices, the control enforces an output current with a\nproportional magnitude and a constant phase shift relative to a reference. This\nformulation makes the control technology-agnostic, enabling coherency with any\ntype of resource.

We model the robot as a\nSpring-loaded Inverted Pendulum (SLIP), a model well-suited to represent the\nbouncing motion characteristic of running gaits observed in various biological\nquadrupeds and bio-inspired robotic systems. The model permits leg-orientation\ncontrol during flight and leg-length control during stance, a design choice\ninspired by natural quadruped behaviors and prevalent in robotic quadruped\nsystems. Our control algorithm uses the reduced-order SLIP dynamics of the\nquadruped to track a stable parabolic spline during stance, which is calculated\nusing the principle of energy conservation. Through simulations based on the\ndesign specifications of an actual quadruped robot, Ghost Robotics Minitaur, we\ndemonstrate that our control algorithm generates stable bouncing gaits.\nAdditionally, we illustrate the robustness of our controller by showcasing its\nability to maintain stable bouncing even when faced with up to a 10% error in\nsensor measurements."}

In contrast, conventional quadrotor designs rely\non rigid frames that support agile flight but inherently limit collision\nresilience and squeezability, thereby constraining flight capabilities in\ncluttered environments. Inspired by the anisotropic stiffness and distributed\nmass-energy structures observed in biological organisms, we introduce\nFlexiQuad, a soft-frame quadrotor design approach that limits this trade-off.\nWe demonstrate a 405-gram FlexiQuad prototype, three orders of magnitude more\ncompliant than conventional quadrotors, yet capable of acrobatic manoeuvres\nwith peak speeds above 80 km/h and linear and angular accelerations exceeding 3\ng and 300 rad/s$^2$, respectively. Analysis demonstrates it can replicate\naccelerations of rigid counterparts up to a thrust-to-weight ratio of 8.\nSimultaneously, FlexiQuad exhibits fourfold higher collision resilience,\nsurviving frontal impacts at 5 m/s without damage and reducing destabilising\nforces in glancing collisions by a factor of 39. Its frame can fully compress,\nenabling flight through gaps as narrow as 70% of its nominal width. Our\nanalysis identifies an optimal structural softness range, from 0.006 to 0.77\nN/mm, comparable to that of natural flyers' wings, whereby agility,\nsqueezability, and collision resilience are jointly achieved for FlexiQuad\nmodels from 20 to 3000 grams. FlexiQuad expands hovering drone capabilities in\ncomplex environments, enabling robust physical interactions without\ncompromising flight performance."}

This paper presents findings from a study of AI User, a modular,\nweb-based curriculum that teaches core AI concepts through interactive, no-code\nprojects grounded in real-world scenarios. The curriculum includes eight\nprojects; this study focuses on instructor feedback on Projects 5-8, which\naddress applied topics such as natural language processing, computer vision,\ndecision support, and responsible AI. Fifteen community college instructors\nparticipated in structured focus groups, completing the projects as learners\nand providing feedback through individual reflection and group discussion.\nUsing thematic analysis, we examined how instructors evaluated the design,\ninstructional value, and classroom applicability of these experiential\nactivities. Findings highlight instructors' appreciation for exploratory tasks,\nrole-based simulations, and real-world relevance, while also surfacing design\ntrade-offs around cognitive load, guidance, and adaptability for diverse\nlearners.

However, prevailing definitions and\ntherefore assessments of AI literacy often emphasize foundational technical\nknowledge, such as programming, mathematics, and statistics, over practical\nknowledge such as interpreting model outputs, selecting tools, or identifying\nethical concerns. This leaves a noticeable gap in assessing someone's AI\nliteracy for real-world job use. We propose a work-task-oriented assessment\nmodel for AI literacy which is grounded in the competencies required for\neffective use of AI tools in professional settings. We describe the development\nof a novel AI literacy assessment instrument, and accompanying formative\nassessments, in the context of a US Navy robotics training program. The program\nincluded training in robotics and AI literacy, as well as a competition with\npractical tasks and a multiple choice scenario task meant to simulate use of AI\nin a job setting. We found that, as a measure of applied AI literacy, the\ncompetition's scenario task outperformed the tests we adopted from past\nresearch or developed ourselves. We argue that when training people for\nAI-related work, educators should consider evaluating them with instruments\nthat emphasize highly contextualized practical skills rather than abstract\ntechnical knowledge, especially when preparing workers without technical\nbackgrounds for AI-integrated roles."}
