We propose an approach that integrates semantic camera data\nwith LiDAR segmentation to address this challenge. By projecting LiDAR points\ninto the semantic segmentation space of the camera, our method enhances the\nprecision and reliability of the LiDAR-based localization pipeline.\n  For validation, we utilize the CoCar NextGen platform from the FZI Research\nCenter for Information Technology, which offers diverse sensor modalities and\nconfigurations. The sensor setup of CoCar NextGen enables a thorough analysis\nof different sensor types. Our evaluation leverages the state-of-the-art\nDepth-Anything network for camera image segmentation and an adaptive\nsegmentation network for LiDAR segmentation. To establish a reliable ground\ntruth for LiDAR-based localization, we make us of a Global Navigation Satellite\nSystem (GNSS) solution with Real-Time Kinematic corrections (RTK).\nAdditionally, we conduct an extensive 55 km drive through the city of\nKarlsruhe, Germany, covering a variety of environments, including urban areas,\nmulti-lane roads, and rural highways. This multimodal approach paves the way\nfor more reliable and precise autonomous navigation systems, particularly in\ncomplex real-world environments."}

Inspired by the distal morphology of the\nAfrican elephant trunk, we present MELEGROS, a Monolithic ELEphant-inspired\nGRipper with Optical Sensors, emphasizing sensing as an intrinsic,\nco-fabricated capability. Unlike multi-material or tendon-based approaches,\nMELEGROS directly integrates six optical waveguide sensors and five pneumatic\nchambers into a pneumatically actuated lattice structure (12.5 mm cell size)\nusing a single soft resin and one continuous 3D print. This eliminates\nmechanical mismatches between sensors, actuators, and body, reducing model\nuncertainty and enabling simulation-guided sensor design and placement. Only\nfour iterations were required to achieve the final prototype, which features a\ncontinuous structure capable of elongation, compression, and bending while\ndecoupling tactile and proprioceptive signals. MELEGROS (132 g) lifts more than\ntwice its weight, performs bioinspired actions such as pinching, scooping, and\nreaching, and delicately grasps fragile items like grapes. The integrated\noptical sensors provide distinct responses to touch, bending, and chamber\ndeformation, enabling multifunctional perception.

Policies to reduce informality based solely on lowering\nformalization costs are largely ineffective, while increased enforcement at the\nextensive margin shows more promising results. The effects of the minimum wage\non employment, measured through the own-wage elasticity (OWE), are consistently\nmodest, suggesting that job losses are limited compared to wage gains.

Safely clearing a path on challenging terrain, such as a cluttered\nstaircase, requires controlled interaction. For example, a quadrupedal robot\nthat pushes objects out of the way with one leg while maintaining a stable\nstance with its three other legs. However, tightly coupled physical actions,\nsuch as one-legged pushing, create new constraints on the system that can be\ndifficult to predict at design time. In this work, we present a new method that\naddresses one such constraint, wherein the object being pushed by a quadrupedal\nrobot with one of its legs becomes occluded from the robot's sensors during\nmanipulation. To address this challenge, we present a tightly coupled\nperception-action framework that enables the robot to perceive clutter, reason\nabout feasible push paths, and execute the clearing maneuver. Our core\ncontribution is an interaction-aware state estimation loop that uses\nproprioceptive feedback regarding foot contact and leg position to predict an\nobject's displacement during the occlusion. This prediction guides the\nperception system to robustly re-detect the object after the interaction,\nclosing the loop between action and sensing to enable accurate tracking even\nafter partial pushes. Using this feedback allows the robot to learn from\nphysical outcomes, reclassifying an object as immovable if a push fails due to\nit being too heavy. We present results of implementing our approach on a Boston\nDynamics Spot robot that show our interaction-aware approach achieves higher\ntask success rates and tracking accuracy in pushing objects on stairs compared\nto open-loop baselines."}

Predictive modeling for TCI claims poses formidable challenges due\nto the data's complexity, yet remains underexplored in the literature.\nLeveraging six years of detailed TCI data from an Asian TCI insurer, we develop\na bivariate, network-augmented Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) to jointly\nmodel claim probability and reporting time gaps.

Our final TCI is constructed using the Entropy\nWeight Method, which objectively assigns weights to both dimensions based on\ntheir information entropy. To validate our approach, we compare the proposed\nTCI against established convergence measures, demonstrating its comparative\nadvantages. We further establish empirical reliability through a novel\nrobustness test that regresses TCI against indicators of patent quality.

Their growing use reflects the goal of combining\nmultiple models to improve accuracy and stability versus using a single model.\nHowever, recent experience shows these benefits are not guaranteed. During the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, the CDC's multi-model forecasting ensemble outperformed the\nbest single model by only 1%, and CDC flu forecasting ensembles have often\nranked below multiple individual models.\n  This raises a key question: why are ensembles underperforming? We posit that\na central reason is that both model developers and ensemble builders typically\nfocus on stand-alone accuracy. Models are fit to minimize their own forecasting\nerror, and ensembles are often weighted according to those same scores.\nHowever, most epidemic forecasts are built from a small set of approaches and\ntrained on the same surveillance data, leading to highly correlated errors.\nThis redundancy limits the benefit of ensembling and may explain why large\nensembles sometimes deliver only marginal gains.\n  To realize the potential of ensembles, both modelers and ensemblers should\nprioritize models that contribute complementary information rather than\nreplicating existing approaches.

However, even\nwell-trained policies remain vulnerable to collisions in obstacle-rich\nenvironments. Addressing these infrequent but critical safety failures through\nretraining or fine-tuning is costly and risks degrading previously learned\nskills. Inspired by activation steering in large language models and latent\nediting in computer vision, we introduce a framework for inference-time Latent\nActivation Editing (LAE) that refines the behavior of pre-trained policies\nwithout modifying their weights or architecture. The framework operates in two\nstages: (i) an online classifier monitors intermediate activations to detect\nstates associated with undesired behaviors, and (ii) an activation editing\nmodule that selectively modifies flagged activations to shift the policy\ntowards safer regimes. In this work, we focus on improving safety in\nmulti-quadrotor navigation. We hypothesize that amplifying a policy's internal\nperception of risk can induce safer behaviors. We instantiate this idea through\na latent collision world model trained to predict future pre-collision\nactivations, thereby prompting earlier and more cautious avoidance responses.\nExtensive simulations and real-world Crazyflie experiments demonstrate that LAE\nachieves statistically significant reduction in collisions (nearly 90% fewer\ncumulative collisions compared to the unedited baseline) and substantially\nincreases the fraction of collision-free trajectories, while preserving task\ncompletion. More broadly, our results establish LAE as a lightweight paradigm,\nfeasible on resource-constrained hardware, for post-deployment refinement of\nlearned robot policies."}

However, traditional approaches face significant\nchallenges when training Artificial Intelligence (AI) scheduling inferences\noffline, particularly due to the complexities involved in constructing a\ncomprehensive Multi-Schedule Graph (MSG) that accounts for all possible\nscenarios. The process of generating an MSG that captures the vast probability\nspace, especially when considering context events like hardware failures, slack\nvariations, or mode changes, is resource-intensive and often infeasible. To\naddress these challenges, we propose an adaptive online learning unit\nintegrated within the metascheduler to enhance performance in real-time.

This dynamic adaptation allows the\nsystem to handle unexpected events and complex scheduling scenarios more\neffectively. Several RL models were implemented within the online learning\nunit, each designed to address specific challenges in scheduling.

This anthropomorphic approach creates two critical barriers: 1) it\nlimits robotic capabilities to tasks humans can already perform, and 2) it\nmakes data collection for learning-based methods exceedingly difficult. Both\nchallenges are caused by traditional force-closure which requires coordinating\ncomplex, multi-point contacts based on friction, normal force, and gravity to\ngrasp an object. This makes teleoperated demonstrations unstable and amplifies\nthe sim-to-real gap for reinforcement learning. In this work, we propose a\nparadigm shift: moving away from replicating human mechanics toward the design\nof novel robotic embodiments. We introduce the \\textbf{S}uction\n\\textbf{Leap}-Hand (SLeap Hand), a multi-fingered hand featuring integrated\nfingertip suction cups that realize a new form of suction-enabled dexterity. By\nreplacing complex force-closure grasps with stable, single-point adhesion, our\ndesign fundamentally simplifies in-hand teleoperation and facilitates the\ncollection of high-quality demonstration data. More importantly, this\nsuction-based embodiment unlocks a new class of dexterous skills that are\ndifficult or even impossible for the human hand, such as one-handed paper\ncutting and in-hand writing. Our work demonstrates that by moving beyond\nanthropomorphic constraints, novel embodiments can not only lower the barrier\nfor collecting robust manipulation data but also enable the stable,\nsingle-handed completion of tasks that would typically require two human hands.\nOur webpage is https://sites.google.com/view/sleaphand."}

In this context, shared control refers\nto a driving mode where the human driver collaborates with an autonomous\ndriving system to control the steering of a vehicle simultaneously. Advanced\ndriving skills are those necessary to safely push the vehicle to its handling\nlimits in high-performance driving such as racing and emergency obstacle\navoidance. Previous research has demonstrated the performance and safety\nbenefits of shared control schemes using both subjective and objective\nevaluations. However, these schemes have not been assessed for their impact on\nskill acquisition on complex and demanding tasks. Prior research on long-term\nskill acquisition either applies haptic shared control to simple tasks or\nemploys other feedback methods like visual and auditory aids. To bridge this\ngap, this study creates a cyber racing coach framework based on the haptic\nshared control paradigm and evaluates its performance in helping human drivers\nacquire high-performance driving skills. The framework introduces (1) an\nautonomous driving system that is capable of cooperating with humans in a\nhighly performant driving scenario; and (2) a haptic shared control mechanism\nalong with a fading scheme to gradually reduce the steering assistance from\nautonomy based on the human driver's performance during training. Two\nbenchmarks are considered: self-learning (no assistance) and full assistance\nduring training. Results from a human subject study indicate that the proposed\nframework helps human drivers develop superior racing skills compared to the\nbenchmarks, resulting in better performance and consistency."}

Submitted to npj Digital Medicine", "summary": "Purpose: To develop a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system powered by\nLLaMA-4 109B for automated, protocol-aware, and interpretable evaluation of\nradiotherapy treatment plans.\n  Methods and Materials: We curated a multi-protocol dataset of 614\nradiotherapy plans across four disease sites and constructed a knowledge base\ncontaining normalized dose metrics and protocol-defined constraints. The RAG\nsystem integrates three core modules: a retrieval engine optimized across five\nSentenceTransformer backbones, a percentile prediction component based on\ncohort similarity, and a clinical constraint checker. These tools are directed\nby a large language model (LLM) using a multi-step prompt-driven reasoning\npipeline to produce concise, grounded evaluations.\n  Results: Retrieval hyperparameters were optimized using Gaussian Process on a\nscalarized loss function combining root mean squared error (RMSE), mean\nabsolute error (MAE), and clinically motivated accuracy thresholds. The best\nconfiguration, based on all-MiniLM-L6-v2, achieved perfect nearest-neighbor\naccuracy within a 5-percentile-point margin and a sub-2pt MAE. When tested\nend-to-end, the RAG system achieved 100% agreement with the computed values by\nstandalone retrieval and constraint-checking modules on both percentile\nestimates and constraint identification, confirming reliable execution of all\nretrieval, prediction and checking steps.\n  Conclusion: Our findings highlight the feasibility of combining structured\npopulation-based scoring with modular tool-augmented reasoning for transparent,\nscalable plan evaluation in radiation therapy. The system offers traceable\noutputs, minimizes hallucination, and demonstrates robustness across protocols.\nFuture directions include clinician-led validation, and improved domain-adapted\nretrieval models to enhance real-world integration."}

Safely clearing a path on challenging terrain, such as a cluttered\nstaircase, requires controlled interaction. For example, a quadrupedal robot\nthat pushes objects out of the way with one leg while maintaining a stable\nstance with its three other legs. However, tightly coupled physical actions,\nsuch as one-legged pushing, create new constraints on the system that can be\ndifficult to predict at design time. In this work, we present a new method that\naddresses one such constraint, wherein the object being pushed by a quadrupedal\nrobot with one of its legs becomes occluded from the robot's sensors during\nmanipulation. To address this challenge, we present a tightly coupled\nperception-action framework that enables the robot to perceive clutter, reason\nabout feasible push paths, and execute the clearing maneuver. Our core\ncontribution is an interaction-aware state estimation loop that uses\nproprioceptive feedback regarding foot contact and leg position to predict an\nobject's displacement during the occlusion. This prediction guides the\nperception system to robustly re-detect the object after the interaction,\nclosing the loop between action and sensing to enable accurate tracking even\nafter partial pushes. Using this feedback allows the robot to learn from\nphysical outcomes, reclassifying an object as immovable if a push fails due to\nit being too heavy.

CLAUSE employs the proposed Lagrangian-Constrained\nMulti-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (LC-MAPPO) algorithm to coordinate\nthree agents: Subgraph Architect, Path Navigator, and Context Curator, so that\nsubgraph construction, reasoning-path discovery, and evidence selection are\njointly optimized under per-query resource budgets on edge edits, interaction\nsteps, and selected tokens. Across HotpotQA, MetaQA, and FactKG, CLAUSE yields\nhigher EM@1 while reducing subgraph growth and end-to-end latency at equal or\nlower token budgets. On MetaQA-2-hop, relative to the strongest RAG baseline\n(GraphRAG), CLAUSE achieves +39.3 EM@1 with 18.6% lower latency and 40.9% lower\nedge growth. The resulting contexts are compact, provenance-preserving, and\ndeliver predictable performance under deployment constraints."}

Inspired by activation steering in large language models and latent\nediting in computer vision, we introduce a framework for inference-time Latent\nActivation Editing (LAE) that refines the behavior of pre-trained policies\nwithout modifying their weights or architecture. The framework operates in two\nstages: (i) an online classifier monitors intermediate activations to detect\nstates associated with undesired behaviors, and (ii) an activation editing\nmodule that selectively modifies flagged activations to shift the policy\ntowards safer regimes. In this work, we focus on improving safety in\nmulti-quadrotor navigation. We hypothesize that amplifying a policy's internal\nperception of risk can induce safer behaviors. We instantiate this idea through\na latent collision world model trained to predict future pre-collision\nactivations, thereby prompting earlier and more cautious avoidance responses.\nExtensive simulations and real-world Crazyflie experiments demonstrate that LAE\nachieves statistically significant reduction in collisions (nearly 90% fewer\ncumulative collisions compared to the unedited baseline) and substantially\nincreases the fraction of collision-free trajectories, while preserving task\ncompletion.

Going beyond an\naccuracy-based investigation of how these two components sculpt the reasoning\nprocess, this paper introduces a novel analysis framework that quantifies\nreasoning paths and captures their qualitative changes under each training\nprocess (with models of 1.5B, 7B, and 14B parameters on mathematical domains).\nSpecifically, we investigate the reasoning process at two levels of\ngranularity: the trajectory-level, which examines complete reasoning outputs,\nand the step-level, which analyzes reasoning graphs whose nodes correspond to\nindividual reasoning steps. Notably, clustering of unique reasoning\ntrajectories shows complementary effects: RL compresses incorrect trajectories,\nwhereas SFT expands correct ones. Step-level analysis reveals that RL steepens\n(about 2.5 times), while SFT flattens (reduced to about one-third), the decay\nrates of node visitation frequency, degree, and betweenness centrality\ndistributions in the reasoning graph. This indicates that RL concentrates\nreasoning functionality into a small subset of steps, while SFT homogenizes it\nacross many steps. Furthermore, by evaluating the reasoning graph topologies\nfrom multiple perspectives, we delineate the shared and distinct\ncharacteristics of RL and SFT. Our work presents a novel reasoning path\nperspective that explains why the current best practice of two-stage training,\nwith SFT followed by RL, is successful, and offers practical implications for\ndata construction and more efficient learning approaches."}

This anthropomorphic approach creates two critical barriers: 1) it\nlimits robotic capabilities to tasks humans can already perform, and 2) it\nmakes data collection for learning-based methods exceedingly difficult. Both\nchallenges are caused by traditional force-closure which requires coordinating\ncomplex, multi-point contacts based on friction, normal force, and gravity to\ngrasp an object. This makes teleoperated demonstrations unstable and amplifies\nthe sim-to-real gap for reinforcement learning. In this work, we propose a\nparadigm shift: moving away from replicating human mechanics toward the design\nof novel robotic embodiments. We introduce the \\textbf{S}uction\n\\textbf{Leap}-Hand (SLeap Hand), a multi-fingered hand featuring integrated\nfingertip suction cups that realize a new form of suction-enabled dexterity. By\nreplacing complex force-closure grasps with stable, single-point adhesion, our\ndesign fundamentally simplifies in-hand teleoperation and facilitates the\ncollection of high-quality demonstration data.

Previous research has demonstrated the performance and safety\nbenefits of shared control schemes using both subjective and objective\nevaluations.

Many models yield accurate but unclear statistical\noutputs, while others generate fluent but statistically unsupported narratives,\noften undermining both the validity of the explanation and the predictive\naccuracy itself. This shortcoming comes from a shallow interaction with the\ndata, preventing the development of a deep, detailed understanding similar to a\nhuman expert's. We argue that high accuracy and high-quality explanations are\nnot separate objectives but are mutually reinforcing outcomes of a model that\ndevelops a deep, direct understanding of the data. To achieve this, we propose\nthe Reflective Cognitive Architecture (RCA), a novel framework that coordinates\nmultiple LLMs to learn from direct experience. RCA features an iterative rule\nrefinement mechanism that improves its logic from prediction errors and a\ndistribution-aware rules check mechanism that bases its reasoning in the\ndataset's global statistics. By using predictive accuracy as a signal to drive\ndeeper comprehension, RCA builds a strong internal model of the data. We\nevaluated RCA on one private and two public datasets against 22 baselines. The\nresults demonstrate that RCA not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and\nrobustness with a relative improvement of up to 40\\% over the baseline but,\nmore importantly, leverages this deep understanding to excel in generating\nexplanations that are clear, logical, evidence-based, and balanced,\nhighlighting its potential for creating genuinely trustworthy clinical decision\nsupport systems.

We introduce the\nCrossInstruct framework, which integrates cross-modal instructions as examples\ninto the context input to a foundational vision-language model (VLM).

Submitted to npj Digital Medicine", "summary": "Purpose: To develop a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system powered by\nLLaMA-4 109B for automated, protocol-aware, and interpretable evaluation of\nradiotherapy treatment plans.\n  Methods and Materials: We curated a multi-protocol dataset of 614\nradiotherapy plans across four disease sites and constructed a knowledge base\ncontaining normalized dose metrics and protocol-defined constraints. The RAG\nsystem integrates three core modules: a retrieval engine optimized across five\nSentenceTransformer backbones, a percentile prediction component based on\ncohort similarity, and a clinical constraint checker. These tools are directed\nby a large language model (LLM) using a multi-step prompt-driven reasoning\npipeline to produce concise, grounded evaluations.\n  Results: Retrieval hyperparameters were optimized using Gaussian Process on a\nscalarized loss function combining root mean squared error (RMSE), mean\nabsolute error (MAE), and clinically motivated accuracy thresholds. The best\nconfiguration, based on all-MiniLM-L6-v2, achieved perfect nearest-neighbor\naccuracy within a 5-percentile-point margin and a sub-2pt MAE.

Parasitic\nactuation delays can have deleterious effects and impose limits on the mobility\nand safety of CAVs.

And a semantic-probabilistic\ntopological map supports coarse-to-fine planning: LLM-based global reasoning\nfor subgoal selection and vision-based local planning for obstacle avoidance.\nIntegrated with reinforcement-learning locomotion controllers, the framework is\ndeployable across diverse legged robot platforms. Experiments in simulation and\nreal-world settings demonstrate consistent improvements in semantic accuracy,\nplanning quality, and navigation success, while ablation studies further\nshowcase the necessity of both hierarchical perception and fine local planning.\nThis work introduces a new paradigm for SLAM-free, vision-language-driven\nnavigation, shifting robotic exploration from geometry-centric mapping to\nsemantics-driven decision making."}

Such an action\nrepresentation is general, as it extends the standard end-effector pose action\nrepresentation and supports a diverse set of manipulation tasks in a unified\nmanner. The oriented keypoint in our method enables natural generalization to\nobjects with different shapes and sizes, while achieving sub-centimeter\naccuracy.

It enables the\nintegration of previously distinct domains and has become a mainstream trend in\ntoday's innovation process. However, accurately measuring technological\nconvergence remains a persistent challenge due to its inherently\nmultidimensional and evolving nature. This study designs an Technological\nConvergence Index (TCI) that comprehensively measures convergence along two\nfundamental dimensions: depth and breadth. For depth calculation, we use IPC\ntextual descriptions as the analytical foundation and enhance this assessment\nby incorporating supplementary patent metadata into a heterogeneous graph\nstructure. This graph is then modeled using Heterogeneous Graph Transformers in\ncombination with Sentence-BERT, enabling a precise representation of knowledge\nintegration across technological boundaries. Complementing this, the breadth\ndimension captures the diversity of technological fields involved, quantified\nthrough the Shannon Diversity Index to measure the variety of technological\ncombinations within patents. Our final TCI is constructed using the Entropy\nWeight Method, which objectively assigns weights to both dimensions based on\ntheir information entropy. To validate our approach, we compare the proposed\nTCI against established convergence measures, demonstrating its comparative\nadvantages. We further establish empirical reliability through a novel\nrobustness test that regresses TCI against indicators of patent quality. These\nfindings are further substantiated through comprehensive robustness checks. Our\nmultidimensional approach provides valuable practical insights for innovation\npolicy and industry strategies in managing emerging cross-domain technologies."}
