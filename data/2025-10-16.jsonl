Forestalling these challenges through scenario analysis\nis confounded by the lack of realistic and coherent load data across\nrepresentative distribution feeders. Load profiling approaches often rely on\nsummarising demand through typical profiles, which oversimplifies the\ncomplexity of substation-level operations and limits their applicability in\nspecific power system studies. Sampling methods, and more recently generative\nmodels, have attempted to address this through synthesising representative\nloads from historical exemplars; however, while these approaches can\napproximate load shapes to a convincing degree of fidelity, the co-behaviour\nbetween substations, which ultimately impacts higher voltage level network\noperation, is often overlooked. This limitation will become even more\npronounced with the increasing integration of low-carbon technologies, as\nestimates of base loads fail to capture load diversity. To address this gap, a\nConditional Diffusion model for synthesising daily active and reactive power\nprofiles at the low voltage distribution substation level is proposed. The\nevaluation of fidelity is demonstrated through conventional metrics capturing\ntemporal and statistical realism, as well as power flow modelling. The results\nshow synthesised load profiles are plausible both independently and as a cohort\nin a wider power systems context.

However, in real-world\nsettings -- where policies shift, human behavior adapts, and unexpected events\nunfold -- effective analysis must go beyond surface-level trends to uncover the\nactual forces driving them. The recent rise of Large Language Models (LLMs)\npresents new opportunities for rethinking time series analysis by integrating\nmultimodal inputs. However, as the use of LLMs becomes popular, we must remain\ncautious, asking why we use LLMs and how to exploit them effectively. Most\nexisting LLM-based methods still employ their numerical regression ability and\nignore their deeper reasoning potential. This paper argues for rethinking time\nseries with LLMs as a reasoning task that prioritizes causal structure and\nexplainability. This shift brings time series analysis closer to human-aligned\nunderstanding, enabling transparent and context-aware insights in complex\nreal-world environments."}

Optimizing for a misspecified proxy reward function often\ninduces reward hacking, resulting in a policy misaligned with the human's true\nobjectives. An alternative is to perform RL from human feedback, which involves\nlearning a reward function from scratch by collecting human preferences over\npairs of trajectories. However, building such datasets is costly. To address\nthe limitations of both approaches, we propose Preference-Based Reward Repair\n(PBRR): an automated iterative framework that repairs a human-specified proxy\nreward function by learning an additive, transition-dependent correction term\nfrom preferences. A manually specified reward function can yield policies that\nare highly suboptimal under the ground-truth objective, yet corrections on only\na few transitions may suffice to recover optimal performance. To identify and\ncorrect for those transitions, PBRR uses a targeted exploration strategy and a\nnew preference-learning objective. We prove in tabular domains PBRR has a\ncumulative regret that matches, up to constants, that of prior preference-based\nRL methods. In addition, on a suite of reward-hacking benchmarks, PBRR\nconsistently outperforms baselines that learn a reward function from scratch\nfrom preferences or modify the proxy reward function using other approaches,\nrequiring substantially fewer preferences to learn high performing policies."}

However, existing bias benchmarks continue to rely on templated prompts\nor restrictive multiple-choice questions that are suggestive, simplistic, and\nfail to capture the complexity of real-world user interactions. In this work,\nwe address this gap by introducing a counterfactual bias evaluation framework\nthat automatically generates realistic, open-ended questions over sensitive\nattributes such as sex, race, or religion. By iteratively mutating and\nselecting bias-inducing questions, our approach systematically explores areas\nwhere models are most susceptible to biased behavior.

However, models trained by MADRL are vulnerable to adversarial\nperturbations on states and actions. Therefore, it is essential to investigate\nthe robustness of MADRL models from an attack perspective. Existing studies\nfocus on either state-only attacks or action-only attacks, but do not consider\nhow to effectively joint them. Simply combining state and action perturbations\nsuch as randomly perturbing states and actions does not exploit their potential\nsynergistic effects. In this paper, we propose the State-Action Joint Attack\n(SAJA) framework that has a good synergistic effects. SAJA consists of two\nimportant phases: (1) In the state attack phase, a multi-step gradient ascent\nmethod utilizes both the actor network and the critic network to compute an\nadversarial state, and (2) in the action attack phase, based on the perturbed\nstate, a second gradient ascent uses the critic network to craft the final\nadversarial action. Additionally, a heuristic regularizer measuring the\ndistance between the perturbed actions and the original clean ones is added\ninto the loss function to enhance the effectiveness of the critic's guidance.\nWe evaluate SAJA in the Multi-Agent Particle Environment (MPE), demonstrating\nthat (1) it outperforms and is more stealthy than state-only or action-only\nattacks, and (2) existing state or action defense methods cannot defend its\nattacks."}

It involves a cooperative game\nmodel where a generator generates the most human-intelligible parts of the\ninput (i.e., rationales), followed by a predictor that makes predictions based\non these generated rationales. Conventional rationalization methods typically\nimpose constraints via regularization terms to calibrate or penalize undesired\ngeneration. However, these methods are suffering from a problem called mode\ncollapse, in which the predictor produces correct predictions yet the generator\nconsistently outputs rationales with collapsed patterns. Moreover, existing\nstudies are typically designed separately for specific collapsed patterns,\nlacking a unified consideration. In this paper, we systematically revisit\ncooperative rationalization from a novel game-theoretic perspective and\nidentify the fundamental cause of this problem: the generator no longer tends\nto explore new strategies to uncover informative rationales, ultimately leading\nthe system to converge to a suboptimal game equilibrium (correct predictions\nv.s collapsed rationales). To solve this problem, we then propose a novel\napproach, Game-theoretic Policy Optimization oriented RATionalization (PORAT),\nwhich progressively introduces policy interventions to address the game\nequilibrium in the cooperative game process, thereby guiding the model toward a\nmore optimal solution state.

In this context, safety is no longer about\nblocking harmful content, but about preempting downstream hazards like\nfinancial or physical harm. Yet, most AI guardrails continue to rely on output\nclassification based on labeled datasets and human-specified criteria,making\nthem brittle to new hazardous situations. Even when unsafe conditions are\nflagged, this detection offers no path to recovery: typically, the AI system\nsimply refuses to act--which is not always a safe choice. In this work, we\nargue that agentic AI safety is fundamentally a sequential decision problem:\nharmful outcomes arise from the AI system's continually evolving interactions\nand their downstream consequences on the world. We formalize this through the\nlens of safety-critical control theory, but within the AI model's latent\nrepresentation of the world. This enables us to build predictive guardrails\nthat (i) monitor an AI system's outputs (actions) in real time and (ii)\nproactively correct risky outputs to safe ones, all in a model-agnostic manner\nso the same guardrail can be wrapped around any AI model. We also offer a\npractical training recipe for computing such guardrails at scale via\nsafety-critical reinforcement learning. Our experiments in simulated driving\nand e-commerce settings demonstrate that control-theoretic guardrails can\nreliably steer LLM agents clear of catastrophic outcomes (from collisions to\nbankruptcy) while preserving task performance, offering a principled dynamic\nalternative to today's flag-and-block guardrails."}

Forestalling these challenges through scenario analysis\nis confounded by the lack of realistic and coherent load data across\nrepresentative distribution feeders. Load profiling approaches often rely on\nsummarising demand through typical profiles, which oversimplifies the\ncomplexity of substation-level operations and limits their applicability in\nspecific power system studies. Sampling methods, and more recently generative\nmodels, have attempted to address this through synthesising representative\nloads from historical exemplars; however, while these approaches can\napproximate load shapes to a convincing degree of fidelity, the co-behaviour\nbetween substations, which ultimately impacts higher voltage level network\noperation, is often overlooked.

To address this gap, a\nConditional Diffusion model for synthesising daily active and reactive power\nprofiles at the low voltage distribution substation level is proposed. The\nevaluation of fidelity is demonstrated through conventional metrics capturing\ntemporal and statistical realism, as well as power flow modelling. The results\nshow synthesised load profiles are plausible both independently and as a cohort\nin a wider power systems context.

As they become\nintegrated into everyday tasks, growing reliance on their outputs raises\nsignificant concerns. In particular, users may unknowingly be exposed to\nmodel-inherent biases that systematically disadvantage or stereotype certain\ngroups. However, existing bias benchmarks continue to rely on templated prompts\nor restrictive multiple-choice questions that are suggestive, simplistic, and\nfail to capture the complexity of real-world user interactions. In this work,\nwe address this gap by introducing a counterfactual bias evaluation framework\nthat automatically generates realistic, open-ended questions over sensitive\nattributes such as sex, race, or religion. By iteratively mutating and\nselecting bias-inducing questions, our approach systematically explores areas\nwhere models are most susceptible to biased behavior. Beyond detecting harmful\nbiases, we also capture distinct response dimensions that are increasingly\nrelevant in user interactions, such as asymmetric refusals and explicit\nacknowledgment of bias. Leveraging our framework, we construct CAB, a\nhuman-verified benchmark spanning diverse topics, designed to enable\ncross-model comparisons. Using CAB, we analyze a range of LLMs across multiple\nbias dimensions, revealing nuanced insights into how different models manifest\nbias. For instance, while GPT-5 outperforms other models, it nonetheless\nexhibits persistent biases in specific scenarios.

Drawing on historical analogies, we emphasize that no past\ntransition constituted a strict singularity: disruptive shifts eventually\nbecame governable through new norms and institutions.\n  We examine recurring patterns across revolutions -- democratization at the\nusage layer, concentration at the production layer, falling costs, and\ndeepening personalization -- and show how these dynamics are intensifying in\nthe AI era.

Forestalling these challenges through scenario analysis\nis confounded by the lack of realistic and coherent load data across\nrepresentative distribution feeders. Load profiling approaches often rely on\nsummarising demand through typical profiles, which oversimplifies the\ncomplexity of substation-level operations and limits their applicability in\nspecific power system studies. Sampling methods, and more recently generative\nmodels, have attempted to address this through synthesising representative\nloads from historical exemplars; however, while these approaches can\napproximate load shapes to a convincing degree of fidelity, the co-behaviour\nbetween substations, which ultimately impacts higher voltage level network\noperation, is often overlooked. This limitation will become even more\npronounced with the increasing integration of low-carbon technologies, as\nestimates of base loads fail to capture load diversity. To address this gap, a\nConditional Diffusion model for synthesising daily active and reactive power\nprofiles at the low voltage distribution substation level is proposed. The\nevaluation of fidelity is demonstrated through conventional metrics capturing\ntemporal and statistical realism, as well as power flow modelling.

Drawing on historical analogies, we emphasize that no past\ntransition constituted a strict singularity: disruptive shifts eventually\nbecame governable through new norms and institutions.\n  We examine recurring patterns across revolutions -- democratization at the\nusage layer, concentration at the production layer, falling costs, and\ndeepening personalization -- and show how these dynamics are intensifying in\nthe AI era. Sectoral analysis illustrates how accounting, law, education,\ntranslation, advertising, and software engineering are being reshaped as\nroutine cognition is commoditized and human value shifts to judgment, trust,\nand ethical responsibility. At the frontier, the challenge of designing moral\nAI agents highlights the need for robust guardrails, mechanisms for moral\ngeneralization, and governance of emergent multi-agent dynamics.\n  We conclude that AI is neither a singular break nor merely incremental\nprogress.

It investigates the time-varying nature of\naggregated flexibility and highlights how it can vary seasonally. Furthermore,\nsimulations of future scenarios reveal that aggregated flexibility does not\nincrease linearly or monotonically with higher levels of flexible device\npenetration. This is primarily due to the overloading of individual feeders,\nwhich underscores the impact of grid topology and network constraints on the\naggregated flexibility potential."}

In this work, we present an\napproach for the fabrication of scalable macroscale structures using simple\nrobots and interlocking lattice building blocks. A target structure is first\nvoxelized so that it can be populated with an architected lattice. These voxels\nare then grouped into larger interconnected blocks, which are produced using\nstandard digital fabrication processes, leveraging their capability to produce\nhighly complex geometries at a small scale. These blocks, on the size scale of\ntens of centimeters, are then fed to mobile relative robots that are able to\ntraverse over the structure and place new blocks to form structures on the\nmeter scale. To facilitate the assembly of large structures, we introduce a\nlive digital twin simulation tool for controlling and coordinating assembly\nrobots that enables both global planning for a target structure and live user\ndesign, interaction, or intervention. To improve assembly throughput, we\nintroduce a new modular assembly robot, designed for hierarchical voxel\nhandling. We validate this system by demonstrating the voxelization,\nhierarchical blocking, path planning, and robotic fabrication of a set of\nmeter-scale objects."}

In this context, safety is no longer about\nblocking harmful content, but about preempting downstream hazards like\nfinancial or physical harm. Yet, most AI guardrails continue to rely on output\nclassification based on labeled datasets and human-specified criteria,making\nthem brittle to new hazardous situations. Even when unsafe conditions are\nflagged, this detection offers no path to recovery: typically, the AI system\nsimply refuses to act--which is not always a safe choice. In this work, we\nargue that agentic AI safety is fundamentally a sequential decision problem:\nharmful outcomes arise from the AI system's continually evolving interactions\nand their downstream consequences on the world. We formalize this through the\nlens of safety-critical control theory, but within the AI model's latent\nrepresentation of the world. This enables us to build predictive guardrails\nthat (i) monitor an AI system's outputs (actions) in real time and (ii)\nproactively correct risky outputs to safe ones, all in a model-agnostic manner\nso the same guardrail can be wrapped around any AI model. We also offer a\npractical training recipe for computing such guardrails at scale via\nsafety-critical reinforcement learning.

Its core idea is spatially guided\nvision-language-action training, where spatial grounding serves as the critical\nlink between instructions and robot actions. InternVLA-M1 employs a two-stage\npipeline: (i) spatial grounding pre-training on over 2.3M spatial reasoning\ndata to determine ``where to act'' by aligning instructions with visual,\nembodiment-agnostic positions, and (ii) spatially guided action post-training\nto decide ``how to act'' by generating embodiment-aware actions through\nplug-and-play spatial prompting. This spatially guided training recipe yields\nconsistent gains: InternVLA-M1 outperforms its variant without spatial guidance\nby +14.6% on SimplerEnv Google Robot, +17% on WidowX, and +4.3% on LIBERO\nFranka, while demonstrating stronger spatial reasoning capability in box,\npoint, and trace prediction. To further scale instruction following, we built a\nsimulation engine to collect 244K generalizable pick-and-place episodes,\nenabling a 6.2% average improvement across 200 tasks and 3K+ objects. In\nreal-world clustered pick-and-place, InternVLA-M1 improved by 7.3%, and with\nsynthetic co-training, achieved +20.6% on unseen objects and novel\nconfigurations. Moreover, in long-horizon reasoning-intensive scenarios, it\nsurpassed existing works by over 10%.
