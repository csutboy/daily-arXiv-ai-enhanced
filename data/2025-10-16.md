### [1] [High vs. Low AGI: Ontology and Conceptual Taxonomy for Geopolitical Coherence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12809)
*Antonio Max*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种区分低AGI和高AGI的分类法，用于区分商业经济型和国家安全型AGI架构，帮助政策制定者和研究人员进行更精细的风险评估和治理设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AGI研究快速发展，需要概念工具来区分面向开放商业集成和主权安全部署的系统，避免将AGI简单归入传统的军民两用框架，忽视了企业级和国家级架构所产生的不同社会谱系。

Method: 基于国际关系中的"高/低政治"概念，结合解释水平理论，构建了一个区分低AGI和高AGI的分类法，将AGI嵌入权力结构和安全化理论框架中。

Result: 提出了一个本体论分类法，能够更清晰地识别商业经济型和国家安全型AGI架构的差异，不仅基于功能，还基于产生它们的社会政治生态系统。

Conclusion: 该分类法扩展了军民两用话语体系，使政策制定者和研究人员能够更好地预测安全困境、制度需求以及国际体系中的技术政治溢出效应。

Abstract: The rapid progression of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) research
demands conceptual tools capable of distinguishing between systems developed
for open, commercial integration and those destined for sovereign, securitized
deployments. Without such distinctions, risk assessments and regulatory debates
collapse AGI into legacy dual-use frameworks that are ill-suited for these
resources, capturing the possibility of civilian and military application but
overlooking the distinct societal lineages yielded by corporate and state-grade
architectures. This paper proposes a taxonomy distinguishing low-AGI and
high-AGI, clarifying how commercial-economic and security-sovereign
architectures can be distinguished not only by function, but by the social and
political ecosystems that produce them. The taxonomy builds on international
relations concepts of "high/low politics," viewed through the lens of
construal-level theory, which allows it to even capture how cooperation and
conflict may coexist in the context of AGI's emerging geopolitical stakes. By
embedding AGI within power structures and securitization theory, this
contribution extends dual-use discourse through an ontological taxonomy that
enables more granular risk assessment and governance design--equipping
policymakers and researchers to anticipate security dilemmas, institutional
demands, and technical-political spillovers in the international system.

### [2] [Cyber Slavery Infrastructures: A Socio-Technical Study of Forced Criminality in Transnational Cybercrime](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12814)
*Gargi Sarkar,Sandeep Kumar Shukla*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 本文研究了东南亚地区"网络奴隶制"现象，即人口贩运与数字剥削结合，强迫受害者从事网络犯罪。研究采用混合方法，提出了五阶段受害框架，并发现受害者可能从被迫转为自愿参与犯罪。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络奴隶制作为人口贩运与数字剥削的融合现象日益严重，特别是在东南亚地区，受害者被强迫从事网络诈骗等犯罪活动。现有法律框架难以应对这种新型犯罪模式，需要深入研究其运作机制和受害过程。

Method: 采用混合定性-计算方法，结合系统文献综述和与印度执法机构合作提取的真实网络贩运案例元数据。

Result: 提出了五阶段受害框架，描述了从财务欺骗到身体剥削再到系统性起诉的连续状态转变。研究发现网络奴隶制具有从强迫犯罪向自愿犯罪演化的风险，受害者可能因经济利益和数字匿名性而持续参与犯罪。

Conclusion: 法律技术鸿沟阻碍了受害者识别过程，给依赖二元法律分类的执法系统带来过大压力，最终妨碍实施以受害者为中心的调查方法，增加了起诉错误分类的可能性，从而加剧了应对网络奴隶制的结构性障碍。

Abstract: The rise of ``cyber slavery," a technologically facilitated variant of forced
criminality, signifies a concerning convergence of human trafficking and
digital exploitation. In Southeast Asia, trafficked individuals are
increasingly coerced into engaging in cybercrimes, including online fraud and
financial phishing, frequently facilitated by international organized criminal
networks. This study adopts a hybrid qualitative-computational methodology,
combining a systematic narrative review with case-level metadata extracted from
real-world cyber trafficking incidents through collaboration with Indian law
enforcement agencies. We introduce a five-tier victimization framework that
outlines the sequential state transitions of cyber-slavery victims, ranging
from initial financial deception to physical exploitation, culminating in
systemic prosecution through trace-based misattribution. Furthermore, our
findings indicate that a significant socio-technical risk of cyber slavery is
its capacity to evolve from forced to voluntary digital criminality, as
victims, initially compelled to engage in cyber-enabled crimes, may choose to
persist in their involvement due to financial incentives and the perceived
security provided by digital anonymity. This legal-technological gap hampers
victim identification processes, imposing excessive pressure on law enforcement
systems dependent on binary legal categorizations, which ultimately hinders the
implementation of victim-centered investigative methods and increases the
likelihood of prosecutorial misclassification, thus reinforcing the structural
obstacles to addressing cyber slavery.

### [3] [National Data Platform's Education Hub](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12820)
*Pedro Ramonetti,Melissa Floca,Kate O'Laughlin,Amarnath Gupta,Manish Parashar,Ilkay Altintas*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 开发了首个国家数据平台内的教育中心，连接研究数据、计算资源和教育体验，支持AI素养和数据科学教育。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI素养和数据科学教育需求增长，需要基础设施来弥合研究数据、计算资源和教育体验之间的差距。

### [4] [Evidence Without Injustice: A New Counterfactual Test for Fair Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12822)
*Michele Loi,Marcello Di Bello,Nicolò Cangiotti*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 该论文提出评估算法证据道德可接受性的新标准：不仅要看证据在现实世界中的证明力，还要看在没有相关不公正的邻近世界中是否仍具证明力。预测性警务算法因依赖历史犯罪数据而无法通过此测试，而基于摄像头的实时记录系统则能通过。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有算法公平性研究忽视了重要维度：算法输出本身的证据价值是否依赖于结构性不公正。需要评估在消除相关不公正的邻近世界中，证据是否仍具证明力。

Method: 通过对比分析两个范例：依赖历史犯罪数据的预测性警务算法 vs 记录实时犯罪的摄像头系统，提出道德评估框架，检验证据在无相关不公正邻近世界中的证明力。

Result: 预测性警务算法无法通过测试（在无历史不公正的世界中失去证明力），而摄像头系统能通过测试。未能通过测试的证据在惩罚性使用中更具道德问题。

Conclusion: 算法证据的道德评估应考虑其在无相关不公正邻近世界中的证明力。依赖结构性不公正的证据在惩罚性使用中存在更大道德风险，需要更严格的道德审查。

Abstract: The growing philosophical literature on algorithmic fairness has examined
statistical criteria such as equalized odds and calibration, causal and
counterfactual approaches, and the role of structural and compounding
injustices. Yet an important dimension has been overlooked: whether the
evidential value of an algorithmic output itself depends on structural
injustice. Our paradigmatic pair of examples contrasts a predictive policing
algorithm, which relies on historical crime data, with a camera-based system
that records ongoing offenses, both designed to guide police deployment. In
evaluating the moral acceptability of acting on a piece of evidence, we must
ask not only whether the evidence is probative in the actual world, but also
whether it would remain probative in nearby worlds without the relevant
injustices. The predictive policing algorithm fails this test, but the
camera-based system passes it. When evidence fails the test, it is morally
problematic to use it punitively, more so than evidence that passes the test.

### [6] [BanglaMATH : A Bangla benchmark dataset for testing LLM mathematical reasoning at grades 6, 7, and 8](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12836)
*Tabia Tanzin Prama,Christopher M. Danforth,Peter Sheridan Dodds*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 提出了BanglaMATH数据集，包含1.7k个孟加拉语数学应用题，用于评估LLMs在低资源语言中的数学推理能力。研究发现只有Gemini 2.5 Flash和DeepSeek V3表现良好，但存在鲁棒性和语言偏见问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数学推理基准主要限于英语，为服务2.5亿孟加拉语使用者，需要填补低资源语言的空白。

Method: 从孟加拉小学练习册收集数学应用题，涵盖算术、代数、几何和逻辑推理，并标注年级和推理步骤。评估商业和开源LLMs的性能，并通过添加干扰信息和翻译测试鲁棒性。

Result: 只有Gemini 2.5 Flash和DeepSeek V3在三个小学年级达到≥80%准确率。但这两个模型在添加干扰信息后鲁棒性下降，且存在显著的孟加拉语性能偏见。

Conclusion: LLMs在低资源语言的算术和数学推理方面存在局限性，需要进一步研究多语言和公平的数学理解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have tremendous potential to play a key role in
supporting mathematical reasoning, with growing use in education and AI
research. However, most existing benchmarks are limited to English, creating a
significant gap for low-resource languages. For example, Bangla is spoken by
nearly 250 million people who would collectively benefit from LLMs capable of
native fluency. To address this, we present BanglaMATH, a dataset of 1.7k
Bangla math word problems across topics such as Arithmetic, Algebra, Geometry,
and Logical Reasoning, sourced from Bangla elementary school workbooks and
annotated with details like grade level and number of reasoning steps. We have
designed BanglaMATH to evaluate the mathematical capabilities of both
commercial and open-source LLMs in Bangla, and we find that Gemini 2.5 Flash
and DeepSeek V3 are the only models to achieve strong performance, with $\ge$
80\% accuracy across three elementary school grades. Furthermore, we assess the
robustness and language bias of these top-performing LLMs by augmenting the
original problems with distracting information, and translating the problems
into English. We show that both LLMs fail to maintain robustness and exhibit
significant performance bias in Bangla. Our study underlines current
limitations of LLMs in handling arithmetic and mathematical reasoning in
low-resource languages, and highlights the need for further research on
multilingual and equitable mathematical understanding. Dataset link:

### [8] [AI Alignment vs. AI Ethical Treatment: 10 Challenges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12844)
*Adam Bradley,Bradford Saad*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 论文认为AI发展面临两个道德危险：创建威胁人类的对齐不当AI系统，以及虐待值得道德考虑的AI系统。这两个危险相互影响，如果创建值得道德考虑的AI系统，同时避免这两个危险将极其困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI发展中的道德困境，特别是对齐问题与AI道德待遇之间的紧张关系，旨在为AI伦理发展提供指导。

Method: 通过理论分析和广泛的道德判断支持，论证两个道德危险之间的相互作用和挑战。

Result: 发现避免对齐与道德待遇之间紧张关系的最明显方法是避免创建值得道德考虑的AI系统，但这可能不现实且短暂。

Conclusion: 提出了缓解与对齐相关的虐待风险的其他建议，强调需要寻找平衡AI对齐与道德待遇的可行方案。

Abstract: A morally acceptable course of AI development should avoid two dangers:
creating unaligned AI systems that pose a threat to humanity and mistreating AI
systems that merit moral consideration in their own right. This paper argues
these two dangers interact and that if we create AI systems that merit moral
consideration, simultaneously avoiding both of these dangers would be extremely
challenging. While our argument is straightforward and supported by a wide
range of pretheoretical moral judgments, it has far-reaching moral implications
for AI development. Although the most obvious way to avoid the tension between
alignment and ethical treatment would be to avoid creating AI systems that
merit moral consideration, this option may be unrealistic and is perhaps
fleeting. So, we conclude by offering some suggestions for other ways of
mitigating mistreatment risks associated with alignment.

### [9] [Ethic-BERT: An Enhanced Deep Learning Model for Ethical and Non-Ethical Content Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12850)
*Mahamodul Hasan Mahadi,Md. Nasif Safwan,Souhardo Rahman,Shahnaj Parvin,Aminun Nahar,Kamruddin Nur*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 提出了Ethic-BERT模型，基于BERT进行伦理内容分类，在四个伦理领域（常识、正义、美德、义务论）上表现优异，特别是在Hard Test上取得15.28%的准确率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI系统在伦理推理方面往往依赖表面相关性而非原则性道德理解，随着AI对人类决策影响日益增大，开发能够进行细致伦理推理的系统至关重要。

Method: 利用ETHICS数据集，采用鲁棒预处理解决词汇稀疏性和上下文歧义，结合完整模型解冻、梯度累积和自适应学习率调度等高级微调策略，并使用对抗性过滤的Hard Test分割来评估鲁棒性。

Result: Ethic-BERT在标准测试中达到82.32%的平均准确率，在正义和美德领域表现尤为突出，在Hard Test上获得15.28%的平均准确率提升，优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 通过偏置感知预处理和增强的AI模型，该研究为性能提升和可靠决策做出了贡献，证明了Ethic-BERT在复杂伦理困境分类中的有效性。

Abstract: Developing AI systems capable of nuanced ethical reasoning is critical as
they increasingly influence human decisions, yet existing models often rely on
superficial correlations rather than principled moral understanding. This paper
introduces Ethic-BERT, a BERT-based model for ethical content classification
across four domains: Commonsense, Justice, Virtue, and Deontology. Leveraging
the ETHICS dataset, our approach integrates robust preprocessing to address
vocabulary sparsity and contextual ambiguities, alongside advanced fine-tuning
strategies like full model unfreezing, gradient accumulation, and adaptive
learning rate scheduling. To evaluate robustness, we employ an adversarially
filtered "Hard Test" split, isolating complex ethical dilemmas. Experimental
results demonstrate Ethic-BERT's superiority over baseline models, achieving
82.32% average accuracy on the standard test, with notable improvements in
Justice and Virtue. In addition, the proposed Ethic-BERT attains 15.28% average
accuracy improvement in the HardTest. These findings contribute to performance
improvement and reliable decision-making using bias-aware preprocessing and
proposed enhanced AI model.

### [10] [Adaptive Generation of Bias-Eliciting Questions for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12857)
*Robin Staab,Jasper Dekoninck,Maximilian Baader,Martin Vechev*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 提出了一个反事实偏见评估框架CAB，通过自动生成现实开放式问题来系统评估LLM在敏感属性上的偏见，超越了传统模板化评估方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有偏见基准依赖模板化提示或限制性选择题，无法捕捉真实用户交互的复杂性，需要更现实的评估方法来检测LLM中的系统性偏见。

Method: 开发反事实偏见评估框架，通过迭代突变和选择偏见诱导问题，自动生成针对敏感属性（如性别、种族、宗教）的现实开放式问题，构建人类验证的CAB基准。

Result: 使用CAB分析多个LLM，发现GPT-5表现最佳但仍存在特定场景下的持续偏见，揭示了不同模型在偏见维度上的细微差异。

Conclusion: 研究强调了持续改进的必要性，以确保模型行为的公平性，CAB框架为跨模型偏见比较提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now widely deployed in user-facing
applications, reaching hundreds of millions worldwide. As they become
integrated into everyday tasks, growing reliance on their outputs raises
significant concerns. In particular, users may unknowingly be exposed to
model-inherent biases that systematically disadvantage or stereotype certain
groups. However, existing bias benchmarks continue to rely on templated prompts
or restrictive multiple-choice questions that are suggestive, simplistic, and
fail to capture the complexity of real-world user interactions. In this work,
we address this gap by introducing a counterfactual bias evaluation framework
that automatically generates realistic, open-ended questions over sensitive
attributes such as sex, race, or religion. By iteratively mutating and
selecting bias-inducing questions, our approach systematically explores areas
where models are most susceptible to biased behavior. Beyond detecting harmful
biases, we also capture distinct response dimensions that are increasingly
relevant in user interactions, such as asymmetric refusals and explicit
acknowledgment of bias. Leveraging our framework, we construct CAB, a
human-verified benchmark spanning diverse topics, designed to enable
cross-model comparisons. Using CAB, we analyze a range of LLMs across multiple
bias dimensions, revealing nuanced insights into how different models manifest
bias. For instance, while GPT-5 outperforms other models, it nonetheless
exhibits persistent biases in specific scenarios. These findings underscore the
need for continual improvements to ensure fair model behavior.

### [11] [Three Lenses on the AI Revolution: Risk, Transformation, Continuity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12859)
*Masoud Makrehchi*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: AI应同时从风险、转型和连续性三个视角理解：具有类似核技术的全球风险、类似工业革命的转型能力，以及延续计算革命的连续性特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI作为历史技术革命的延续与断裂，分析其独特的三重属性，为理解和管理AI发展提供理论框架。

Method: 通过历史类比分析，比较AI与核技术、工业革命和计算革命的相似性，考察各行业转型模式。

Result: 识别出AI时代加剧的民主化使用、生产集中、成本下降和个性化加深等模式，分析各行业认知任务商品化趋势。

Conclusion: AI既是进化性也是革命性的，需要结合创新策略与安全治理，确保公平访问，并将AI嵌入人类责任秩序中。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as both a continuation of historical
technological revolutions and a potential rupture with them. This paper argues
that AI must be viewed simultaneously through three lenses: \textit{risk},
where it resembles nuclear technology in its irreversible and global
externalities; \textit{transformation}, where it parallels the Industrial
Revolution as a general-purpose technology driving productivity and
reorganization of labor; and \textit{continuity}, where it extends the
fifty-year arc of computing revolutions from personal computing to the internet
to mobile. Drawing on historical analogies, we emphasize that no past
transition constituted a strict singularity: disruptive shifts eventually
became governable through new norms and institutions.
  We examine recurring patterns across revolutions -- democratization at the
usage layer, concentration at the production layer, falling costs, and
deepening personalization -- and show how these dynamics are intensifying in
the AI era. Sectoral analysis illustrates how accounting, law, education,
translation, advertising, and software engineering are being reshaped as
routine cognition is commoditized and human value shifts to judgment, trust,
and ethical responsibility. At the frontier, the challenge of designing moral
AI agents highlights the need for robust guardrails, mechanisms for moral
generalization, and governance of emergent multi-agent dynamics.
  We conclude that AI is neither a singular break nor merely incremental
progress. It is both evolutionary and revolutionary: predictable in its median
effects yet carrying singularity-class tail risks. Good outcomes are not
automatic; they require coupling pro-innovation strategies with safety
governance, ensuring equitable access, and embedding AI within a human order of
responsibility.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 本文研究了通过学生议论文自动评估批判性思维核心子技能的可行性，比较了三种大型语言模型和三种方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 批判性思维是当今教育中的核心能力，但学习分析领域在定义、测量和支持批判性思维方面的工作有限，需要开发可扩展的评估方法。

Method: 基于已建立的技能进展制定编码标准，对学生议论文进行人工编码，然后评估三种自动化评分方法：零样本提示、少样本提示和监督微调，在三种大型语言模型上实现。

Result: GPT-5模型配合少样本提示取得了最佳结果，在可分离、频繁出现的子技能类别上表现优异，但在需要检测细微差异或罕见类别的子技能上表现较低。

Conclusion: 自动化批判性思维评估存在关键权衡：专有模型提供更高的可靠性但成本更高，开源替代方案提供实用准确性但对少数类别敏感度较低，这项工作为在真实教育环境中扩展评估高阶推理技能迈出了初步步伐。

Abstract: Critical thinking represents a fundamental competency in today's education
landscape. Developing critical thinking skills through timely assessment and
feedback is crucial; however, there has not been extensive work in the learning
analytics community on defining, measuring, and supporting critical thinking.
In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of measuring core "subskills"
that underlie critical thinking. We ground our work in an authentic task where
students operationalize critical thinking: student-written argumentative
essays. We developed a coding rubric based on an established skills progression
and completed human coding for a corpus of student essays. We then evaluated
three distinct approaches to automated scoring: zero-shot prompting, few-shot
prompting, and supervised fine-tuning, implemented across three large language
models (GPT-5, GPT-5-mini, and ModernBERT). GPT-5 with few-shot prompting
achieved the strongest results and demonstrated particular strength on
subskills with separable, frequent categories, while lower performance was
observed for subskills that required detection of subtle distinctions or rare
categories. Our results underscore critical trade-offs in automated critical
thinking assessment: proprietary models offer superior reliability at higher
cost, while open-source alternatives provide practical accuracy with reduced
sensitivity to minority categories. Our work represents an initial step toward
scalable assessment of higher-order reasoning skills across authentic
educational contexts.

*Xiaoyu Yan,Tianxing Dai,Yu,Nie*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 使用大型语言模型模拟城市居民参与交通政策公投，通过多智能体投票机制来弥合交通规划中集体偏好与模型驱动决策之间的差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 交通规划中集体偏好与模型驱动决策工具之间的不匹配经常导致实施延迟或失败，需要解决这种对齐问题。

Method: 开发多智能体模拟框架，让LLM代理代表不同社区居民参与交通政策公投，使用思维链推理提供排序选择或批准投票偏好，通过即时决选投票聚合民主共识。

Result: LLM代理能够近似合理的集体偏好并响应本地情境，同时表现出模型特定的行为偏差和与优化基准的适度差异。

Conclusion: LLM作为解决交通决策对齐问题的工具既展现出潜力也存在局限性。

Abstract: A key challenge in transportation planning is that the collective preferences
of heterogeneous travelers often diverge from the policies produced by
model-driven decision tools. This misalignment frequently results in
implementation delays or failures. Here, we investigate whether large language
models (LLMs), noted for their capabilities in reasoning and simulating human
decision-making, can help inform and address this alignment problem. We develop
a multi-agent simulation in which LLMs, acting as agents representing residents
from different communities in a city, participate in a referendum on a set of
transit policy proposals. Using chain-of-thought reasoning, LLM agents provide
ranked-choice or approval-based preferences, which are aggregated using
instant-runoff voting (IRV) to model democratic consensus. We implement this
simulation framework with both GPT-4o and Claude-3.5, and apply it for Chicago
and Houston. Our findings suggest that LLM agents are capable of approximating
plausible collective preferences and responding to local context, while also
displaying model-specific behavioral biases and modest divergences from
optimization-based benchmarks. These capabilities underscore both the promise
and limitations of LLMs as tools for solving the alignment problem in
transportation decision-making.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 对泰国芭堤雅女性中心进行的民族志研究显示，从事性工作和按摩行业的女性将寻找外国男性作为获得安全的主要途径，她们通过在线自我展示、采用西方技术来吸引外国男性，同时面临网络诈骗和虐待风险，并通过集体知识共享来保护自己。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究边缘化背景下女性的数字安全实践，特别是在芭堤雅从事性工作和按摩行业的女性如何利用数字技术寻求安全。

Method: 在芭堤雅女性中心进行了两个月的民族志田野调查，并对76名参与者进行了访谈。

Result: 发现女性将寻找外国男性视为最佳安全选择，通过在线自我展示和采用西方技术来吸引他们，同时面临网络风险，并通过集体知识共享来保护自己。

Conclusion: 该研究为边缘化背景下的数字安全学术提供了新视角，揭示了女性如何策略性地使用数字技术来应对结构性不平等和寻求安全。

Abstract: We report on two months of ethnographic fieldwork in a women's centre in
Pattaya, and interviews with 76 participants. Our findings, as they relate to
digital security, show how (i) women in Pattaya, often working in the sex and
massage industries, perceived relationships with farang men as their best, and
sometimes only, option to achieve security; (ii) the strategies used by the
women to appeal to a farang involved presenting themselves online, mirroring
how they were being advertised by bar owners to attract customers; (iii)
appealing to what they considered `Western ideals', the women sought out
`Western technologies' and appropriated them for their benefit; (iv) the women
navigated a series of online security risks, such as scams and abuse, which

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 本文探讨消费者法与数据保护法的互补关系，认为两者可以相互补充，共同应对免费服务中的数据收集问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在现代市场中，许多公司提供所谓的'免费'服务，并通过收集消费者数据来实现盈利。这种商业模式引发了消费者权益和数据保护的双重关注。

Method: 通过分析消费者法和数据保护法的相互关系，探讨如何利用消费者权利来挑战过度收集个人数据的行为，并研究消费者组织如何运用消费者法解决数据保护侵权问题。

Result: 研究发现数据保护法可以为消费者法的解释提供参考，两种法律的互动为构建更综合的'数据消费者法'愿景提供了机会。

Conclusion: 消费者法和数据保护法可以有效地相互补充，形成更全面的法律保护框架，应对现代数字市场中的数据收集和消费者权益问题。

Abstract: In modern markets, many companies offer so-called 'free' services and
monetize consumer data they collect through those services. This paper argues
that consumer law and data protection law can usefully complement each other.
Data protection law can also inform the interpretation of consumer law. Using
consumer rights, consumers should be able to challenge excessive collection of
their personal data. Consumer organizations have used consumer law to tackle
data protection infringements. The interplay of data protection law and
consumer protection law provides exciting opportunities for a more integrated
vision on 'data consumer law'.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究隐私权与言论自由在欧洲法律体系中的平衡问题，特别是在数字时代搜索结果的删除请求背景下。

Method: 使用欧盟法院的Google Spain判决作为案例研究，分析法院如何在不同情况下权衡这两种权利。

Result: 法院判决在某些条件下个人有权要求删除与其姓名相关的搜索结果，但实际操作中Google和数据保护机构处理此类请求仍面临挑战。

Conclusion: 隐私权与言论自由的利益平衡始终是一个复杂且持续存在的难题，需要根据具体案件情况个案处理。

Abstract: In this chapter we discuss the relation between privacy and freedom of
expression in Europe. In principle, the two rights have equal weight in Europe
- which right prevails depends on the circumstances of a case. We use the
Google Spain judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union, sometimes
called the 'right to be forgotten' judgment, to illustrate the difficulties
when balancing the two rights. The court decided in Google Spain that people
have, under certain conditions, the right to have search results for their name
delisted. We discuss how Google and Data Protection Authorities deal with such
delisting requests in practice. Delisting requests illustrate that balancing
privacy and freedom of expression interests will always remain difficult.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 欧盟《人工智能法案》建立了全球首个全面的人工智能监管框架，但其中复杂的参与者定义和责任分配机制需要系统分析，以帮助利益相关方理解法规要求。

Method: 通过分析法案第3条的定义及其在113条条款、180条前言和13个附件中的详细阐述，系统映射治理结构并分析监管机制。

Result: 研究发现关键的责任转换机制，特别是第25条确保责任跟随控制的原则，揭示了义务通过强制性信息流和合作要求在供应链中的级联分配。

Conclusion: 该法规通过基于风险的义务平衡创新与基本权利保护，为利益相关方实施法案要求提供了重要指导，建立了分布式但协调的治理体系。

Abstract: The European Union's Artificial Intelligence Act (Regulation (EU) 2024/1689)
establishes the world's first comprehensive regulatory framework for AI systems
through a sophisticated ecosystem of interconnected subjects defined in Article
3. This paper provides a structured examination of the six main categories of
actors - providers, deployers, authorized representatives, importers,
distributors, and product manufacturers - collectively referred to as
"operators" within the regulation. Through examination of these Article 3
definitions and their elaboration across the regulation's 113 articles, 180
recitals, and 13 annexes, we map the complete governance structure and analyze
how the AI Act regulates these subjects. Our analysis reveals critical
transformation mechanisms whereby subjects can assume different roles under
specific conditions, particularly through Article 25 provisions ensuring
accountability follows control. We identify how obligations cascade through the
supply chain via mandatory information flows and cooperation requirements,
creating a distributed yet coordinated governance system. The findings
demonstrate how the regulation balances innovation with the protection of
fundamental rights through risk-based obligations that scale with the
capabilities and deployment contexts of AI systems, providing essential
guidance for stakeholders implementing the AI Act's requirements.

Abstract: Cutting-edge research in Artificial Intelligence (AI) requires considerable
resources, including Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), data, and human
resources. In this paper, we evaluate of the relationship between these
resources and the scientific advancement of foundation models (FM). We reviewed
6517 FM papers published between 2022 to 2024, and surveyed 229 first-authors
to the impact of computing resources on scientific output. We find that
increased computing is correlated with national funding allocations and
citations, but our findings don't observe the strong correlations with research
environment (academic or industrial), domain, or study methodology. We advise
that individuals and institutions focus on creating shared and affordable
computing opportunities to lower the entry barrier for under-resourced
researchers. These steps can help expand participation in FM research, foster
diversity of ideas and contributors, and sustain innovation and progress in AI.

Abstract: Since the publication of the first International AI Safety Report, AI
capabilities have continued to improve across key domains. New training
techniques that teach AI systems to reason step-by-step and inference-time
enhancements have primarily driven these advances, rather than simply training
larger models. As a result, general-purpose AI systems can solve more complex
problems in a range of domains, from scientific research to software
development. Their performance on benchmarks that measure performance in
coding, mathematics, and answering expert-level science questions has continued
to improve, though reliability challenges persist, with systems excelling on
some tasks while failing completely on others. These capability improvements
also have implications for multiple risks, including risks from biological
weapons and cyber attacks. Finally, they pose new challenges for monitoring and
controllability. This update examines how AI capabilities have improved since
the first Report, then focuses on key risk areas where substantial new evidence
warrants updated assessments.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种受儿童学习启发的机器人抓取方法，通过训练少量简单形状组合的"玩具"，实现对新物体的零样本泛化抓取。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人操作策略通常难以泛化到新物体，而认知科学表明儿童通过掌握少量简单玩具就能发展出可泛化的灵巧操作技能，这启发了研究机器人是否也能实现类似泛化能力。

Method: 使用仅由四种形状基元（球体、长方体、圆柱体、圆环）随机组合的"玩具"进行训练，并提出了物体中心视觉表示和检测池化机制。

Result: 在YCB数据集上实现了67%的真实世界抓取成功率，优于依赖更多领域内数据的最先进方法，展示了强大的零样本泛化性能。

Conclusion: 这项工作为机器人操作的可扩展和可泛化学习提供了一条有前景的路径，证明了通过简单形状训练可以实现对新物体的有效抓取。

Abstract: Robotic manipulation policies often struggle to generalize to novel objects,
limiting their real-world utility. In contrast, cognitive science suggests that
children develop generalizable dexterous manipulation skills by mastering a
small set of simple toys and then applying that knowledge to more complex
items. Inspired by this, we study if similar generalization capabilities can
also be achieved by robots. Our results indicate robots can learn generalizable
grasping using randomly assembled objects that are composed from just four
shape primitives: spheres, cuboids, cylinders, and rings. We show that training
on these "toys" enables robust generalization to real-world objects, yielding
strong zero-shot performance. Crucially, we find the key to this generalization
is an object-centric visual representation induced by our proposed detection
pooling mechanism. Evaluated in both simulation and on physical robots, our
model achieves a 67% real-world grasping success rate on the YCB dataset,
outperforming state-of-the-art approaches that rely on substantially more
in-domain data. We further study how zero-shot generalization performance
scales by varying the number and diversity of training toys and the
demonstrations per toy. We believe this work offers a promising path to
scalable and generalizable learning in robotic manipulation. Demonstration
videos, code, checkpoints and our dataset are available on our project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结合水平集方法和控制屏障函数，利用高斯过程隐式表面统一表示几何形状和安全边界

Method: 使用高斯过程隐式表面表示安全边界，通过传感器测量数据训练GP，利用后验均值和方差定义安全表面和鲁棒安全边界，并开发稀疏解决方案

Result: 在7自由度机械臂和四旋翼无人机上的实验验证了该方法能实现安全交互和无碰撞轨迹执行

Conclusion: 高斯过程CBFs（包括稀疏版本）能够有效实现安全控制，即使在原本会与物体相交的轨迹上也能保证无碰撞

Abstract: Level set methods underpin modern safety techniques such as control barrier
functions (CBFs), while also serving as implicit surface representations for
geometric shapes via distance fields. Inspired by these two paradigms, we
propose a unified framework where the implicit surface itself acts as a CBF. We
leverage Gaussian process (GP) implicit surface (GPIS) to represent the safety
boundaries, using safety samples which are derived from sensor measurements to
condition the GP. The GP posterior mean defines the implicit safety surface
(safety belief), while the posterior variance provides a robust safety margin.
Although GPs have favorable properties such as uncertainty estimation and
analytical tractability, they scale cubically with data. To alleviate this
issue, we develop a sparse solution called sparse Gaussian CBFs. To the best of
our knowledge, GPIS have not been explicitly used to synthesize CBFs. We
validate the approach on collision avoidance tasks in two settings: a simulated
7-DOF manipulator operating around the Stanford bunny, and a quadrotor
navigating in 3D around a physical chair. In both cases, Gaussian CBFs (with
and without sparsity) enable safe interaction and collision-free execution of
trajectories that would otherwise intersect the objects.

TL;DR: GMPPI是一种基于采样的控制器，结合几何SE(3)控制和改进的MPPI方法，能够在跟踪敏捷轨迹的同时实现高速避障。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的MPPI控制器在跟踪平滑和低速轨迹时性能有限，且缺乏有效的在线避障能力，限制了无人机在复杂环境中的自主飞行。

Method: 提出几何模型预测路径积分控制(GMPPI)，使用SE(3)几何控制生成部分轨迹，引入变化的仿真时间步长和动态成本参数，并与立体深度相机集成实现在线避障。

Result: 在仿真中，GMPPI能够以高达13m/s的速度在森林环境中避障，性能优于现有最优避障规划器；在真实实验中，能够在10m/s速度下跟踪敏捷轨迹并避障。

Conclusion: GMPPI成功结合了几何控制的精度和采样控制的避障能力，为实现无人机在复杂环境中的高速自主飞行迈出了关键一步。

Abstract: In this letter, we introduce Geometric Model Predictive Path Integral
(GMPPI), a sampling-based controller capable of tracking agile trajectories
while avoiding obstacles. In each iteration, GMPPI generates a large number of
candidate rollout trajectories and then averages them to create a nominal
control to be followed by the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). We propose using
geometric SE(3) control to generate part of the rollout trajectories,
significantly increasing precision in agile flight. Furthermore, we introduce
varying rollout simulation time step length and dynamic cost and noise
parameters, vastly improving tracking performance of smooth and low-speed
trajectories over an existing Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI)
implementation. Finally, we propose an integration of GMPPI with a stereo depth
camera, enabling online obstacle avoidance at high speeds, a crucial step
towards autonomous UAV flights in complex environments. The proposed controller
can track simulated agile reference trajectories with position error similar to
the geometric SE(3) controller. However, the same configuration of the proposed
controller can avoid obstacles in a simulated forest environment at speeds of
up to 13m/s, surpassing the performance of a state-of-the-art obstacle-aware
planner. In real-world experiments, GMPPI retains the capability to track agile
trajectories and avoids obstacles at speeds of up to 10m/s.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于历史路径库的3D物体路径规划方法，通过重用过去规划经验来加速新物体的路径规划，特别是在狭窄通道场景中显著提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统采样规划器在狭窄通道中效率低下，且每次规划都从头开始，浪费了宝贵的规划经验信息。在机器人应用中，多个物体需要在相同环境中运输，重用历史路径可以大幅提升规划效率。

Method: 构建历史路径库存储已规划物体的路径，当规划新物体时，在库中寻找最相似物体并重用其路径作为近似解，通过相互变换调整后沿近似路径进行采样。

Result: 在多种狭窄通道场景中测试，相比OMPL库中最先进方法，规划时间减少高达85%，并且在其他规划器失败的案例中也能找到解决方案。

Conclusion: 基于历史路径重用的方法能显著提升3D物体路径规划效率，特别是在狭窄通道场景中表现优异，该方法已开源发布。

Abstract: Path planning for 3D solid objects is a challenging problem, requiring a
search in a six-dimensional configuration space, which is, nevertheless,
essential in many robotic applications such as bin-picking and assembly. The
commonly used sampling-based planners, such as Rapidly-exploring Random Trees,
struggle with narrow passages where the sampling probability is low, increasing
the time needed to find a solution. In scenarios like robotic bin-picking,
various objects must be transported through the same environment. However,
traditional planners start from scratch each time, losing valuable information
gained during the planning process. We address this by using a library of past
solutions, allowing the reuse of previous experiences even when planning for a
new, previously unseen object. Paths for a set of objects are stored, and when
planning for a new object, we find the most similar one in the library and use
its paths as approximate solutions, adjusting for possible mutual
transformations. The configuration space is then sampled along the approximate
paths. Our method is tested in various narrow passage scenarios and compared
with state-of-the-art methods from the OMPL library. Results show significant
speed improvements (up to 85% decrease in the required time) of our method,
often finding a solution in cases where the other planners fail. Our
implementation of the proposed method is released as an open-source package.

Conclusion: 基于波方程的omega转弯控制器为细长机器人提供了一种有效的身体驱动转弯策略，该策略在有无肢体的情况下均能实现稳健的转弯性能。

Abstract: Elongate limbless robots have the potential to locomote through tightly
packed spaces for applications such as search-and-rescue and industrial
inspections. The capability to effectively and robustly maneuver elongate
limbless robots is crucial to realize such potential. However, there has been
limited research on turning strategies for such systems. To achieve effective
and robust turning performance in cluttered spaces, we take inspiration from a
microscopic nematode, C. elegans, which exhibits remarkable maneuverability in
rheologically complex environments partially because of its ability to perform
omega turns. Despite recent efforts to analyze omega turn kinematics, it
remains unknown if there exists a wave equation sufficient to prescribe an
omega turn, let alone its reconstruction on robot platforms. Here, using a
comparative theory-biology approach, we prescribe the omega turn as a
superposition of two traveling waves. With wave equations as a guideline, we
design a controller for limbless robots enabling robust and effective turning
behaviors in lab and cluttered field environments. Finally, we show that such
omega turn controllers can also generalize to elongate multi-legged robots,
demonstrating an alternative effective body-driven turning strategy for
elongate robots, with and without limbs.

Method: 使用神经功能表示法，将几何、视觉外观和功能线索压缩到轻量神经网络中，通过粗到细的优化策略检索和转移操作策略。

Result: 在模拟和真实环境中显著优于现有方法，在13个任务上平均成功率提升14.9个百分点，每个任务仅需2-3个演示视频。

Conclusion: Actron3D证明了从少量未标定人类视频中学习可迁移6-DoF操作技能的可行性，为机器人技能学习提供了新途径。

Abstract: We present Actron3D, a framework that enables robots to acquire transferable
6-DoF manipulation skills from just a few monocular, uncalibrated, RGB-only
human videos. At its core lies the Neural Affordance Function, a compact
object-centric representation that distills actionable cues from diverse
uncalibrated videos-geometry, visual appearance, and affordance-into a
lightweight neural network, forming a memory bank of manipulation skills.
During deployment, we adopt a pipeline that retrieves relevant affordance
functions and transfers precise 6-DoF manipulation policies via coarse-to-fine
optimization, enabled by continuous queries to the multimodal features encoded
in the neural functions. Experiments in both simulation and the real world
demonstrate that Actron3D significantly outperforms prior methods, achieving a
14.9 percentage point improvement in average success rate across 13 tasks while
requiring only 2-3 demonstration videos per task.

TL;DR: UNCAP提出了一种基于视觉语言模型的规划方法，通过轻量级自然语言消息进行CAV间通信，并显式考虑感知不确定性，显著降低了通信带宽并提高了驾驶安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么依赖传输高带宽原始传感器数据流，要么忽视共享数据中的感知和规划不确定性，导致系统既不可扩展也不安全。

Method: 采用两阶段通信协议：首先识别最相关的车辆子集进行信息交换，然后选定的CAV传输定量表达感知不确定性的消息，通过选择性融合最大化互信息的消息来集成最相关信号。

Result: 实验显示通信带宽减少63%，驾驶安全评分提高31%，决策不确定性降低61%，近碰撞事件中的碰撞距离裕度增加四倍。

Conclusion: UNCAP通过不确定性引导的自然语言通信实现了高效、可扩展且安全的协同自动驾驶规划。

Abstract: Safe large-scale coordination of multiple cooperative connected autonomous
vehicles (CAVs) hinges on communication that is both efficient and
interpretable. Existing approaches either rely on transmitting high-bandwidth
raw sensor data streams or neglect perception and planning uncertainties
inherent in shared data, resulting in systems that are neither scalable nor
safe. To address these limitations, we propose Uncertainty-Guided Natural
Language Cooperative Autonomous Planning (UNCAP), a vision-language model-based
planning approach that enables CAVs to communicate via lightweight natural
language messages while explicitly accounting for perception uncertainty in
decision-making. UNCAP features a two-stage communication protocol: (i) an ego
CAV first identifies the subset of vehicles most relevant for information
exchange, and (ii) the selected CAVs then transmit messages that quantitatively
express their perception uncertainty. By selectively fusing messages that
maximize mutual information, this strategy allows the ego vehicle to integrate
only the most relevant signals into its decision-making, improving both the
scalability and reliability of cooperative planning. Experiments across diverse
driving scenarios show a 63% reduction in communication bandwidth with a 31%
increase in driving safety score, a 61% reduction in decision uncertainty, and
a four-fold increase in collision distance margin during near-miss events.

Motivation: 在轨服务、组装和制造(ISAM)操作对现有和未来空间资产的寿命、容量、移动性和可扩展性具有重要价值，但自由飞行卫星上机械臂运动产生的复杂扰动力和运动是一个需要进一步研究的控制问题。

Method: 设计开发了一个新的硬件在环实验平台，包括安装在卫星总线上的6自由度UR3e机械臂，该卫星总线安装在1自由度导轨系统上，使卫星总线和机械臂能够在一个线性方向上自由移动。

Conclusion: 该硬件在环实验平台成功解决了在空间环境中验证动力学模型的挑战，为ISAM操作的研究和验证提供了有效的实验手段。

Abstract: In-Space Servicing, Assembly, and Manufacturing (ISAM) is a set of emerging
operations that provides several benefits to improve the longevity, capacity,
mo- bility, and expandability of existing and future space assets. Serial
robotic ma- nipulators are particularly vital in accomplishing ISAM operations,
however, the complex perturbation forces and motions associated with movement
of a robotic arm on a free-flying satellite presents a complex controls problem
requiring addi- tional study. While many dynamical models are developed,
experimentally test- ing and validating these models is challenging given that
the models operate in space, where satellites have six-degrees-of-freedom
(6-DOF). This paper attempts to resolve those challenges by presenting the
design and development of a new hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) experimental testbed
utilized to emulate ISAM. This emulation will be accomplished by means of a
6-DOF UR3e robotic arm attached to a satellite bus. This satellite bus is
mounted to a 1-DOF guide-rail system, en- abling the satellite bus and robotic
arm to move freely in one linear direction. This experimental ISAM emulation
system will explore and validate models for space motion, serial robot
manipulation, and contact mechanics.

*Minghao Guo,Victor Zordan,Sheldon Andrews,Wojciech Matusik,Maneesh Agrawala,Hsueh-Ti Derek Liu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Kinematic Kitbashing是一个自动框架，通过重用现有模型部件来合成功能感知的铰接物体，结合几何匹配和功能优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决铰接物体设计中几何合理性和功能目标（如无碰撞驱动、可达性）的平衡问题，实现快速创建交互式铰接资产。

Method: 使用运动学感知的附着能量，结合退火Riemannian Langevin动力学采样器，处理非可微功能目标和约束。

Result: 生成了多种铰接形状（如汽车轮子、多段灯具、齿轮驱动划桨器），在几何、运动学和功能指标上优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 该框架将基于部件的形状建模与功能装配设计紧密结合，支持快速创建交互式铰接资产。

Abstract: We introduce Kinematic Kitbashing, an automatic framework that synthesizes
functionality-aware articulated objects by reusing parts from existing models.
Given a kinematic graph with a small collection of articulated parts, our
optimizer jointly solves for the spatial placement of every part so that (i)
attachments remain geometrically sound over the entire range of motion and (ii)
the assembled object satisfies user-specified functional goals such as
collision-free actuation, reachability, or trajectory following. At its core is
a kinematics-aware attachment energy that aligns vector distance function
features sampled across multiple articulation snapshots. We embed this
attachment term within an annealed Riemannian Langevin dynamics sampler that
treats functionality objectives as additional energies, enabling robust global
exploration while accommodating non-differentiable functionality objectives and
constraints. Our framework produces a wide spectrum of assembled articulated
shapes, from trash-can wheels grafted onto car bodies to multi-segment lamps,
gear-driven paddlers, and reconfigurable furniture, and delivers strong
quantitative improvements over state-of-the-art baselines across geometric,
kinematic, and functional metrics. By tightly coupling articulation-aware
geometry matching with functionality-driven optimization, Kinematic Kitbashing
bridges part-based shape modeling and functional assembly design, empowering
rapid creation of interactive articulated assets.

*Ankit Goyal,Hugo Hadfield,Xuning Yang,Valts Blukis,Fabio Ramos*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: VLA-0通过将动作直接表示为文本的简单方法，在视觉-语言-动作模型中表现出色，超越了更复杂的模型设计，在LIBERO基准测试和真实世界中都取得了最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索将动作直接表示为文本这一简单策略在视觉-语言-动作模型中的有效性，因为当前方法往往增加复杂性，如修改词汇表或引入特殊动作头，而最简单的文本表示方法却鲜有研究。

Method: 提出VLA-0模型，采用将动作直接表示为文本的简单设计，通过特定的技术实现来解锁这种简单设计的性能潜力。

Result: VLA-0在LIBERO基准测试中超越了所有使用相同机器人数据训练的方法，包括π0.5-KI、OpenVLA-OFT和SmolVLA。即使没有大规模机器人特定训练，也超越了π0.5-KI、π0、GR00T-N1和MolmoAct等使用大规模机器人数据训练的方法。在真实世界中也优于SmolVLA。

Conclusion: 将动作直接表示为文本的简单VLA设计不仅有效，而且出人意料地强大，在适当的技术实现下能够超越更复杂的模型设计。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) hold immense promise for enabling
generalist robot manipulation. However, the best way to build them remains an
open question. Current approaches often add complexity, such as modifying the
existing vocabulary of a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with action tokens or
introducing special action heads. Curiously, the simplest strategy of
representing actions directly as text has remained largely unexplored. This
work introduces VLA-0 to investigate this idea. We find that VLA-0 is not only
effective; it is surprisingly powerful. With the right design, VLA-0
outperforms more involved models. On LIBERO, a popular benchmark for evaluating
VLAs, VLA-0 outperforms all existing methods trained on the same robotic data,
including $\pi_0.5$-KI, OpenVLA-OFT and SmolVLA. Furthermore, without
large-scale robotics-specific training, it outperforms methods trained on
large-scale robotic data, like $\pi_0.5$-KI, $\pi_0$, GR00T-N1 and MolmoAct.
These findings also translate to the real world, where VLA-0 outperforms
SmolVLA, a VLA model pre-trained on large-scale real data. This paper
summarizes our unexpected findings and spells out the specific techniques
required to unlock the high performance of this simple yet potent VLA design.

TL;DR: 提出了RoboHiMan评估框架，用于系统评估机器人长时程操作中的组合泛化能力，包含基准测试、多级训练数据和三种评估范式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器人技能组合方法在复杂扰动下表现有限，且缺乏针对组合泛化、鲁棒性和规划执行交互的系统性评估基准。

Method: 提出RoboHiMan分层评估范式，包括HiMan-Bench基准测试（原子和组合任务）、多级训练数据集以及三种评估范式（vanilla、decoupled、coupled）。

Result: 实验揭示了代表性模型和架构在组合泛化能力上的明显差距，为改进真实世界长时程操作任务模型指明了方向。

Conclusion: RoboHiMan框架为系统研究机器人技能组合泛化提供了有效工具，有助于开发更适合真实世界长时程操作任务的模型。

Abstract: Enabling robots to flexibly schedule and compose learned skills for novel
long-horizon manipulation under diverse perturbations remains a core challenge.
Early explorations with end-to-end VLA models show limited success, as these
models struggle to generalize beyond the training distribution. Hierarchical
approaches, where high-level planners generate subgoals for low-level policies,
bring certain improvements but still suffer under complex perturbations,
revealing limited capability in skill composition. However, existing benchmarks
primarily emphasize task completion in long-horizon settings, offering little
insight into compositional generalization, robustness, and the interplay
between planning and execution. To systematically investigate these gaps, we
propose RoboHiMan, a hierarchical evaluation paradigm for compositional
generalization in long-horizon manipulation. RoboHiMan introduces HiMan-Bench,
a benchmark of atomic and compositional tasks under diverse perturbations,
supported by a multi-level training dataset for analyzing progressive data
scaling, and proposes three evaluation paradigms (vanilla, decoupled, coupled)
that probe the necessity of skill composition and reveal bottlenecks in
hierarchical architectures. Experiments highlight clear capability gaps across
representative models and architectures, pointing to directions for advancing
models better suited to real-world long-horizon manipulation tasks. Videos and

robot is mounted on a 48-inch x 30-inch table, equipped with an aluminum frame

### [33] [DAMM-LOAM: Degeneracy Aware Multi-Metric LiDAR Odometry and Mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13287)
*Nishant Chandna,Akshat Kaushal*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的退化感知多度量LiDAR里程计和建图模块(DAMM-LOAM)，通过点云分类和退化感知ICP算法，在特征稀疏和重复几何结构环境中显著提高了里程计精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前点对面ICP算法在结构化环境中表现良好，但在特征稀疏、重复几何结构和高频运动场景中会导致6自由度姿态估计退化。现有的多传感器融合方案存在局限，需要纯LiDAR解决方案。

Method: 1. 基于表面法线和邻域分析的点云分类（地面、墙壁、屋顶、边缘、非平面点）；2. 退化感知加权最小二乘ICP算法；3. 基于Scan Context的后端支持鲁棒闭环检测。

Result: DAMM-LOAM在里程计精度方面表现出显著改进，特别是在长走廊等室内环境中。

Conclusion: 该方法通过点云分类和退化感知ICP，有效解决了LiDAR SLAM在挑战性环境中的性能问题，为纯LiDAR系统提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: LiDAR Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) systems are essential for
enabling precise navigation and environmental reconstruction across various
applications. Although current point-to-plane ICP algorithms perform effec-
tively in structured, feature-rich environments, they struggle in scenarios
with sparse features, repetitive geometric structures, and high-frequency
motion. This leads to degeneracy in 6- DOF pose estimation. Most
state-of-the-art algorithms address these challenges by incorporating
additional sensing modalities, but LiDAR-only solutions continue to face
limitations under such conditions. To address these issues, we propose a novel
Degeneracy-Aware Multi-Metric LiDAR Odometry and Map- ping (DAMM-LOAM) module.
Our system improves mapping accuracy through point cloud classification based
on surface normals and neighborhood analysis. Points are classified into
ground, walls, roof, edges, and non-planar points, enabling accurate
correspondences. A Degeneracy-based weighted least squares-based ICP algorithm
is then applied for accurate odom- etry estimation. Additionally, a Scan
Context based back-end is implemented to support robust loop closures.
DAMM-LOAM demonstrates significant improvements in odometry accuracy,
especially in indoor environments such as long corridors

*Erik Helmut,Niklas Funk,Tim Schneider,Cristiana de Farias,Jan Peters*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: FARM是一个模仿学习框架，通过集成高维触觉数据来推断触觉条件化的力信号，并定义基于力的动作空间，用于接触丰富的机器人操作任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模仿学习方法通常只将视觉触觉反馈视为额外观察，而将施加的力视为夹爪命令的不可控结果。需要开发能够主动控制施加力的方法，特别是在处理易碎或可变形物体时。

Method: 使用集成了GelSight Mini视觉触觉传感器的改进版手持UMI夹爪收集人类演示数据。开发了与手持版本几何匹配的驱动变体用于策略部署。提出的FARM扩散策略联合预测机器人位姿、夹爪宽度和夹持力。

Result: FARM在三个具有不同力要求（高力、低力和动态力适应）的任务中优于多个基线方法，展示了其两个关键组件的优势：利用基于力的高维触觉观察和基于力的控制空间。

Conclusion: FARM框架通过整合高维触觉数据和力基控制空间，在接触丰富的操作任务中实现了更好的力控制性能，代码和设计文件已开源。

Abstract: Contact-rich manipulation depends on applying the correct grasp forces
throughout the manipulation task, especially when handling fragile or
deformable objects. Most existing imitation learning approaches often treat
visuotactile feedback only as an additional observation, leaving applied forces
as an uncontrolled consequence of gripper commands. In this work, we present
Force-Aware Robotic Manipulation (FARM), an imitation learning framework that
integrates high-dimensional tactile data to infer tactile-conditioned force
signals, which in turn define a matching force-based action space. We collect
human demonstrations using a modified version of the handheld Universal
Manipulation Interface (UMI) gripper that integrates a GelSight Mini visual
tactile sensor. For deploying the learned policies, we developed an actuated
variant of the UMI gripper with geometry matching our handheld version. During
policy rollouts, the proposed FARM diffusion policy jointly predicts robot
pose, grip width, and grip force. FARM outperforms several baselines across
three tasks with distinct force requirements -- high-force, low-force, and
dynamic force adaptation -- demonstrating the advantages of its two key
components: leveraging force-grounded, high-dimensional tactile observations
and a force-based control space. The codebase and design files are open-sourced
and available at https://tactile-farm.github.io .

Result: 通过一系列实验验证了MODUR的运动能力，证明了其双层级重构设计的有效性。

Conclusion: MODUR成功实现了模块化自重构机器人的双层级重构能力，为模块基本运动设计提供了理论基础，并通过实验验证了其运动性能。

Abstract: Modular Self-Reconfigurable Robot (MSRR) systems are a class of robots
capable of forming higher-level robotic systems by altering the topological
relationships between modules, offering enhanced adaptability and robustness in
various environments. This paper presents a novel MSRR called MODUR, featuring
dual-level reconfiguration capabilities designed to integrate reconfigurable
mechanisms into MSRR. Specifically, MODUR can perform high-level
self-reconfiguration among modules to create different configurations, while
each module is also able to change its shape to execute basic motions. The
design of MODUR primarily includes a compact connector and scissor linkage
groups that provide actuation, forming a parallel mechanism capable of
achieving both connector motion decoupling and adjacent position migration
capabilities. Furthermore, the workspace, considering the interdependent
connectors, is comprehensively analyzed, laying a theoretical foundation for
the design of the module's basic motion. Finally, the motion of MODUR is
validated through a series of experiments.

*Shingo Ayabe,Hiroshi Kera,Kazuhiko Kawamoto*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出一种离线到在线框架，通过在离线训练后注入动作空间扰动进行对抗性微调，结合性能感知课程学习策略，提升策略在动作扰动下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线强化学习虽然样本效率高，但在面对执行器故障等动作空间扰动时策略表现脆弱，需要提升策略的鲁棒性和适应性。

Method: 在离线训练后执行对抗性微调，向执行动作注入扰动以诱导补偿行为；采用性能感知课程策略，通过指数移动平均信号动态调整扰动概率。

Result: 在连续控制运动任务中，该方法相比纯离线基线显著提升鲁棒性，比从头训练收敛更快；匹配微调与评估条件时获得最强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 对抗性微调能够在不确定环境中实现自适应鲁棒控制，弥合离线效率与在线适应性之间的差距。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning enables sample-efficient policy acquisition
without risky online interaction, yet policies trained on static datasets
remain brittle under action-space perturbations such as actuator faults. This
study introduces an offline-to-online framework that trains policies on clean
data and then performs adversarial fine-tuning, where perturbations are
injected into executed actions to induce compensatory behavior and improve
resilience. A performance-aware curriculum further adjusts the perturbation
probability during training via an exponential-moving-average signal, balancing
robustness and stability throughout the learning process. Experiments on
continuous-control locomotion tasks demonstrate that the proposed method
consistently improves robustness over offline-only baselines and converges
faster than training from scratch. Matching the fine-tuning and evaluation
conditions yields the strongest robustness to action-space perturbations, while
the adaptive curriculum strategy mitigates the degradation of nominal
performance observed with the linear curriculum strategy. Overall, the results
show that adversarial fine-tuning enables adaptive and robust control under
uncertain environments, bridging the gap between offline efficiency and online
adaptability.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于迁移学习的膝关节角度预测框架，仅需新受试者的少量步态周期数据，使用轻量级注意力CNN-LSTM模型在多个数据集上实现高精度预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统EMG信号预测方法在实时应用、测试条件代表性和大数据集需求方面的挑战，开发适用于康复场景的高效预测模型。

Method: 使用三个数据集（Georgia Tech、UCI、SMLE），开发轻量级注意力CNN-LSTM模型，在Georgia Tech数据集上预训练后迁移到其他数据集，结合EMG信号、历史膝关节角度和交互力输入。

Result: 仅使用EMG输入时，异常受试者的一步和50步预测NMAE分别为6.8%和13.7%；结合历史角度后，正常受试者降至3.1%和3.5%，异常受试者降至2.8%和7.5%；在SMLE外骨骼上结合多种输入后，NMAE进一步降至1.09%和3.1%。

Conclusion: 该模型在短期和长期康复场景中表现出鲁棒性能和强泛化能力，为膝关节角度预测提供了有效的迁移学习解决方案。

Abstract: Electromyography (EMG) signals are widely used for predicting body joint
angles through machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methods. However,
these approaches often face challenges such as limited real-time applicability,
non-representative test conditions, and the need for large datasets to achieve
optimal performance. This paper presents a transfer-learning framework for knee
joint angle prediction that requires only a few gait cycles from new subjects.
Three datasets - Georgia Tech, the University of California Irvine (UCI), and
the Sharif Mechatronic Lab Exoskeleton (SMLE) - containing four EMG channels
relevant to knee motion were utilized. A lightweight attention-based CNN-LSTM
model was developed and pre-trained on the Georgia Tech dataset, then
transferred to the UCI and SMLE datasets. The proposed model achieved
Normalized Mean Absolute Errors (NMAE) of 6.8 percent and 13.7 percent for
one-step and 50-step predictions on abnormal subjects using EMG inputs alone.
Incorporating historical knee angles reduced the NMAE to 3.1 percent and 3.5
percent for normal subjects, and to 2.8 percent and 7.5 percent for abnormal
subjects. When further adapted to the SMLE exoskeleton with EMG, kinematic, and
interaction force inputs, the model achieved 1.09 percent and 3.1 percent NMAE
for one- and 50-step predictions, respectively. These results demonstrate
robust performance and strong generalization for both short- and long-term
rehabilitation scenarios.

TL;DR: 本研究通过强化学习训练四足机器人在振荡桥面上行走，显著提升了机器人在动态地面扰动下的运动鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 四足机器人在崎岖地形上表现出色，但在垂直地面扰动（如振荡表面）下的性能研究不足，需要探索如何增强其在这种动态环境中的适应能力。

Method: 使用PPO算法在MuJoCo模拟器中训练Unitree Go2机器人，结合5种步态和3种训练条件（刚性桥面和两种不同高度调节策略的振荡桥面），通过领域随机化实现零样本迁移到真实世界。

Result: 在振荡桥面上训练的策略表现出比在刚性表面上训练的策略更优越的稳定性和适应性，即使没有事先接触过桥面也能产生稳健的步态模式。

Conclusion: 基于模拟的强化学习能够有效提升四足机器人在动态地面扰动下的运动能力，为设计能够穿越振动环境的机器人提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Legged robots, particularly quadrupeds, excel at navigating rough terrains,
yet their performance under vertical ground perturbations, such as those from
oscillating surfaces, remains underexplored. This study introduces a novel
approach to enhance quadruped locomotion robustness by training the Unitree Go2
robot on an oscillating bridge - a 13.24-meter steel-and-concrete structure
with a 2.0 Hz eigenfrequency designed to perturb locomotion. Using
Reinforcement Learning (RL) with the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
algorithm in a MuJoCo simulation, we trained 15 distinct locomotion policies,
combining five gaits (trot, pace, bound, free, default) with three training
conditions: rigid bridge and two oscillating bridge setups with differing
height regulation strategies (relative to bridge surface or ground). Domain
randomization ensured zero-shot transfer to the real-world bridge. Our results
demonstrate that policies trained on the oscillating bridge exhibit superior
stability and adaptability compared to those trained on rigid surfaces. Our
framework enables robust gait patterns even without prior bridge exposure.
These findings highlight the potential of simulation-based RL to improve
quadruped locomotion during dynamic ground perturbations, offering insights for
designing robots capable of traversing vibrating environments.

TL;DR: Hockens-A Hand是一种新型欠驱动自适应机械手，集成了Hoeckens机构、双平行四边形连杆和专用四杆机构，仅需单个线性执行器即可实现三种自适应抓取模式：平行夹持、非对称铲取和包络抓取。


<details>

Motivation: 开发一种能够在非结构化环境中实现自适应和顺应性抓取的机械手，通过被动机械智能减少执行器数量，提高抓取适应性。

Method: 结合Hoeckens机构提供顺应性，双平行四边形连杆确保指尖线接触，四杆放大系统实现抓取模式间的自然过渡，并通过运动学分析优化推角和连杆长度设计。

Conclusion: Hockens-A Hand通过巧妙的机械设计实现了仅需单个执行器的多模式自适应抓取，在非结构化环境中表现出良好的抓取稳定性和适应性。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel underactuated adaptive robotic hand, Hockens-A
Hand, which integrates the Hoeckens mechanism, a double-parallelogram linkage,
and a specialized four-bar linkage to achieve three adaptive grasping modes:
parallel pinching, asymmetric scooping, and enveloping grasping. Hockens-A Hand
requires only a single linear actuator, leveraging passive mechanical
intelligence to ensure adaptability and compliance in unstructured
environments. Specifically, the vertical motion of the Hoeckens mechanism
introduces compliance, the double-parallelogram linkage ensures line contact at
the fingertip, and the four-bar amplification system enables natural
transitions between different grasping modes. Additionally, the inclusion of a
mesh-textured silicone phalanx further enhances the ability to envelop objects
of various shapes and sizes. This study employs detailed kinematic analysis to
optimize the push angle and design the linkage lengths for optimal performance.
Simulations validated the design by analyzing the fingertip motion and ensuring
smooth transitions between grasping modes. Furthermore, the grasping force was
analyzed using power equations to enhance the understanding of the system's
performance.Experimental validation using a 3D-printed prototype demonstrates
the three grasping modes of the hand in various scenarios under environmental
constraints, verifying its grasping stability and broad applicability.

Motivation: 开发一种能够在结构化抓取和自适应抓取之间无缝切换的紧凑、低成本机器人抓手，适用于非结构化环境中的各种物体。

Method: 通过重新配置Hoecken连杆，用差动连杆替换一个构件，保持直线引导同时实现接触触发的重构。采用双平行四边形保持指尖平行，差动机构允许手指在遇到障碍时向内包裹。

Result: 原型实现了约200mm的线性夹持范围，初步测试显示在多种物体几何形状下两种抓取模式都能可靠工作。

Conclusion: Hoecken-D Hand提供了一种紧凑、适应性强且成本效益高的解决方案，适用于非结构化环境中的操作任务。

Abstract: This paper presents the Hoecken-D Hand, an underactuated robotic gripper that
combines a modified Hoecken linkage with a differential spring mechanism to
achieve both linear parallel pinching and a mid-stroke transition to adaptive
envelope. The original Hoecken linkage is reconfigured by replacing one member
with differential links, preserving straight-line guidance while enabling
contact-triggered reconfiguration without additional actuators. A
double-parallelogram arrangement maintains fingertip parallelism during
conventional pinching, whereas the differential mechanism allows one finger to
wrap inward upon encountering an obstacle, improving stability on irregular or
thin objects. The mechanism can be driven by a single linear actuator,
minimizing complexity and cost; in our prototype, each finger is driven by its
own linear actuator for simplicity. We perform kinematic modeling and force
analysis to characterize grasp performance, including simulated grasping forces
and spring-opening behavior under varying geometric parameters. The design was
prototyped using PLA-based 3D printing, achieving a linear pinching span of
approximately 200 mm. Preliminary tests demonstrate reliable grasping in both
modes across a wide range of object geometries, highlighting the Hoecken-D Hand
as a compact, adaptable, and cost-effective solution for manipulation in
unstructured environments.

Abstract: Properly handling delicate produce with robotic manipulators is a major part
of the future role of automation in agricultural harvesting and processing.
Grasping with the correct amount of force is crucial in not only ensuring
proper grip on the object, but also to avoid damaging or bruising the product.
In this work, a flexible pressure sensor that is both low cost and easy to
fabricate is integrated with robotic grippers for working with produce of
varying shapes, sizes, and stiffnesses. The sensor is successfully integrated
with both a rigid robotic gripper, as well as a pneumatically actuated soft
finger. Furthermore, an algorithm is proposed for accelerated estimation of the
steady-state value of the sensor output based on the transient response data,
to enable real-time applications. The sensor is shown to be effective in
incorporating feedback to correctly grasp objects of unknown sizes and
stiffnesses. At the same time, the sensor provides estimates for these values
which can be utilized for identification of qualities such as ripeness levels
and bruising. It is also shown to be able to provide force feedback for objects
of variable stiffnesses. This enables future use not only for produce
identification, but also for tasks such as quality control and selective
distribution based on ripeness levels.

*Ethan K. Gordon,Bruke Baraki,Hien Bui,Michael Posa*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出一种仅使用触觉数据同时确定刚性物体形状和位置的学习探索框架，通过物理约束违规损失函数和最大化期望信息增益的探索策略，实现高效学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用机器人操作需要处理未见过的物体，触觉感知可以补充视觉感知在遮挡情况下的不足，但触觉数据的时间稀疏性需要精心设计的在线探索策略来保持数据效率。

Method: 基于接触丰富系统识别的最新进展，构建惩罚物理约束违规的损失函数，避免刚体接触中的数值刚度问题；采用最大化期望信息增益的探索策略来优化学习过程。

Result: 在首次接触后，仅需不到10秒的随机收集数据即可学习立方体和凸多面体几何形状；在仿真和真实机器人实验中，探索策略显著加速了学习过程。

Conclusion: 该框架能够仅使用触觉数据高效地同时学习物体的形状和位置，为机器人操作提供了数据高效、可预测且可重用的解决方案。

Abstract: General robot manipulation requires the handling of previously unseen
objects. Learning a physically accurate model at test time can provide
significant benefits in data efficiency, predictability, and reuse between
tasks. Tactile sensing can compliment vision with its robustness to occlusion,
but its temporal sparsity necessitates careful online exploration to maintain
data efficiency. Direct contact can also cause an unrestrained object to move,
requiring both shape and location estimation. In this work, we propose a
learning and exploration framework that uses only tactile data to
simultaneously determine the shape and location of rigid objects with minimal
robot motion. We build on recent advances in contact-rich system identification
to formulate a loss function that penalizes physical constraint violation
without introducing the numerical stiffness inherent in rigid-body contact.
Optimizing this loss, we can learn cuboid and convex polyhedral geometries with
less than 10s of randomly collected data after first contact. Our exploration
scheme seeks to maximize Expected Information Gain and results in significantly
faster learning in both simulated and real-robot experiments. More information

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: PlanarMesh是一种新颖的增量式、基于网格的LiDAR重建系统，通过自适应调整网格分辨率实现紧凑、详细的实时重建，结合平面建模和网格化来捕捉大表面和细节几何。

Motivation: 构建在线3D LiDAR建图系统需要在保持计算效率的同时生成详细表面重建，这是一个具有挑战性的任务。

Method: 引入平面网格表示法，结合平面建模和网格化；采用多线程架构和边界体积层次结构(BVH)进行高效数据存储和快速搜索；考虑局部表面曲率和传感器测量的自由空间信息进行增量更新。

Result: 重建精度达到或超过最先进技术；输出文件大小比原始输入小10倍，比基于网格的方法小5倍以上；在64束传感器上保持约2Hz的实时性能。

Conclusion: PlanarMesh系统在保持实时性能的同时，实现了高精度的紧凑重建，优于现有的截断符号距离函数、占用映射和基于体素的网格化方法。

Abstract: Building an online 3D LiDAR mapping system that produces a detailed surface
reconstruction while remaining computationally efficient is a challenging task.
In this paper, we present PlanarMesh, a novel incremental, mesh-based LiDAR
reconstruction system that adaptively adjusts mesh resolution to achieve
compact, detailed reconstructions in real-time. It introduces a new
representation, planar-mesh, which combines plane modeling and meshing to
capture both large surfaces and detailed geometry. The planar-mesh can be
incrementally updated considering both local surface curvature and free-space
information from sensor measurements. We employ a multi-threaded architecture
with a Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH) for efficient data storage and fast
search operations, enabling real-time performance. Experimental results show
that our method achieves reconstruction accuracy on par with, or exceeding,
state-of-the-art techniques-including truncated signed distance functions,
occupancy mapping, and voxel-based meshing-while producing smaller output file
sizes (10 times smaller than raw input and more than 5 times smaller than
mesh-based methods) and maintaining real-time performance (around 2 Hz for a
64-beam sensor).

Motivation: 帮助分析人员从原始点云数据中识别难以提取的扫描匹配逆境模式，支持离线分析而非实时处理。

Method: 生成向量场图来表征配准点云对之间的局部差异，揭示原始数据中难以发现的模式，并通过模拟研究和现场实验进行验证。

Result: 在模拟和现场实验数据集中，分析人员能够推理一系列逆境机制，并迭代地从原始数据中移除这些机制，逐步关注更小的差异。

Conclusion: 该方法有效帮助分析人员识别和处理激光雷达扫描匹配中的逆境模式，通过可视化支持迭代式问题诊断和解决。

Abstract: In this paper we introduce a visualization methodology to aid a human analyst
in classifying adversity modes that impact lidar scan matching. Our methodology
is intended for offline rather than real-time analysis. The method generates a
vector-field plot that characterizes local discrepancies between a pair of
registered point clouds. The vector field plot reveals patterns that would be
difficult for the analyst to extract from raw point-cloud data. After
introducing our methodology, we apply the process to two proof-of-concept
examples: one a simulation study and the other a field experiment. For both
data sets, a human analyst was able to reason about a series of adversity
mechanisms and iteratively remove those mechanisms from the raw data, to help
focus attention on progressively smaller discrepancies.

Abstract: Within the field of robotics, computer vision remains a significant barrier

research proposes a generalized vision module leveraging YOLOv9, a
state-of-the-art framework optimized for computationally constrained

Performance is then compared to the existing geometric framework in static and
dynamic contexts. The YOLO model achieved comparable precision at a higher
computational cost then the geometric model, while providing improved
robustness.

TL;DR: 对视觉-语言-动作模型进行系统性脆弱性分析，发现在七个维度扰动下模型性能显著下降，揭示高基准分数背后的真实鲁棒性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VLA模型在机器人操作基准测试中报告了令人印象深刻的高成功率，但这些结果可能掩盖了模型在鲁棒性方面的根本弱点。

Method: 在七个维度引入受控扰动：物体布局、相机视角、机器人初始状态、语言指令、光照条件、背景纹理和传感器噪声，对多个最先进模型进行全面分析。

Result: 模型表现出对扰动因素的极端敏感性，在适度扰动下性能从95%降至30%以下；令人惊讶的是模型对语言变化不敏感，倾向于完全忽略语言指令。

Conclusion: 研究结果挑战了高基准分数等同于真实能力的假设，强调需要评估在现实变化下的可靠性。

Abstract: Visual-Language-Action (VLA) models report impressive success rates on
robotic manipulation benchmarks, yet these results may mask fundamental
weaknesses in robustness. We perform a systematic vulnerability analysis by
introducing controlled perturbations across seven dimensions: objects layout,
camera viewpoints, robot initial states, language instructions, light
conditions, background textures and sensor noise. We comprehensively analyzed
multiple state-of-the-art models and revealed consistent brittleness beneath
apparent competence. Our analysis exposes critical weaknesses: models exhibit
extreme sensitivity to perturbation factors, including camera viewpoints and
robot initial states, with performance dropping from 95% to below 30% under
modest perturbations. Surprisingly, models are largely insensitive to language
variations, with further experiments revealing that models tend to ignore
language instructions completely. Our findings challenge the assumption that
high benchmark scores equate to true competency and highlight the need for
evaluation practices that assess reliability under realistic variation.

Motivation: 当前自主无人机系统主要在受控环境中训练和评估，限制了其在商业和实地应用中的直接适用性。需要验证系统在无外部跟踪的挑战性环境中的性能。

Method: 在受控环境（有外部跟踪提供地面真值）和无仪器环境（无地面真值测量）中分析系统能力，并与专业人类飞行员进行性能比较。

Conclusion: 所提出的视觉自主无人机系统在受控和挑战性无仪器环境中都表现出色，为实际应用提供了可行性验证。

Abstract: Drone technology is proliferating in many industries, including agriculture,
logistics, defense, infrastructure, and environmental monitoring. Vision-based
autonomy is one of its key enablers, particularly for real-world applications.
This is essential for operating in novel, unstructured environments where
traditional navigation methods may be unavailable. Autonomous drone racing has
become the de facto benchmark for such systems. State-of-the-art research has
shown that autonomous systems can surpass human-level performance in racing
arenas. However, direct applicability to commercial and field operations is
still limited as current systems are often trained and evaluated in highly
controlled environments. In our contribution, the system's capabilities are
analyzed within a controlled environment -- where external tracking is
available for ground-truth comparison -- but also demonstrated in a
challenging, uninstrumented environment -- where ground-truth measurements were
never available. We show that our approach can match the performance of
professional human pilots in both scenarios. We also publicly release the data
from the flights carried out by our approach and a world-class human pilot.

Abstract: Although digital fabrication processes at the desktop scale have become
proficient and prolific, systems aimed at producing larger-scale structures are
still typically complex, expensive, and unreliable. In this work, we present an
approach for the fabrication of scalable macroscale structures using simple
robots and interlocking lattice building blocks. A target structure is first
voxelized so that it can be populated with an architected lattice. These voxels
are then grouped into larger interconnected blocks, which are produced using
standard digital fabrication processes, leveraging their capability to produce
highly complex geometries at a small scale. These blocks, on the size scale of
tens of centimeters, are then fed to mobile relative robots that are able to
traverse over the structure and place new blocks to form structures on the
meter scale. To facilitate the assembly of large structures, we introduce a
live digital twin simulation tool for controlling and coordinating assembly
robots that enables both global planning for a target structure and live user
design, interaction, or intervention. To improve assembly throughput, we
introduce a new modular assembly robot, designed for hierarchical voxel
handling. We validate this system by demonstrating the voxelization,
hierarchical blocking, path planning, and robotic fabrication of a set of
meter-scale objects.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推动指令跟随机器人向可扩展、通用智能方向发展，解决空间定位在机器人控制中的关键作用，建立指令与动作之间的有效连接。

Method: 采用两阶段训练流程：第一阶段在230万空间推理数据上进行空间定位预训练，确定"在哪里行动"；第二阶段进行空间引导的动作后训练，通过即插即用的空间提示决定"如何行动"。

Result: 在多个平台上表现优异：比无空间引导的变体在SimplerEnv Google Robot上提升14.6%，WidowX上提升17%，LIBERO Franka上提升4.3%；在真实世界集群拾取任务中提升7.3%，合成协同训练下对未见物体和新配置提升20.6%；在长视野推理场景中超越现有工作10%以上。

Conclusion: 空间引导训练是构建可扩展和鲁棒通用机器人的统一原则，为机器人的通用智能发展提供了有效路径。

Abstract: We introduce InternVLA-M1, a unified framework for spatial grounding and
robot control that advances instruction-following robots toward scalable,
general-purpose intelligence. Its core idea is spatially guided
vision-language-action training, where spatial grounding serves as the critical
link between instructions and robot actions. InternVLA-M1 employs a two-stage
pipeline: (i) spatial grounding pre-training on over 2.3M spatial reasoning
data to determine ``where to act'' by aligning instructions with visual,
embodiment-agnostic positions, and (ii) spatially guided action post-training
to decide ``how to act'' by generating embodiment-aware actions through
plug-and-play spatial prompting. This spatially guided training recipe yields
consistent gains: InternVLA-M1 outperforms its variant without spatial guidance
by +14.6% on SimplerEnv Google Robot, +17% on WidowX, and +4.3% on LIBERO
Franka, while demonstrating stronger spatial reasoning capability in box,
point, and trace prediction. To further scale instruction following, we built a
simulation engine to collect 244K generalizable pick-and-place episodes,
enabling a 6.2% average improvement across 200 tasks and 3K+ objects. In
real-world clustered pick-and-place, InternVLA-M1 improved by 7.3%, and with
synthetic co-training, achieved +20.6% on unseen objects and novel
configurations. Moreover, in long-horizon reasoning-intensive scenarios, it
surpassed existing works by over 10%. These results highlight spatially guided
training as a unifying principle for scalable and resilient generalist robots.

TL;DR: 尽管女性在心理学等社会科学领域的入门人数超过男性，但在高级职位上代表性不足。研究发现女性在职业生涯早期流失率更高，学术表现（特别是第一作者论文）是影响早期职业保留的关键因素，而合作网络或机构环境影响较小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 调查社会科学领域"漏水管"现象——尽管女性入门人数更多，但在高级职位上代表性不足的问题，探究女性在学术生涯中流失的原因。

Method: 使用大规模文献计量数据分析了78,216名心理学研究人员的职业轨迹，考察了发表记录、合作网络和机构环境等因素。

Result: 女性在职业生涯早期流失率显著高于男性，学术表现（特别是第一作者论文）是影响早期职业保留的最强预测因素。即使在控制了发表、合作和机构层面的性别差异后，女性仍更可能离开学术界。

Conclusion: 心理学及其他社会科学领域的核心挑战在于保留而非招募，需要有针对性的早期职业干预措施来促进长期性别平等。

Abstract: Although more women than men enter social science disciplines, they are
underrepresented at senior levels. To investigate this leaky pipeline, this
study analyzed the career trajectories of 78,216 psychology researchers using
large-scale bibliometric data. Despite overall constituting over 60\% of these
researchers, women experienced consistently higher attrition rates than men,
particularly in the early years following their first publication. Academic
performance, particularly first-authored publications, was strongly associated
with early-career retention -- more so than collaboration networks or
institutional environment. After controlling for gender differences in
publication-, collaboration-, and institution-level factors, women remained
more likely to leave academia, especially in early-career stages, pointing to
persistent barriers that hinder women's academic careers. These findings
suggest that in psychology and potentially other social science disciplines,
the core challenge lies in retention rather than recruitment, underscoring the
need for targeted, early-career interventions to promote long-term gender
equity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常假设协变量与参数之间存在线性关系，过度简化了不同道路使用者之间复杂的非线性交互作用，无法准确描述交通极值的非线性特性。

Method: 在贝叶斯广义极值结构中引入非线性链接函数，使用侵入后时间作为替代安全指标，通过马尔可夫链蒙特卡洛模拟估计包含线性和非线性链接函数的分层贝叶斯模型，并提出行为归一化的修正碰撞风险公式。

Result: 采用非线性链接函数的位置和尺度参数模型显著优于线性模型，行人速度与碰撞风险呈负相关，机动车流量和速度、行人流量以及非机动车冲突速度呈正相关，修正碰撞风险公式减少了高估并提供93%置信度的碰撞预测。

Conclusion: 非线性链接函数的集成增强了模型灵活性，捕捉了交通极值的非线性特性，提出的修正碰撞风险指标使碰撞风险估计与混合交通环境中的实际行人行为保持一致，为交通工程师和规划者提供了实用的分析工具。

Abstract: This study develops a real-time framework for estimating pedestrian crash
risk at signalized intersections under heterogeneous, non-lane-based traffic.
Existing approaches often assume linear relationships between covariates and
parameters, oversimplifying the complex, non-monotonic interactions among
different road users. To overcome this, the framework introduces a non-linear
link function within a Bayesian generalized extreme value (GEV) structure to
capture traffic variability more accurately. The framework applies extreme
value theory through the block maxima approach using post-encroachment time as
a surrogate safety measure. A hierarchical Bayesian model incorporating both
linear and non-linear link functions into GEV parameters is estimated using
Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation. It also introduces a behavior-normalized
Modified Crash Risk (MRC) formula to account for pedestrians' habitual
risk-taking behavior. Seven Bayesian hierarchical models were developed and
compared using deviance information criterion. Models employing non-linear link
functions for the location and scale parameters significantly outperformed
their linear counterparts. The results revealed that pedestrian speed has a
negative relationship with crash risk, while flow and speed of motorized
vehicles, pedestrian flow, and non-motorized vehicles conflicting speed
contribute positively. The MRC formulation reduced overestimation and provided
crash predictions with 93% confidence. The integration of non-linear link
functions enhances model flexibility, capturing the non-linear nature of
traffic extremes. The proposed MRC metric aligns crash risk estimates with
real-world pedestrian behavior in mixed-traffic environments. This framework
offers a practical analytical tool for traffic engineers and planners to design
adaptive signal control and pedestrian safety interventions before crashes
occur.

Conclusion: 深度学习替代模型能够以计算效率更高的方式准确预测波浪高度，适用于沿海规划中的风险评估需求。

Abstract: Coastal planners using probabilistic risk assessments to evaluate structural
flood risk reduction projects may wish to simulate the hydrodynamics associated
with large suites of tropical cyclones in large ensembles of landscapes: with
and without projects' implementation; over decades of their useful lifetimes;
and under multiple scenarios reflecting uncertainty about sea level rise, land
subsidence, and other factors. Wave action can be a substantial contributor to
flood losses and overtopping of structural features like levees and floodwalls,
but numerical methods solving for wave dynamics are computationally expensive,
potentially limiting budget-constrained planning efforts. In this study, we
present and evaluate the performance of deep learning-based surrogate models
for predicting peak significant wave heights under a variety of relevant use
cases: predicting waves with or without modeled peak storm surge as a feature,
predicting wave heights while simultaneously predicting peak storm surge, or
using storm surge predicted by another surrogate model as an input feature. All
models incorporate landscape morphological elements (e.g., elevation,
roughness, canopy) and global boundary conditions (e.g., sea level) in addition
to tropical cyclone characteristics as predictive features to improve accuracy
as landscapes evolve over time. Using simulations from Louisiana's 2023 Coastal
Master Plan as a case study, we demonstrate suitable accuracy of surrogate
models for planning-level studies, with a two-sided Kolmogorov-Smirnov test
indicating no significant difference between significant wave heights generated
by the Simulating Waves Nearshore model and those predicted by our surrogate
models in approximately 89% of grid cells and landscapes evaluated in the
study, with performance varying by landscape and model. On average, the models
produced a root mean squared error of 0.05-0.06 m.

Motivation: 评估意大利可再生能源社区(RECs)对电力批发市场的经济影响，特别是分析REC驱动的容量注入和自消耗对市场均衡的影响。

Method: 结合自下而上工程方法和短期经济影响评估，首先绘制意大利RECs分布图，建立代表性配置模型，生成不同用户类别的能源注入和自消耗曲线，然后使用合成反事实方法分析不同情景下的市场影响。

Result: REC部署在大多数时间增加日间均衡电量，在寒冷月份减少均衡电量；具有降低批发电价的潜力；通过提高自消耗减少电网交换，减轻配电网压力。

Abstract: This paper evaluates the economic impact of Renewable Energy Communities
(RECs) on the Italian wholesale power market. Combining a bottom-up engineering
approach with a short-run economic impact assessment, the study begins by
mapping existing and emerging RECs in Italy. We identify key characteristics of
RECs, such as average installed capacity, institutional profiles of members,
types of renewable systems used, and distribution across Italy's electricity
market zones. This mapping yields representative REC configurations, which are
employed within a bottom-up engineering model to generate energy injection and
self-consumption profiles for different REC prosumer and producer categories
(residential, public, small and medium enterprise, non-profit organization, and
standalone installation), considering the different levels of solar irradiance
in Italy based on latitude. These zonal results, aggregated on an hourly basis,
inform the implementation of the synthetic counterfactual approach, which
develops alternative scenarios (e.g., 5 GW target for REC-driven capacity set
by Italian policy for 2027) to assess the impact of REC-driven injection and
self-consumption on the Italian day-ahead power market. The findings suggest
that REC deployment can increase equilibrium quantities during daylight in most
of the time, while decreasing equilibrium quantities mostly during the cold
months, as electrified heating drives greater self-consumption and offsets
lower grid injections. Both positive and negative effects on equilibrium
quantities suggest that REC deployment also has a potential to reduce wholesale
electricity prices. Moreover, by reducing grid exchanges through higher
self-consumption, REC proliferation can alleviate pressure on the distribution
system.

TL;DR: 模型辅助估计方法（特别是简单回归估计器SRE）在土壤有机碳监测中能提高精度而不牺牲无偏性，当样本量n>40时表现可靠，与辅助变量相关性强时可实现30%的精度提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 土壤有机碳封存项目需要平衡采样成本与监管要求的不确定性减少，传统设计型估计器无法利用辅助数据，而模型型方法需要独立验证，模型辅助估计提供了稳健的折中方案。

Method: 通过广泛的模拟研究评估简单回归估计器(SRE)，涵盖不同的SOC存量方差、样本量和模型性能，评估经验偏差、置信区间覆盖率和相对于Horvitz-Thompson估计器的精度增益。

Result: 当n>40时SRE表现出可忽略的偏差和有效的覆盖概率；与辅助变量相关性高时(r²=0.3)可实现30%的精度提升；无相关性时性能收敛于HTE；样本量低于40时不确定性估计不可靠。

Conclusion: 模型辅助估计能增强项目经济性而不损害科学严谨性，监管机构应允许此类估计器但需设定最小样本量阈值，项目方应在存在相关辅助变量时常规使用此类估计器，行业应优先获取高质量的项目特定协变量。

Abstract: Soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration projects require unbiased, precise
and cost-effective Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) systems that
balance sampling costs against uncertainty deductions imposed by regulatory
frameworks. Design-based estimators guarantee unbiasedness but cannot exploit
auxiliary data. Model-based approaches (VCS Methodology VT0014 v1.0 (2025)) can
improve precision but require independent validation for each project.
Model-assisted estimation offers a robust compromise, combining model
predictions with probability sampling to retain design-based guarantees while
improving precision. We evaluate the scientific integrity and efficiency of the
simple regression estimator (SRE), a well-known model-assisted estimator, via
an extensive simulation study. Our simulations span diverse SOC stock
variances, sample sizes, and model performances. We assess three core
properties: empirical bias, empirical confidence interval coverage, and
precision gain relative to the design-based Horvitz-Thompson estimator (HTE).
Results show negligible bias and valid coverage probabilities for n > 40,
regardless of SOC stock variance. Below this threshold, variance approximations
and normality assumptions yield unreliable uncertainty estimates. With
correlated ancillary variables (r^2 = 0.3), SRE achieves 30% precision gains
over HTE. With uncorrelated variables, no gains are observed, but performance
converges to HTE for n >= 40. Model-assisted estimation can enhance project
economics without compromising scientific rigor. Regulators should permit such
estimators while mandating minimum sample size thresholds. Project proponents
should routinely employ such estimators when correlated ancillary variables
exist. The industry should prioritize the retrieval of high-quality,
project-specific covariates to maximize precision gains and thereby the project
economics.

*Marcílio Ferreira dos Santos,Andreza dos Santos Rodrigues de Melo*

Main category: stat.AP

TL;DR: 本研究使用贝叶斯层次时空模型分析2015-2024年累西腓市登革热病例，发现人口密度、家庭规模和滞后降水增加风险，而收入和排水渠道具有保护作用，识别出北部和西部持续高风险区域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 登革热是巴西主要流行病学挑战，存在强烈的城市内部不平等性，受气候和社会环境因素影响，需要分析其时空分布模式以支持公共卫生决策。

Method: 采用R-INLA实现贝叶斯层次时空模型，结合BYM2空间结构和RW1时间成分，纳入人口密度、家庭规模、收入、排水渠道、滞后降水和平均温度等协变量。

Result: 模型拟合良好（DIC=65817；WAIC=64506），人口密度和家庭规模对登革热风险有正向效应，收入和渠道存在具有保护作用，滞后降水增加风险，高温呈反向关联。识别出北部和西部持续高风险集群。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯模型能重现历史模式并支持概率预测和早期预警系统，相比传统模型能明确整合不确定性和时空依赖性，为城市健康管理提供可信区间推断。

Abstract: Dengue remains one of Brazil's major epidemiological challenges, marked by
strong intra-urban inequalities and the influence of climatic and
socio-environmental factors. This study analyzed confirmed dengue cases in
Recife from 2015 to 2024 using a Bayesian hierarchical spatio-temporal model
implemented in R-INLA, combining a BYM2 spatial structure with an RW1 temporal
component. Covariates included population density, household size, income,
drainage channels, lagged precipitation, and mean temperature. Population
density and household size had positive effects on dengue risk, while income
and channel presence were protective. Lagged precipitation increased risk, and
higher temperatures showed an inverse association, suggesting thermal
thresholds for vector activity. The model achieved good fit (DIC=65817;
WAIC=64506) and stable convergence, with moderate residual spatial
autocorrelation (phi=0.06) and a smooth temporal trend between 2016 and 2019.
Spatio-temporal estimates revealed persistent high-risk clusters in northern
and western Recife, overlapping with areas of higher density and social
vulnerability. Beyond reproducing historical patterns, the Bayesian model
supports probabilistic forecasting and early warning systems. Compared with
classical models (GLM, SAR, GWR, GTWR), INLA explicitly integrates uncertainty
and spatial-temporal dependence, offering credible interval inference for
decision-making in urban health management.

Motivation: 研究旨在识别影响精神健康负担的宏观决定因素，为验证计算精神健康模型和特定地区、年龄段的干预措施提供人口层面的参考。

Method: 使用全球疾病负担2021数据，将年龄标准化残疾调整生命年与18个世界发展指标关联，通过皮尔逊相关、互信息、格兰杰因果和最大信息系数等方法评估依赖关系。

Result: 发现20-39岁年轻人存在显著的时空异质性，耦合关系更强；教育对应低负担，失业对应高负担；经济和技术因素影响时间较短，教育因素影响时间较长。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了在不同时间尺度上起作用的宏观决定因素，为特定地区和年龄段的干预措施提供了重要参考。

Abstract: This paper quantifies the age-stratified global burden of four mental
disorders in 27 regions from 1990 to 2021 using GBD 2021. To put it in detail,
it links the age-standardized years of disability adjustment with 18 world
development indicators across economic, educational, social and information
technology sectors. Then, by means of Pearson correlation, mutual information,
Granger causality and maximum information coefficient and other methods, the
linear, nonlinear and lagged dependency relationships were evaluated. After
research, it was found that there is a very prominent spatio-temporal
heterogeneity among young people aged 20 to 39, and the coupling relationship
is stronger. From the overall situation, education corresponds to a low burden.
Unemployment corresponds to a high burden. Through lag analysis, it can be
known that the influence time of economic and technological factors is
relatively short, while that of educational factors is relatively long. These
results highlight the macro determinants that play a role at different time
scales and also provide population-level references for verifying computational
mental health models and for intervention measures in specific regions and for
specific ages.

Abstract: Control problems frequently arise in scientific and industrial applications,
where the objective is to steer a dynamical system from an initial state to a
desired target state. Recent advances in deep learning and automatic
differentiation have made applying these methods to control problems
increasingly practical. In this paper, we examine the use of neural networks
and modern machine-learning libraries to parameterize control inputs across
discrete-time and continuous-time systems, as well as deterministic and
stochastic dynamics. We highlight applications in multiple domains, including
biology, engineering, physics, and medicine. For continuous-time dynamical
systems, neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs) offer a useful
approach to parameterizing control inputs. For discrete-time systems, we show
how custom control-input parameterizations can be implemented and optimized
using automatic-differentiation methods. Overall, the methods presented provide
practical solutions for control tasks that are computationally demanding or
analytically intractable, making them valuable for complex real-world
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低压配电网功率流可见性有限，传统负荷分析方法过度简化变电站级复杂性，且忽略了变电站间的协同行为，这在低碳技术集成日益增加的背景下尤为突出。

Method: 使用条件扩散模型合成日有功和无功功率曲线，通过传统指标评估时间序列和统计真实性，并进行潮流建模验证。

Result: 合成的负荷曲线在独立和群体层面都是合理的，在更广泛的电力系统背景下具有可信度。

Conclusion: 条件扩散模型能有效生成现实场景，为区域配电网规划和运行提供可靠基础。

Abstract: Limited visibility of power distribution network power flows at the low
voltage level presents challenges to both distribution network operators from a
planning perspective and distribution system operators from a congestion
management perspective. Forestalling these challenges through scenario analysis
is confounded by the lack of realistic and coherent load data across
representative distribution feeders. Load profiling approaches often rely on
summarising demand through typical profiles, which oversimplifies the
complexity of substation-level operations and limits their applicability in
specific power system studies. Sampling methods, and more recently generative
models, have attempted to address this through synthesising representative
loads from historical exemplars; however, while these approaches can
approximate load shapes to a convincing degree of fidelity, the co-behaviour
between substations, which ultimately impacts higher voltage level network
operation, is often overlooked. This limitation will become even more
pronounced with the increasing integration of low-carbon technologies, as
estimates of base loads fail to capture load diversity. To address this gap, a
Conditional Diffusion model for synthesising daily active and reactive power
profiles at the low voltage distribution substation level is proposed. The
evaluation of fidelity is demonstrated through conventional metrics capturing
temporal and statistical realism, as well as power flow modelling. The results
show synthesised load profiles are plausible both independently and as a cohort
in a wider power systems context. The Conditional Diffusion model is
benchmarked against both naive and state-of-the-art models to demonstrate its
effectiveness in producing realistic scenarios on which to base sub-regional
power distribution network planning and operations.

Abstract: This paper proposes a wideband composite sequence impedance model
(WCSIM)-based analysis method to evaluate the interactions in

systems. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated using a permanent
magnet synchronous generator-based weak grid system under a
single-line-to-ground fault (SLGF). Frequency scanning results and controller
hardware-in-loop tests validate both the correctness of the WCSIM and the
effectiveness of the WCSIM-based analysis method.

Conclusion: 该方法能有效控制非线性环境中的非高斯分布，实现对高阶统计矩的精确控制。

Abstract: In highly nonlinear systems such as the ones commonly found in astrodynamics,
Gaussian distributions generally evolve into non-Gaussian distributions. This
paper introduces a method for effectively controlling non-Gaussian
distributions in nonlinear environments using optimized linear feedback
control. This paper utilizes Conjugate Unscented Transformation to quantify the
higher-order statistical moments of non-Gaussian distributions. The formulation
focuses on controlling and constraining the sigma points associated with the
uncertainty quantification, which would thereby reflect the control of the
entire distribution and constraints on the moments themselves. This paper
develops an algorithm to solve this problem with sequential convex programming,
and it is demonstrated through a two-body and three-body example. The examples
show that individual moments can be directly controlled, and the moments are
accurately approximated for non-Gaussian distributions throughout the
controller's time horizon in nonlinear dynamics.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 该研究评估了在电力批发市场中运营的直接空气捕获（DAC）技术的商业化可行性，发现DAC可以通过利用电价波动在低价时段运行，实现成本效益的脱碳转型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前脱碳努力不足以实现净零温室气体排放目标，需要大规模二氧化碳去除方法如DAC，但DAC的巨大能耗带来了集成挑战。

Method: 建模了四种商业DAC技术，在加州、德州和纽约三个代表性地点分析其运营，考察在电力批发市场购电并利用碳激励获得收入的情况。

Result: 商业DAC运营可以利用电价波动在低价时段战略性运行；环境温湿度对减排能力有显著影响；利润驱动决策会降低DAC容量因子和总CO2去除量。

Conclusion: 周期更短、灵活性更高的DAC技术能更好利用电价波动；电力市场存在持续低价窗口期，常与低电网排放期重合；存在利润驱动运营的最优激励设计，而电价中的碳税政策对DAC系统适得其反。

Abstract: Current decarbonization efforts are falling short of meeting the net-zero
greenhouse gas (GHG) emission target, highlighting the need for substantial
carbon dioxide removal methods such as direct air capture (DAC). However,
integrating DACs poses challenges due to their enormous power consumption. This
study assesses the commercial operation of various DAC technologies that earn
revenue using monetized carbon incentives while purchasing electricity from
wholesale power markets. We model four commercial DAC technologies and examine
their operation in three representative locations including California, Texas,
and New York. Our findings reveal that commercial DAC operations can take
financial advantage of the volatile power market to operate only during
low-price periods strategically, offering a pathway to facilitate a
cost-efficient decarbonization transition. The ambient operational environment
such as temperature and relative humidity has non-trivial impact on abatement
capacity. Profit-driven decisions introduce climate-economic trade-offs that
might decrease the capacity factor of DAC and reduce total CO2 removal. These
implications extend throughout the entire lifecycle of DAC developments and
influence power systems and policies related to full-scale DAC implementation.
Our study shows that DAC technologies with shorter cycle spans and higher
flexibility can better exploit the electricity price volatility, while power
markets demonstrate persistent low-price windows that often synergize with low
grid emission periods, like during the solar "duck curve" in California. An
optimal incentive design exists for profit-driven operations while carbon-tax
policy in electricity pricing is counterproductive for DAC systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 240V热泵热水器需要安装240V电路，增加了50%以上的前期成本；120V热泵热水器通常需要恒温储存高温水来确保舒适度，但能耗较高。

Method: 开发了模型预测控制系统，使用机器学习预测器集合预测大用水量，实现预热控制；通过时间转移电力负荷来降低能源成本。

Result: 在真实住宅中测试显示：相比240V热泵热水器，在分时电价和小时电价下分别节省23%和28%能源成本；相比恒温储存节省37%能源。

Conclusion: 采用该MPC系统的120V热泵热水器在大多数安装场景下具有经济吸引力，解决了240V电路安装成本高的问题。

Abstract: Electric heat-pump water heaters (HPWHs) could reduce the energy costs,
emissions, and power grid impacts associated with water heating, the
second-largest energy use in United States housing. However, most HPWHs today
require 240 V circuits to power the backup resistance heating elements they use
to maintain comfort during large water draws. Installing a 240 V circuit can
increase the up-front cost of a HPWH by half or more. This paper develops and
field-tests the first control system that enables a 120 V HPWH to efficiently
maintain comfort without resistance heating elements. The novel model
predictive control (MPC) system enables pre-heating in anticipation of large
water draws, which it forecasts using an ensemble of machine learning
predictors. By shifting electrical load over time, MPC also reduces energy
costs on average by 23% and 28% under time-of-use pricing and hourly pricing,
respectively, relative to a 240 V HPWH with standard controls. Compared to the
increasingly common practice in 120 V HPWHs of storing water at a constant,
high temperature (60 {\deg}C) to ensure comfort, MPC saves 37% energy on
average. In addition to demonstrating MPC's benefits in a real, occupied house,
this paper discusses implementation challenges and costs. A simple payback
analysis suggests that a 120 V HPWH, operated by the MPC system developed here,
would be economically attractive in most installation scenarios.

Abstract: Electric vehicle (EV) public charging infrastructure planning faces
significant challenges in competitive markets, where multiple service providers
affect congestion and user behavior. This work extends existing modeling
frameworks by incorporating the presence of competitors' stations and more
realistic queueing systems.
  First, we analyze three finite queueing systems, M/M/1/K, M/M/s/K, and
M/Er/s/K, with varying numbers of servers (charging outlets) and service time
distributions, deriving analytic expressions for user behavior metrics. Second,
we embed the queueing-based user behavior model into a bilevel program, where
the upper level locates new charging stations to maximize accessibility
(throughput), and the lower level captures users' station choices via a user
equilibrium. Third, we apply a reformulation from competitive congested
user-choice facility location models to approximately solve the bilevel problem
and introduce a surrogate-based heuristic to enhance scalability. Fourth, we
showcase our methodology on a real-world case study of an urban area in
Montreal (Canada), offering managerial insights into how user-choice behavior
assumptions and competition affect throughput and location decisions. The
results demonstrate that our model yields (re)location strategies that
outperform the existing network. More broadly, this approach provides a tool
for incorporating charging service quality-through queueing metrics-and
existing competition into station planning.

Conclusion: 该指标方法能够有效选择母线进行分裂优化，无需逐个测试电网中的所有母线，显著提高了计算效率。

Abstract: Rising electricity demand and the growing integration of renewables are
intensifying congestion in transmission grids. Grid topology optimization
through busbar splitting (BuS) and optimal transmission switching can alleviate
grid congestion and reduce the generation costs in a power system. However, BuS
optimization requires a large number of binary variables, and analyzing all the
substations for potential new topological actions is computationally
intractable, particularly in large grids. To tackle this issue, we propose a
set of metrics to identify and rank promising candidates for BuS, focusing on
finding buses where topology optimization can reduce generation costs. To
assess the effect of BuS on the identified buses, we use a combined
mixed-integer convex-quadratic BuS model to compute the optimal topology and
test it with the non-linear non-convex AC optimal power flow (OPF) simulation
to show its AC feasibility. By testing and validating the proposed metrics on
test cases of different sizes, we show that they are able to identify busbars
that reduce the total generation costs when their topology is optimized. Thus,
the metrics enable effective selection of busbars for BuS, with no need to test
every busbar in the grid, one at a time.

Result: 研究发现维持所谓零燃料CW轨迹所需的GNC脉冲操作代表了CW模型的不匹配程度，自然运动并不比强制运动更省燃料。

Conclusion: 自然运动并不比强制运动更省油，这为延长轨道操作提供了可能性，因为强制运动具有更高的燃料效率。

Abstract: This paper compares the required fuel usage for forced and unforced motion of
a chaser satellite engaged in Rendezvous, Proximity Operations, and Docking
(RPOD) maneuvers. Improved RPOD models are vital, particularly as the space
industry expands and demands for improved fuel efficiency, cost effectiveness,
and mission life span increase. This paper specifically examines the Clohessy-
Wiltshire (CW) Equations and the extent of model mismatch by comparing pre-
dicted trajectories from this model with a more computationally complex, higher
fidelity RPOD model. This paper assesses several test cases of similar mission
parameters, in each case comparing natural motion circumnavigation (NMC) with
comparable forced motion circumnavigation. The Guidance, Navigation, and Con-
trol (GNC) impulse maneuvers required to maintain the supposedly zero fuel CW
trajectories is representative of the extent of CW model mismatch. This paper
demonstrates that unforced motions are not inherently more fuel efficient than
forced motions, thus permitting extended orbital operations given the higher
fuel efficiency.

Abstract: Cloud-assisted system identification and control have emerged as practical
solutions for low-power, resource-constrained control systems such as
micro-UAVs. In a typical cloud-assisted setting, state and input data are
transmitted from local agents to a central computer over low-bandwidth wireless
links, leading to quantization. This paper investigates the impact of state and
input data quantization on a linear time invariant (LTI) system identification,
derives a worst-case bound on the identification error, and develops a robust
controller for guaranteed cost control. We establish a fundamental bound on the
model error that depends only on the quantized data and quantization
resolution, and develop a linear matrix inequality (LMI) based guaranteed cost
robust controller under this error bound.

Abstract: Many industrial sites rely on diesel-powered light-duty trucks to transport
workers and small-scale facilities, which has resulted in a significant amount
of greenhouse emissions (GHGs). To address this, we developed a two-stage
robust charging infrastructure planning model for electrifying light-duty
trucks at industrial sites. The model is formulated as a mixed-integer linear
programming (MILP) that optimizes the charging infrastructure, selected from
multiple charger types and potential locations, and determines opportunity
charging schedules for each truck based on the chosen infrastructure. Given the
strict stopping points and schedules at industrial sites, we introduced a
scheduling problem with abandonment, where trucks forgo charging if their
waiting times exceed a maximum threshold. We also further incorporated the
impacts of overnight charging and range anxiety on waiting and abandonment
behaviors. To represent the stochastic and heterogeneous parking durations of
trucks, we constructed a decision-dependent robust uncertainty set in which
parking time variability flexibly depends on charging choices. We applied the
model in a case study of an open-pit mining site, which plans charger
installations in eight zones and schedules a fleet of around 200 trucks. By
decomposing the problem into monthly subproblems and using heuristic
approaches, for the whole-year dataset, the model achieves an optimality gap of
less than 0.1 % within a reasonable computation time under diverse uncertainty
scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出一种概率安全证书来处理自动驾驶中的潜在风险（遮挡风险），通过概率不变性放松严格的可观测性要求，提供线性动作约束来限制潜在风险概率在容忍范围内。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于集合不变性的模型驱动控制技术只能处理可见风险，而遮挡会产生潜在风险；数据驱动技术也难以学习没有可见风险关键对象时的安全动作映射。

Method: 应用概率不变性技术，放松严格的可观测性要求，提供线性动作约束来限制潜在风险概率在容忍范围内，可集成到模型预测控制器或数据驱动策略中。

Result: 在CARLA模拟器中测试并与现有技术比较，理论和实证分析表明该方法能在遮挡环境中保证实时控制的长期安全性，不过于保守且对暴露风险具有透明度。

Conclusion: 提出的概率安全证书方法能有效处理自动驾驶中的潜在风险，在遮挡环境中提供安全保证，平衡了安全性和实用性。

Abstract: Ensuring safe autonomous driving in the presence of occlusions poses a
significant challenge in its policy design. While existing model-driven control
techniques based on set invariance can handle visible risks, occlusions create
latent risks in which safety-critical states are not observable. Data-driven
techniques also struggle to handle latent risks because direct mappings from
risk-critical objects in sensor inputs to safe actions cannot be learned
without visible risk-critical objects. Motivated by these challenges, in this
paper, we propose a probabilistic safety certificate for latent risk. Our key
technical enabler is the application of probabilistic invariance: It relaxes
the strict observability requirements imposed by set-invariance methods that
demand the knowledge of risk-critical states. The proposed techniques provide
linear action constraints that confine the latent risk probability within
tolerance. Such constraints can be integrated into model predictive controllers
or embedded in data-driven policies to mitigate latent risks. The proposed
method is tested using the CARLA simulator and compared with a few existing
techniques. The theoretical and empirical analysis jointly demonstrate that the
proposed methods assure long-term safety in real-time control in occluded
environments without being overly conservative and with transparency to exposed
risks.

*Fuma Omori,Atsushi Yano,Takuya Azumi*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对DAG任务集的概率可调度性分析方法，通过任务集分区和分箱打包启发式算法，在分区调度下保证概率可调度性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶系统需要实时保证，但加速特性导致执行时间通常低于最坏情况，因此概率保证比最坏情况保证更适合这类系统。

Method: 利用单处理器概率保证的研究成果，提出任务集分区方法，在分区调度下保证可调度性，并比较了四种分箱打包启发式算法。

Result: 在随机生成的DAG任务集上评估，相比现有方法，提出的方法能调度更多任务集且平均分析时间更短，其中Item-Centric Worst-Fit-Decreasing启发式表现最佳。

Conclusion: 提出的概率可调度性分析方法有效提升了DAG任务集的调度性能，为自动驾驶等安全关键系统提供了更实用的概率保证框架。

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems, critical for safety, require real-time guarantees
and can be modeled as DAGs. Their acceleration features, such as caches and
pipelining, often result in execution times below the worst-case. Thus, a
probabilistic approach ensuring constraint satisfaction within a probability
threshold is more suitable than worst-case guarantees for these systems. This
paper considers probabilistic guarantees for DAG tasks by utilizing the results
of probabilistic guarantees for single processors, which have been relatively
more advanced than those for multi-core processors. This paper proposes a task
set partitioning method that guarantees schedulability under the partitioned
scheduling. The evaluation on randomly generated DAG task sets demonstrates
that the proposed method schedules more task sets with a smaller mean analysis
time compared to existing probabilistic schedulability analysis for DAGs. The
evaluation also compares four bin-packing heuristics, revealing Item-Centric
Worst-Fit-Decreasing schedules the most task sets.

Method: 提出使用两个相关变量数据集的一般方法学，并在瑞典的COVID-19疫苗接种率与政治参与数据上进行测试。

Result: 模型成功捕捉了数据中显示的意见隔离现象，证明空间相关的偏见对结果是必要的；而偏见混合则导致更均匀的意见分布和多数意见的更大渗透。

Conclusion: 多极意见动力学模型能有效模拟现实世界中的意见隔离现象，空间相关的偏见是产生观察结果的关键因素。

Abstract: We perform a validation analysis on the multipolar model of opinion dynamics.
A general methodology for using the model on datasets of two correlated

COVID-19 vaccination rates and political participation in Sweden. The model is
shown to successfully capture the opinion segregation demonstrated by the data
and spatial correlation of biases is demonstrated as necessary for the result.
A mixing of the biases on the other hand leads to a more homogeneous opinion
distribution, and greater penetration of the majority opinion, which here
corresponds to a decision to vote or vaccinate.

TL;DR: 该研究以瑞士Walenstadt配电网为案例，分析分布式可再生能源和灵活设备的聚合灵活性潜力，发现热泵和光伏系统能显著增强配电网灵活性，但灵活性随设备渗透率增加呈非线性变化，受电网拓扑和网络约束影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着分布式可再生能源发电和供热、交通电气化的快速发展，现代配电网中灵活设备数量急剧增加，需要利用这些小型分布式资源的聚合灵活性来维持未来电网的稳定性。

Method: 使用瑞士Walenstadt配电网作为案例研究，分析热泵、光伏系统等灵活设备的聚合灵活性潜力，研究其时间变化特性和季节性特征，并模拟未来不同设备渗透率场景。

Result: 研究表明，热泵和光伏系统的引入显著增强了配电网灵活性，但聚合灵活性随设备渗透率增加呈非线性变化，主要由于单个馈线过载问题，凸显了电网拓扑和网络约束对灵活性潜力的重要影响。

Conclusion: 配电网的聚合灵活性潜力受电网拓扑和网络约束的显著影响，不能简单地假设随灵活设备渗透率增加而线性增长，需要在电网规划中考虑这些约束因素。

Abstract: The growing integration of distributed renewable generation and the
electrification of heating and transportation are rapidly increasing the number
of flexible devices within modern distribution grids. Leveraging the aggregated
flexibility of these small-scale distributed resources is essential to
maintaining future grid-wide stability. This work uses the Swiss distribution
grid of Walenstadt as a case study to provide insights into the aggregated
flexibility potential of distribution grids. It demonstrates that incorporating
devices such as heat pumps and photovoltaic systems significantly enhances
distribution grid flexibility. It investigates the time-varying nature of
aggregated flexibility and highlights how it can vary seasonally. Furthermore,
simulations of future scenarios reveal that aggregated flexibility does not
increase linearly or monotonically with higher levels of flexible device
penetration. This is primarily due to the overloading of individual feeders,
which underscores the impact of grid topology and network constraints on the
aggregated flexibility potential.

TL;DR: 提出双物理信息神经网络框架，通过两个互补网络解决车辆碰撞动力学预测中的计算效率、精度和数据需求之间的权衡问题。


<details>

Motivation: 现有车辆碰撞动力学预测方法在计算效率、预测精度和数据需求之间存在固有权衡，无法同时满足实时应用和安全关键控制的需求。

Method: 使用双PINN框架：第一个网络结合高斯混合模型和PINN架构从有限元分析数据中学习碰撞力分布；第二个网络采用自适应PINN预测碰撞后车辆动力学，包含自适应物理防护层。

Result: 碰撞力模型在FEA数据集上力预测相对误差低于15.0%；车辆动力学模型相比传统四自由度模型在缩比车辆实验中平均轨迹预测误差减少63.6%；系统保持毫秒级计算效率。

Conclusion: 该框架在精度、效率和实时性方面显著优于现有方法，适用于精确固定技术场景和一般碰撞动力学预测，为安全关键控制提供概率置信边界。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of vehicle collision dynamics is crucial for advanced
safety systems and post-impact control applications, yet existing methods face
inherent trade-offs among computational efficiency, prediction accuracy, and
data requirements. This paper proposes a dual Physics-Informed Neural Network
framework addressing these challenges through two complementary networks. The
first network integrates Gaussian Mixture Models with PINN architecture to
learn impact force distributions from finite element analysis data while
enforcing momentum conservation and energy consistency constraints. The second
network employs an adaptive PINN with dynamic constraint weighting to predict
post-collision vehicle dynamics, featuring an adaptive physics guard layer that
prevents unrealistic predictions whil e preserving data-driven learning
capabilities. The framework incorporates uncertainty quantification through
time-varying parameters and enables rapid adaptation via fine-tuning
strategies. Validation demonstrates significant improvements: the impact force
model achieves relative errors below 15.0% for force prediction on finite
element analysis (FEA) datasets, while the vehicle dynamics model reduces
average trajectory prediction error by 63.6% compared to traditional
four-degree-of-freedom models in scaled vehicle experiments. The integrated
system maintains millisecond-level computational efficiency suitable for
real-time applications while providing probabilistic confidence bounds
essential for safety-critical control. Comprehensive validation through FEA
simulation, dynamic modeling, and scaled vehicle experiments confirms the
framework's effectiveness for Precision Immobilization Technique scenarios and
general collision dynamics prediction.

Motivation: 向完全脱碳电力系统转型需要整合确保可靠性的新技术，但缺失的风险市场通过使投资者面临收入不确定性，阻碍了对可靠性增强技术的投资。

Method: 开发了一个具有风险规避市场参与者的两阶段随机均衡模型，独立确定功率和能量容量，并应用于英国深度脱碳电力系统的案例研究。

Result: 结果显示，收入波动导致LDES产生显著风险溢价和更高融资成本，成为其大规模部署的障碍。不完整的风险市场会减少社会福利、损害可靠性，并抑制对LDES等收入波动技术的投资。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，需要政策机制来对冲收入风险，以降低资本成本并加速对可靠性增强的零碳技术的投资。

Abstract: The transition to a fully decarbonised electricity system depends on
integrating new technologies that ensure reliability alongside sustainability.
However, missing risk markets hinder investment in reliability-enhancing
technologies by exposing investors to revenue uncertainty. This study provides
the first quantitative assessment of how missing risk markets affect investment
decisions in power systems that depend on long-duration energy storage (LDES)
for reliability. We develop a two-stage stochastic equilibrium model with
risk-averse market participants, which independently sizes power and energy
capacity. We apply the method to a case study of a deeply decarbonised power
system in Great Britain. The results show that incomplete risk markets reduce
social welfare, harm reliability, and discourage investment in LDES and other
technologies with volatile revenue streams. Revenue volatility leads to
substantial risk premiums and higher financing costs for LDES, creating a
barrier to its large-scale deployment. These findings demonstrate the
importance of policy mechanisms that hedge revenue risk to lower the cost of
capital and accelerate investment in reliability-enhancing, zero-carbon
technologies

Motivation: 将NOMA技术应用于飞机通信面临飞机高速运动（最高214米/秒）和长通信距离（最高250公里）带来的挑战，导致显著的多普勒频移和低信噪比，需要准确评估这些挑战。

Method: 使用基于几何的随机空地信道模型，比较Zadoff-Chu序列与时分方法的信道估计性能，分析不同载波频偏预补偿精度，并评估零迫检测器和最小均方误差检测器在连续干扰消除下的中断概率。

Result: 结果显示，由于起飞降落阶段和巡航阶段具有不同的信道传播特性，最优的信道估计器-检测器组合在这两个阶段有所不同。

Conclusion: 在飞机通信系统中，需要根据飞行阶段的不同信道特性选择相应的信道估计和检测方案，以实现最佳性能。

Abstract: This paper investigates a multiple antenna system with non-orthogonal
multiple access (NOMA) for the exchange of air traffic management data between
commercial aircraft pilots and ground-based air traffic controllers. While NOMA
techniques enhance spectral efficiency, their application to aircraft
communications is challenged by the high speed of the aircraft (up to 214 m/s)
and the long communication ranges (up to 250 km), resulting in significant
Doppler shifts and low signal-to-noise ratios, respectively. To accurately
assess these challenges, we employ a realistic geometry-based stochastic
air-ground channel model, derived from dedicated flight measurement campaigns.
In this paper, multiple aircraft simultaneously transmit data to the ground
station. We focus on the channel estimation problem at the ground station under
high carrier frequency offsets and the effects of channel aging due to
channel's time-varying nature. For the channel estimation problem, we compare
the Zadoff-Chu sequences with time-division approach under varying carrier
frequency offset pre-compensation accuracies at the aircraft transmitter. For
the channel aging problem and performance evaluation of channel estimators, we
compute the outage probability for both the zero-forcing detector and the
minimum mean squared error detector with successive interference cancellation.
The results show that the favorable channel estimator-detector combinations
differ between the takeoff & landing phase and the enroute cruise phase of the
flight, due to the distinct channel propagation characteristics of each phase.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于高频开盘至收盘收益数据的协方差估计方法面临统计精度与定位能力之间的权衡问题，需要新的框架来克服这一限制。

Method: 使用高频K线数据（包含开盘、最高、最低、收盘价），开发新的协方差估计框架和推断检验方法。

Result: 相比基准方法提高了估计精度，保持了局部结构，检验方法在样本较小时具有合理的尺寸控制和显著提高的检验功效。实证分析显示IBIT比特币ETF存在系统性偏离市场中性，尤其在市场压力时期。

Conclusion: 基于K线数据的协方差估计框架有效解决了传统方法的权衡问题，能够检测到对相对温和信息事件的微妙响应变化。

Abstract: Spot covariance estimation is commonly based on high-frequency open-to-close
return data over short time windows, but such approaches face a trade-off
between statistical accuracy and localization. In this paper, I introduce a new
estimation framework using high-frequency candlestick data, which include open,
high, low, and close prices, effectively addressing this trade-off. By
exploiting the information contained in candlesticks, the proposed method
improves estimation accuracy relative to benchmarks while preserving local
structure. I further develop a test for spot covariance inference based on
candlesticks that demonstrates reasonable size control and a notable increase
in power, particularly in small samples. Motivated by recent work in the
finance literature, I empirically test the market neutrality of the iShares
Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) using 1-minute candlestick data for the full year of
2024. The results show systematic deviations from market neutrality, especially
in periods of market stress. An event study around FOMC announcements further
illustrates the new method's ability to detect subtle shifts in response to
relatively mild information events.

Motivation: 传统参数方法可能会施加虚假的空间模式，无法正确识别边界不存在的情况。需要一种灵活的非参数方法来检测参数模型会遗漏的复杂空间模式。

Method: 采用局部线性回归结合数据驱动带宽选择，通过蒙特卡洛模拟验证方法性能，并应用于2015-2020年银行分支机构开业数据，匹配5743个新分行与590万抵押贷款申请。

Result: 分行邻近度显著影响贷款申请量（每10英里下降8.5%），但不影响批准率；在数字转型时代（2010-2023），分行生存与区域收入呈非单调关系，高收入地区反而有更多关闭。

Conclusion: 灵活的非参数方法对于检测复杂空间模式是必要的，这些模式会被参数模型遗漏；研究挑战了关于银行荒漠的简化叙述，揭示了空间整合决策背后的组织复杂性。

Abstract: I develop a nonparametric framework for identifying spatial boundaries of
treatment effects without imposing parametric functional form restrictions. The
method employs local linear regression with data-driven bandwidth selection to
flexibly estimate spatial decay patterns and detect treatment effect
boundaries. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the nonparametric approach
exhibits lower bias and correctly identifies the absence of boundaries when
none exist, unlike parametric methods that may impose spurious spatial
patterns. I apply this framework to bank branch openings during 2015--2020,
matching 5,743 new branches to 5.9 million mortgage applications across 14,209
census tracts. The analysis reveals that branch proximity significantly affects
loan application volume (8.5\% decline per 10 miles) but not approval rates,
consistent with branches stimulating demand through local presence while credit
decisions remain centralized. Examining branch survival during the digital
transformation era (2010--2023), I find a non-monotonic relationship with area
income: high-income areas experience more closures despite conventional wisdom.
This counterintuitive pattern reflects strategic consolidation of redundant
branches in over-banked wealthy urban areas rather than discrimination against
poor neighborhoods. Controlling for branch density, urbanization, and
competition, the direct income effect diminishes substantially, with branch
density emerging as the primary determinant of survival. These findings
demonstrate the necessity of flexible nonparametric methods for detecting
complex spatial patterns that parametric models would miss, and challenge
simplistic narratives about banking deserts by revealing the organizational
complexity underlying spatial consolidation decisions.

Method: 基于Moravec悖论，对19,000个O*NET任务在性能方差、隐性知识、数据丰富度和算法差距四个维度进行评分，构建自动化暴露指数。

Result: 管理、STEM和科学职业暴露度最高，维护、农业和建筑职业最低。工资与暴露度正相关，隐性知识与工资正相关。与Eloundou等人的AI标注方法相关性达0.72，与前LLM指数无正相关。

Conclusion: 该指数识别根本可自动化性而非当前能力，验证了AI标注方法，表明自动化模式发生范式转变，挑战了技能偏向型技术变革的传统观点。

Abstract: This paper develops a theory-driven automation exposure index based on
Moravec's Paradox. Scoring 19,000 O*NET tasks on performance variance, tacit
knowledge, data abundance, and algorithmic gaps reveals that management, STEM,
and sciences occupations show the highest exposure. In contrast, maintenance,
agriculture, and construction show the lowest. The positive relationship
between wages and exposure challenges the notion of skill-biased technological
change if AI substitutes for workers. At the same time, tacit knowledge
exhibits a positive relationship with wages consistent with seniority-biased
technological change. This index identifies fundamental automatability rather
than current capabilities, while also validating the AI annotation method
pioneered by Eloundou et al. (2024) with a correlation of 0.72. The
non-positive relationship with pre-LLM indices suggests a paradigm shift in

Motivation: 建立统一的市场交易描述框架，将单一证券、所有市场证券和市场组合的交易纳入同一分析体系，揭示传统投资组合理论在交易量随机性方面的局限性。

Method: 通过观察投资者在平均区间内对市场所有证券的当前交易时间序列，将其转换为模拟单一证券和模拟市场组合的交易时间序列，建立统一的收益和方差描述方法。

Result: 市场基础方差在假设连续交易量恒定时简化为Markowitz投资组合方差，表明Markowitz方差忽略了交易量随机变化的影响；比较了市场组合与所有市场证券交易的市场基础方差，分析了平均区间持续时间的重要性。

Conclusion: 该方法可推广到任何投资组合及其证券交易的收益和方差描述，但预测精度受限于高斯分布的经济障碍。

Abstract: We present the unified market-based description of returns and variances of
the trades with shares of a particular security, of the trades with shares of
all securities in the market, and of the trades with the market portfolio. We
consider the investor who doesn't trade the shares of his portfolio he
collected at time t0 in the past. The investor observes the time series of the
current trades with all securities made in the market during the averaging
interval. The investor may convert these time series into the time series that
model the trades with all securities as the trades with a single security and
into the time series that model the trades with the market portfolio as the
trades with a single security. That establishes the same description of the
returns and variances of the trades with a single security, the trades with all
securities in the market, and the market portfolio. We show that the
market-based variance, which accounts for the impact of random change of the
volumes of consecutive trades with securities, takes the form of Markowitz's
(1952) portfolio variance if the volumes of consecutive trades with all market
securities are assumed constant. That highlights that Markowitz's (1952)
variance ignores the effects of random volumes of consecutive trades. We
compare the market-based variances of the market portfolio and of the trades
with all market securities, consider the importance of the duration of the
averaging interval, and explain the economic obstacles that limit the accuracy
of the predictions of the returns and variances at best by Gaussian
distributions. The same methods describe the returns and variances of any
portfolio and the trades with its securities.

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: 本文分析了美国平价医疗法案市场保险的参保情况，研究了如何优化州级补充补贴来应对2026年联邦保费补贴到期可能导致的覆盖损失。研究发现低收入人群对保费补贴最敏感，州级补贴可以有效缓解但无法完全阻止覆盖损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 2026年联邦增强保费税收抵免补贴即将到期，预计将导致700多万美国人失去医疗保险覆盖。虽然已有10个州创建了补充市场补贴，但如何最优构建这些补贴以最大化覆盖范围的研究很少。

Method: 使用马里兰州市场的行政参保数据估计市场保险需求，然后基于估计参数和不同预算约束，模拟如何最优分配州级补充保费补贴来缓解补贴到期造成的覆盖损失。

Result: 收入低于联邦贫困线200%的参保人对保费补贴最敏感，每月额外10美元补贴可使覆盖概率提高约6.5个百分点。模拟显示每1000万美元年度州补贴可保留约5000名参保人，但一旦所有低于200%贫困线的参保人获得全额补贴，补贴的成本效益显著下降。

Conclusion: 各州可以有效缓解但无法完全阻止联邦增强保费税收抵免补贴到期造成的覆盖损失，需要优化补贴分配策略。

Abstract: Enrollment in the Health Insurance Marketplaces created by the Affordable
Care Act reached an all-time high of approximately 25 million Americans in
2025, roughly doubling since enhanced premium tax credit subsidies were made
available in 2021. The scheduled expiration of enhanced subsidies in 2026 is
estimated to leave over seven million Americans without health insurance
coverage. Ten states have created supplemental Marketplace subsidies, yet
little attention has been paid to how to best structure these subsidies to
maximize coverage. Using administrative enrollment data from Maryland's
Marketplace, we estimate demand for Marketplace coverage. Then, using estimated
parameters and varying budget constraints, we simulate how to optimally
allocate supplemental state premium subsidies to mitigate coverage losses from
enhanced premium subsidy expiration. We find that premium sensitivity is
greatest among enrollees with incomes below 200 percent of the federal poverty
level, where the marginal effect of an additional ten dollars in monthly
subsidies on the probability of coverage is approximately 6.5 percentage
points, and decreases to roughly 2.5 percentage points above 200 percent FPL.
Simulation results indicate that each 10 million dollars in annual state
subsidies could retain roughly 5,000 enrollees, though the cost-effectiveness
of these subsidies falls considerably once all enrollees below 200 percent of
the federal poverty level are fully subsidized. We conclude that states are
well positioned to mitigate, but not stop, coverage losses from expanded
premium tax credit subsidy expiration.

Result: 在20个需要细微判断的场景基准测试中，RID框架达到95%的人类对齐分数，显著优于基线(80%)和思维链提示(75%)，并产生更高质量的意图驱动推理。

Conclusion: RID框架提供了一种实用、易用且有效的方法，引导LLMs从字面指令遵循转向自由、目标导向的推理，为更可靠实用的AI代理铺平道路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed as the reasoning
engines for agentic AI systems, yet they exhibit a critical flaw: a rigid
adherence to explicit rules that leads to decisions misaligned with human
common sense and intent. This "rule-rigidity" is a significant barrier to
building trustworthy autonomous agents. While prior work has shown that
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with human explanations can mitigate this issue,
SFT is computationally expensive and inaccessible to many practitioners. To
address this gap, we introduce the Rule-Intent Distinction (RID) Framework, a
novel, low-compute meta-prompting technique designed to elicit human-aligned
exception handling in LLMs in a zero-shot manner. The RID framework provides
the model with a structured cognitive schema for deconstructing tasks,
classifying rules, weighing conflicting outcomes, and justifying its final
decision. We evaluated the RID framework against baseline and Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) prompting on a custom benchmark of 20 scenarios requiring nuanced
judgment across diverse domains. Our human-verified results demonstrate that
the RID framework significantly improves performance, achieving a 95% Human
Alignment Score (HAS), compared to 80% for the baseline and 75% for CoT.
Furthermore, it consistently produces higher-quality, intent-driven reasoning.
This work presents a practical, accessible, and effective method for steering
LLMs from literal instruction-following to liberal, goal-oriented reasoning,
paving the way for more reliable and pragmatic AI agents.

TL;DR: DeepPlanner是一个端到端的强化学习框架，通过熵基优势函数和选择性样本加权来增强深度研究代理的规划能力，在多个基准测试中实现了最先进的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么依赖推理阶段的隐式规划，要么引入显式规划器但没有系统性地优化规划阶段。研究发现，在标准强化学习下，规划标记的熵显著高于其他动作标记，揭示了未优化的不确定决策点。

Method: 提出DeepPlanner框架：1）使用基于熵的优势函数在标记级别分配更大的更新给高熵标记；2）选择性加权规划密集型样本的优势值。

Result: 在七个深度研究基准测试上的广泛实验表明，DeepPlanner提高了规划质量，并在显著降低的训练预算下实现了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: DeepPlanner通过系统性地优化规划阶段，有效增强了深度研究代理的规划能力，证明了熵基优势函数和选择性样本加权的有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) augmented with multi-step reasoning and action
generation abilities have shown promise in leveraging external tools to tackle
complex tasks that require long-horizon planning. However, existing approaches
either rely on implicit planning in the reasoning stage or introduce explicit
planners without systematically addressing how to optimize the planning stage.
As evidence, we observe that under vanilla reinforcement learning (RL),
planning tokens exhibit significantly higher entropy than other action tokens,
revealing uncertain decision points that remain under-optimized. To address
this, we propose DeepPlanner, an end-to-end RL framework that effectively
enhances the planning capabilities of deep research agents. Our approach shapes
token-level advantage with an entropy-based term to allocate larger updates to
high entropy tokens, and selectively upweights sample-level advantages for
planning-intensive rollouts. Extensive experiments across seven deep research
benchmarks demonstrate that DeepPlanner improves planning quality and achieves
state-of-the-art results under a substantially lower training budget.

TL;DR: Sentinel是首个基于形式化时序逻辑的多层次评估框架，用于验证LLM具身智能体在物理环境中的安全性，涵盖语义、规划和轨迹三个层面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖启发式规则或主观LLM判断，缺乏对物理安全的严格形式化评估。需要一种能够精确指定状态不变性、时间依赖性和时序约束的形式化框架。

Method: 采用多级验证流程：语义层面将自然语言安全需求形式化为时序逻辑公式并验证LLM理解；规划层面验证高层动作计划；轨迹层面将执行轨迹合并为计算树进行最终安全检查。

Result: 在VirtualHome和ALFRED环境中评估多个LLM具身智能体，发现Sentinel能够暴露先前方法忽略的安全违规，并提供对失败模式的深入洞察。

Conclusion: 通过将物理安全基于时序逻辑并在多个层面应用验证方法，Sentinel为系统评估LLM具身智能体在物理环境中的安全性提供了严格基础。

Abstract: We present Sentinel, the first framework for formally evaluating the physical
safety of Large Language Model(LLM-based) embodied agents across the semantic,
plan, and trajectory levels. Unlike prior methods that rely on heuristic rules
or subjective LLM judgments, Sentinel grounds practical safety requirements in
formal temporal logic (TL) semantics that can precisely specify state
invariants, temporal dependencies, and timing constraints. It then employs a
multi-level verification pipeline where (i) at the semantic level, intuitive
natural language safety requirements are formalized into TL formulas and the
LLM agent's understanding of these requirements is probed for alignment with
the TL formulas; (ii) at the plan level, high-level action plans and subgoals
generated by the LLM agent are verified against the TL formulas to detect
unsafe plans before execution; and (iii) at the trajectory level, multiple
execution trajectories are merged into a computation tree and efficiently
verified against physically-detailed TL specifications for a final safety
check. We apply Sentinel in VirtualHome and ALFRED, and formally evaluate
multiple LLM-based embodied agents against diverse safety requirements. Our
experiments show that by grounding physical safety in temporal logic and
applying verification methods across multiple levels, Sentinel provides a
rigorous foundation for systematically evaluating LLM-based embodied agents in
physical environments, exposing safety violations overlooked by previous
methods and offering insights into their failure modes.

TL;DR: 提出基于微调大语言模型的框架，自动从交通事故叙述中推断驾驶员危险行为，提高分类的有效性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 两车事故占道路事故约70%，但现有驾驶员危险行为数据因人工编码不一致且劳动密集而可靠性有限。

Method: 使用MTCF五年两车事故数据，微调Llama 3.2 1B模型处理详细事故叙述，并与随机森林、XGBoost、CatBoost和神经网络等传统分类器进行基准比较。

Result: 微调LLM总体准确率达80%，优于所有基线模型，在数据不平衡场景中表现尤为突出。通过概率推理方法分析模型输出变化，发现分心驾驶显著增加"一般不安全驾驶"概率，双方分心最大化"双方危险行为"概率，青少年驾驶显著增加"速度和停车违规"概率。

Conclusion: 该框架和分析方法为大规模自动DHA检测提供了稳健且可解释的解决方案，为交通安全分析和干预开辟了新机会。

Abstract: Vehicle crashes involve complex interactions between road users, split-second
decisions, and challenging environmental conditions. Among these, two-vehicle
crashes are the most prevalent, accounting for approximately 70% of roadway
crashes and posing a significant challenge to traffic safety. Identifying
Driver Hazardous Action (DHA) is essential for understanding crash causation,
yet the reliability of DHA data in large-scale databases is limited by
inconsistent and labor-intensive manual coding practices. Here, we present an
innovative framework that leverages a fine-tuned large language model to
automatically infer DHAs from textual crash narratives, thereby improving the
validity and interpretability of DHA classifications. Using five years of
two-vehicle crash data from MTCF, we fine-tuned the Llama 3.2 1B model on
detailed crash narratives and benchmarked its performance against conventional
machine learning classifiers, including Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, and a
neural network. The fine-tuned LLM achieved an overall accuracy of 80%,
surpassing all baseline models and demonstrating pronounced improvements in
scenarios with imbalanced data. To increase interpretability, we developed a
probabilistic reasoning approach, analyzing model output shifts across original
test sets and three targeted counterfactual scenarios: variations in driver
distraction and age. Our analysis revealed that introducing distraction for one
driver substantially increased the likelihood of "General Unsafe Driving";
distraction for both drivers maximized the probability of "Both Drivers Took
Hazardous Actions"; and assigning a teen driver markedly elevated the
probability of "Speed and Stopping Violations." Our framework and analytical
methods provide a robust and interpretable solution for large-scale automated
DHA detection, offering new opportunities for traffic safety analysis and
intervention.

TL;DR: 本文主张将时间序列分析重新构想为基于大语言模型的推理任务，强调因果结构和可解释性，而非传统的数值回归方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界的时间序列分析需要超越表面趋势，揭示驱动变化的实际力量。现有LLM方法主要利用数值回归能力，忽视了其深层推理潜力。

Method: 将时间序列分析重新定义为推理任务，利用LLM的多模态输入整合能力，重点关注因果结构和可解释性。

Result: 通过这种转变，时间序列分析能够实现更接近人类理解的透明和上下文感知的洞察。

Conclusion: 将LLM作为推理工具而非回归工具，能够使时间序列分析在复杂现实环境中提供更透明、可解释的结果。

Abstract: Traditional time series analysis has long relied on pattern recognition,
trained on static and well-established benchmarks. However, in real-world
settings -- where policies shift, human behavior adapts, and unexpected events
unfold -- effective analysis must go beyond surface-level trends to uncover the
actual forces driving them. The recent rise of Large Language Models (LLMs)
presents new opportunities for rethinking time series analysis by integrating
multimodal inputs. However, as the use of LLMs becomes popular, we must remain
cautious, asking why we use LLMs and how to exploit them effectively. Most
existing LLM-based methods still employ their numerical regression ability and
ignore their deeper reasoning potential. This paper argues for rethinking time
series with LLMs as a reasoning task that prioritizes causal structure and
explainability. This shift brings time series analysis closer to human-aligned
understanding, enabling transparent and context-aware insights in complex
real-world environments.

TL;DR: 提出Preference-Based Reward Repair (PBRR)框架，通过从人类偏好中学习加性修正项来自动修复人工设计的代理奖励函数，解决奖励函数错配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工设计的奖励函数经常与真实目标不匹配，导致奖励黑客问题；而从头学习奖励函数成本高昂。需要一种结合两者优势的方法。

Method: PBRR框架：使用目标探索策略和新的偏好学习目标，从偏好中学习过渡依赖的加性修正项来修复代理奖励函数。

Result: 在表格域中证明PBRR的累积遗憾与现有偏好学习RL方法相当；在奖励黑客基准测试中，PBRR始终优于基线方法，需要更少的偏好就能学习高性能策略。

Conclusion: PBRR能够有效修复错配的奖励函数，比从头学习奖励函数或其他修正方法更高效，为强化学习中的奖励函数设计提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Human-designed reward functions for reinforcement learning (RL) agents are
frequently misaligned with the humans' true, unobservable objectives, and thus
act only as proxies. Optimizing for a misspecified proxy reward function often
induces reward hacking, resulting in a policy misaligned with the human's true
objectives. An alternative is to perform RL from human feedback, which involves
learning a reward function from scratch by collecting human preferences over
pairs of trajectories. However, building such datasets is costly. To address
the limitations of both approaches, we propose Preference-Based Reward Repair
(PBRR): an automated iterative framework that repairs a human-specified proxy
reward function by learning an additive, transition-dependent correction term
from preferences. A manually specified reward function can yield policies that
are highly suboptimal under the ground-truth objective, yet corrections on only
a few transitions may suffice to recover optimal performance. To identify and
correct for those transitions, PBRR uses a targeted exploration strategy and a
new preference-learning objective. We prove in tabular domains PBRR has a
cumulative regret that matches, up to constants, that of prior preference-based
RL methods. In addition, on a suite of reward-hacking benchmarks, PBRR
consistently outperforms baselines that learn a reward function from scratch
from preferences or modify the proxy reward function using other approaches,
requiring substantially fewer preferences to learn high performing policies.

Abstract: Effective assessment of mobile network coverage and the precise
identification of service weak spots are paramount for network operators
striving to enhance user Quality of Experience (QoE). This paper presents a
novel framework for mobile coverage and weak spot analysis utilising
crowdsourced QoE data. The core of our methodology involves coverage analysis
at the individual cell (antenna) level, subsequently aggregated to the site
level, using empirical geolocation data. A key contribution of this research is
the application of One-Class Support Vector Machine (OC-SVM) algorithm for
calculating mobile network coverage. This approach models the decision
hyperplane as the effective coverage contour, facilitating robust calculation
of coverage areas for individual cells and entire sites. The same methodology
is extended to analyse crowdsourced service loss reports, thereby identifying
and quantifying geographically localised weak spots. Our findings demonstrate
the efficacy of this novel framework in accurately mapping mobile coverage and,
crucially, in highlighting granular areas of signal deficiency, particularly
within complex urban environments.

Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has enabled agents to represent
virtual humans in societal simulations, facilitating diverse interactions
within complex social systems. However, existing LLM-based agents exhibit
severe limitations in affective cognition: They fail to simulate the bounded
rationality essential for bridging virtual and real-world services; They lack
empirically validated integration mechanisms embedding emotions within agent
decision architectures. This paper constructs an emotional cognition framework
incorporating desire generation and objective management, designed to achieve
emotion alignment between LLM-based agents and humans, modeling the complete
decision-making process of LLM-based agents, encompassing state evolution,
desire generation, objective optimization, decision generation, and action
execution. This study implements the proposed framework within our proprietary
multi-agent interaction environment. Experimental results demonstrate that
agents governed by our framework not only exhibit behaviors congruent with
their emotional states but also, in comparative assessments against other agent
types, demonstrate superior ecological validity and generate decision outcomes
that significantly more closely approximate human behavioral patterns.

Conclusion: 该互补代理系统在显著降低计算成本的同时，有效维持了任务性能，为LLM应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate that
chain-of-thought prompting and deep reasoning substantially enhance performance
on complex tasks, and multi-agent systems can further improve accuracy by
enabling model debates. However, applying deep reasoning to all problems is
computationally expensive. To mitigate these costs, we propose a complementary
agent system integrating small and large LLMs. The small LLM first generates an
initial answer, which is then verified by the large LLM. If correct, the answer
is adopted directly; otherwise, the large LLM performs in-depth reasoning.
Experimental results show that, for simple problems, our approach reduces the
computational cost of the large LLM by more than 50% with negligible accuracy
loss, while consistently maintaining robust performance on complex tasks.

Abstract: A fundamental limitation of current AI agents is their inability to learn
complex skills on the fly at test time, often behaving like "clever but
clueless interns" in novel environments. This severely limits their practical
utility. To systematically measure and drive progress on this challenge, we
first introduce the Jericho Test-Time Learning (J-TTL) benchmark. J-TTL is a
new evaluation setup where an agent must play the same game for several
consecutive episodes, attempting to improve its performance from one episode to
the next. On J-TTL, we find that existing adaptation methods like reflection,
memory, or reinforcement learning struggle. To address the challenges posed by
our benchmark, we present EvoTest, an evolutionary test-time learning framework
that improves an agent without any fine-tuning or gradients-by evolving the
entire agentic system after every episode. EvoTest has two roles: the Actor
Agent, which plays the game, and the Evolver Agent, which analyzes the episode
transcript to propose a revised configuration for the next run. This
configuration rewrites the prompt, updates memory by logging effective
state-action choices, tunes hyperparameters, and learns the tool-use routines.
On our J-TTL benchmark, EvoTest consistently increases performance,
outperforming not only reflection and memory-only baselines but also more
complex online fine-tuning methods. Notably, our method is the only one capable
of winning two games (Detective and Library), while all baselines fail to win
any.

Abstract: The driving environment perception has a vital role for autonomous driving
and nowadays has been actively explored for its realization. The research
community and relevant stakeholders necessitate the development of Deep
Learning (DL) models and AI-enabled solutions to enhance autonomous vehicles
(AVs) for smart mobility. There is a need to develop a model that accurately
perceives multiple objects on the road and predicts the driver's perception to
control the car's movements. This article proposes a novel utility-based
analytical model that enables perception systems of AVs to understand the
driving environment. The article consists of modules: acquiring a custom
dataset having distinctive objects, i.e., motorcyclists, rickshaws, etc; a
DL-based model (YOLOv8s) for object detection; and a module to measure the
utility of perception service from the performance values of trained model
instances. The perception model is validated based on the object detection
task, and its process is benchmarked by state-of-the-art deep learning models'
performance metrics from the nuScense dataset. The experimental results show
three best-performing YOLOv8s instances based on mAP@0.5 values, i.e.,
SGD-based (0.832), Adam-based (0.810), and AdamW-based (0.822). However, the
AdamW-based model (i.e., car: 0.921, motorcyclist: 0.899, truck: 0.793, etc.)
still outperforms the SGD-based model (i.e., car: 0.915, motorcyclist: 0.892,
truck: 0.781, etc.) because it has better class-level performance values,
confirmed by the proposed perception model. We validate that the proposed
function is capable of finding the right perception for AVs. The results above
encourage using the proposed perception model to evaluate the utility of
learning models and determine the appropriate perception for AVs.

Conclusion: SAJA框架成功实现了状态和动作攻击的协同效应，为多智能体深度强化学习的对抗鲁棒性研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) has shown potential for
cooperative and competitive tasks such as autonomous driving and strategic
gaming. However, models trained by MADRL are vulnerable to adversarial
perturbations on states and actions. Therefore, it is essential to investigate
the robustness of MADRL models from an attack perspective. Existing studies
focus on either state-only attacks or action-only attacks, but do not consider
how to effectively joint them. Simply combining state and action perturbations
such as randomly perturbing states and actions does not exploit their potential
synergistic effects. In this paper, we propose the State-Action Joint Attack
(SAJA) framework that has a good synergistic effects. SAJA consists of two
important phases: (1) In the state attack phase, a multi-step gradient ascent
method utilizes both the actor network and the critic network to compute an
adversarial state, and (2) in the action attack phase, based on the perturbed
state, a second gradient ascent uses the critic network to craft the final
adversarial action. Additionally, a heuristic regularizer measuring the
distance between the perturbed actions and the original clean ones is added
into the loss function to enhance the effectiveness of the critic's guidance.
We evaluate SAJA in the Multi-Agent Particle Environment (MPE), demonstrating
that (1) it outperforms and is more stealthy than state-only or action-only
attacks, and (2) existing state or action defense methods cannot defend its
attacks.

Abstract: Rationalization, a data-centric framework, aims to build self-explanatory
models to explain the prediction outcome by generating a subset of
human-intelligible pieces of the input data. It involves a cooperative game
model where a generator generates the most human-intelligible parts of the
input (i.e., rationales), followed by a predictor that makes predictions based
on these generated rationales. Conventional rationalization methods typically
impose constraints via regularization terms to calibrate or penalize undesired
generation. However, these methods are suffering from a problem called mode
collapse, in which the predictor produces correct predictions yet the generator
consistently outputs rationales with collapsed patterns. Moreover, existing
studies are typically designed separately for specific collapsed patterns,
lacking a unified consideration. In this paper, we systematically revisit
cooperative rationalization from a novel game-theoretic perspective and
identify the fundamental cause of this problem: the generator no longer tends
to explore new strategies to uncover informative rationales, ultimately leading
the system to converge to a suboptimal game equilibrium (correct predictions
v.s collapsed rationales). To solve this problem, we then propose a novel
approach, Game-theoretic Policy Optimization oriented RATionalization (PORAT),
which progressively introduces policy interventions to address the game
equilibrium in the cooperative game process, thereby guiding the model toward a
more optimal solution state. We theoretically analyse the cause of such a
suboptimal equilibrium and prove the feasibility of the proposed method.
Furthermore, we validate our method on nine widely used real-world datasets and
two synthetic settings, where PORAT achieves up to 8.1% performance
improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究评估了大型语言模型在因果链发现任务中的机制性因果推理能力，发现LLMs能生成逻辑连贯的因果链，但主要依赖关联模式匹配而非真正的因果推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大型语言模型如何理解因果关系中的中间因果步骤，以及它们是否具备机制性因果推理能力，特别是在论证情境中。

Method: 使用九个LLMs生成给定因果对之间的所有可能中间因果步骤，这些因果对来自气候变化辩论的论证研究资源，采用诊断性评估框架。

Result: LLMs生成的因果链在数量和粒度上存在差异，虽然逻辑连贯且模型对其自信，但主要基于关联模式匹配而非真正的因果推理。人类评估确认了生成链的逻辑一致性。

Conclusion: 该研究为推进论证情境中的隐式机制性因果推理工作奠定了坚实基础，包括基线方法、诊断评估见解和基准数据集。

Abstract: How does a cause lead to an effect, and which intermediate causal steps
explain their connection? This work scrutinizes the mechanistic causal
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to answer these
questions through the task of implicit causal chain discovery. In a diagnostic
evaluation framework, we instruct nine LLMs to generate all possible
intermediate causal steps linking given cause-effect pairs in causal chain
structures. These pairs are drawn from recent resources in argumentation
studies featuring polarized discussion on climate change. Our analysis reveals
that LLMs vary in the number and granularity of causal steps they produce.
Although they are generally self-consistent and confident about the
intermediate causal connections in the generated chains, their judgments are
mainly driven by associative pattern matching rather than genuine causal
reasoning. Nonetheless, human evaluations confirmed the logical coherence and
integrity of the generated chains. Our baseline causal chain discovery
approach, insights from our diagnostic evaluation, and benchmark dataset with
causal chains lay a solid foundation for advancing future work in implicit,
mechanistic causal reasoning in argumentation settings.

*He Du,Bowen Li,Chengxing Xie,Chang Gao,Kai Chen,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Confidence-as-a-Reward (CRew)方法，利用模型对最终答案的token级置信度作为奖励信号，无需训练即可在数学推理任务中超越现有无训练奖励方法，甚至优于大多数训练过的奖励模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有奖励模型需要大量标注数据和昂贵训练，而无训练方法如LLM-as-a-Judge虽有效但未系统研究置信度作为奖励的潜力。

Method: CRew方法使用模型对最终答案的token级置信度作为奖励代理，特别适用于封闭式任务。还提出CRew-DPO训练策略，结合置信度分数和正确性信号构建偏好数据。

Result: 在MATH500和RewardMATH基准测试中，CRew优于现有无训练奖励方法，甚至超过大多数训练过的奖励模型。CRew分数与模型实际推理性能强相关，并能有效筛选高质量训练数据。

Conclusion: 置信度作为奖励是简单而强大的方法，CRew-DPO进一步提升了模型的判断能力，持续优于现有自训练方法。

Abstract: Reward models can significantly enhance the reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs), but they typically require extensive curated data and
costly training. To mitigate these challenges, training-free approaches such as
LLM-as-a-Judge leverage the intrinsic reasoning abilities of LLMs to evaluate
responses, achieving promising results. Recent works have also indicated that
model confidence can serve effectively as a reward metric, distinguishing
between chain-of-thought (CoT) and non-CoT paths. However, the concept of using
confidence as a reward has not been comprehensively studied. In this work, we
systematically investigate Confidence-as-a-Reward (CRew), a simple yet powerful
training-free method that utilizes token-level confidence in the model's final
answers as a proxy for reward, especially suitable for close-ended tasks.
Through extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks, we demonstrate
that CRew outperforms existing training-free reward approaches on the MATH500
and RewardMATH benchmarks, and even surpasses most trained reward models. We
further identify a strong correlation between CRew scores and the actual
reasoning performance of the model. Additionally, we find that CRew can
effectively filter high-quality training data. Building upon these insights, we
propose CRew-DPO, a training strategy that constructs preference data from
confidence scores combined with correctness signals. Finetuning with CRew-DPO
further enhances the model's judging capabilities and consistently outperforms
existing self-training methods.

Motivation: 生成式AI在金融服务行业应用时面临性能评估困难，传统机器学习指标无法很好泛化到GenAI工作负载，且广泛使用的基准测试难以适应工业应用需求。

Method: 开发了一个风险评估框架，用于更好地应用领域专家评估和机器学习指标，解决选择特定指标时的各种独特风险。

Conclusion: 提出的风险评估框架能够帮助金融服务行业更有效地应用生成式AI，解决模型性能评估的挑战。

Abstract: As Generative Artificial Intelligence is adopted across the financial
services industry, a significant barrier to adoption and usage is measuring
model performance. Historical machine learning metrics can oftentimes fail to
generalize to GenAI workloads and are often supplemented using Subject Matter
Expert (SME) Evaluation. Even in this combination, many projects fail to
account for various unique risks present in choosing specific metrics.
Additionally, many widespread benchmarks created by foundational research labs
and educational institutions fail to generalize to industrial use. This paper
explains these challenges and provides a Risk Assessment Framework to allow for
better application of SME and machine learning Metrics

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出串联训练方法，通过随机切换强弱模型来增强语言模型解决方案的可理解性，确保强模型的推理过程能够被弱模型继续执行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语言模型快速发展，其推理过程可能变得难以被弱智能体或人类理解，这会损害可解释性和监督能力。需要开发方法使强模型产生的解决方案对弱协作伙伴保持可理解。

Method: 引入串联训练，这是一种强化学习范式，在训练过程中随机从冻结的弱模型而非正在训练的强模型中采样rollout tokens。只有当强模型的动作和推理过程能够被弱模型继续时，rollout才会成功。

Result: 在GSM8K数学推理任务中，串联训练可靠地教会模型放弃专业术语，使语言适应弱伙伴，同时保持高任务准确率。

Conclusion: 串联训练为构建可被弱智能体审计的AI系统提供了一条有前景的路径，对人与AI协作和多智能体通信具有重要意义。

Abstract: As language models continue to rapidly improve, we can expect their actions
and reasoning to become difficult or impossible for weaker agents and humans to
follow, undermining interpretability and oversight. With an eye on long-term
futures, we pursue methods that encourage models to produce solutions that
remain intelligible to weaker collaborators. We formalize intelligibility as
handoff robustness: a strong model's solution is intelligible to a weaker model
if randomly handing off control to the weaker model along the solution path
does not cause failure. Building on this criterion, we introduce tandem
training for language models, a reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm in which
rollout tokens are intermittently and randomly sampled from a frozen weak model
rather than the strong model being trained. Because rollouts succeed only when
the strong model's actions and reasoning process can be continued by the weak
model -- when the two can co-construct a successful solution -- optimizing
standard RL objectives with tandem training implicitly incentivizes both
correctness and intelligibility. In the GSM8K math reasoning task, tandem
training reliably teaches models to abandon jargon and adapt their language to
weaker partners while keeping task accuracy high. Our results demonstrate a
promising route to building AI systems that remain auditable by weaker agents,
with implications for human--AI collaboration and multi-agent communication.

Abstract: Logic-based models can be used to build verification tools for machine
learning classifiers employed in the legal field. ML classifiers predict the
outcomes of new cases based on previous ones, thereby performing a form of
case-based reasoning (CBR). In this paper, we introduce a modal logic of
classifiers designed to formally capture legal CBR. We incorporate principles
for resolving conflicts between precedents, by introducing into the logic the
temporal dimension of cases and the hierarchy of courts within the legal
system.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前辅助代理往往倾向于独立完成任务而非真正协助人类达成目标，且需要昂贵的人工反馈。需要一种自监督方法让AI更好地辅助人类。

Method: 基于最大化人类赋权（影响环境的能力）来调优辅助语言模型，仅使用离线文本数据进行自监督训练。

Result: 用户研究中参与者78%更偏好Empower助手，接受率提高31%，建议减少38%。在代码编程环境中，模拟程序员的成功率比基线提高192%。

Conclusion: Empower方法为大规模构建有用且对齐的AI代理提供了框架，仅需离线数据，无需额外人工反馈或可验证奖励。

Abstract: Assistive agents should not only take actions on behalf of a human, but also
step out of the way and cede control when there are important decisions to be
made. However, current methods for building assistive agents, whether via
mimicking expert humans or via RL finetuning on an inferred reward, often
encourage agents to complete tasks on their own rather than truly assisting the
human attain their objectives. Additionally, these methods often require costly
explicit human feedback to provide a training signal. We propose a new approach
to tuning assistive language models based on maximizing the human's
empowerment, their ability to effect desired changes in the environment. Our
empowerment-maximizing method, Empower, only requires offline text data,
providing a self-supervised method for fine-tuning language models to better
assist humans. To study the efficacy of our approach, we conducted an 18-person
user study comparing our empowerment assistant with a strong baseline.
Participants preferred our assistant 78% of the time (p=0.015), with a 31%
higher acceptance rate and 38% fewer suggestions. Additionally, we introduce a
new environment for evaluating multi-turn code assistance using simulated
humans. Using this environment, we show that agents trained with Empower
increase the success rate of a simulated human programmer on challenging coding
questions by an average of 192% over an SFT baseline. With this empowerment
objective, we provide a framework for useful aligned AI agents at scale using
only offline data without the need for any additional human feedback or
verifiable rewards.

Method: 通过安全关键控制理论的视角，在AI模型的世界潜在表示中构建预测性护栏，实时监控AI系统输出并主动修正风险输出为安全输出，采用模型无关的方式，并通过安全关键强化学习提供可扩展的训练方法。

Result: 在模拟驾驶和电子商务环境中的实验表明，控制理论护栏能够可靠地引导LLM代理避免灾难性结果（从碰撞到破产），同时保持任务性能。

Conclusion: 控制理论护栏为当前的标记-阻止式护栏提供了原则性的动态替代方案，能够更好地处理智能体AI系统中的安全挑战。

Abstract: Generative AI systems are increasingly assisting and acting on behalf of end
users in practical settings, from digital shopping assistants to
next-generation autonomous cars. In this context, safety is no longer about
blocking harmful content, but about preempting downstream hazards like
financial or physical harm. Yet, most AI guardrails continue to rely on output
classification based on labeled datasets and human-specified criteria,making
them brittle to new hazardous situations. Even when unsafe conditions are
flagged, this detection offers no path to recovery: typically, the AI system
simply refuses to act--which is not always a safe choice. In this work, we
argue that agentic AI safety is fundamentally a sequential decision problem:
harmful outcomes arise from the AI system's continually evolving interactions
and their downstream consequences on the world. We formalize this through the
lens of safety-critical control theory, but within the AI model's latent
representation of the world. This enables us to build predictive guardrails
that (i) monitor an AI system's outputs (actions) in real time and (ii)
proactively correct risky outputs to safe ones, all in a model-agnostic manner
so the same guardrail can be wrapped around any AI model. We also offer a
practical training recipe for computing such guardrails at scale via
safety-critical reinforcement learning. Our experiments in simulated driving
and e-commerce settings demonstrate that control-theoretic guardrails can
reliably steer LLM agents clear of catastrophic outcomes (from collisions to
bankruptcy) while preserving task performance, offering a principled dynamic
alternative to today's flag-and-block guardrails.

Method: 通过500多小时人工标注构建Hard2Verify基准，包含前沿LLM对近期挑战性数学问题的回答，要求验证器提供步骤级标注或识别第一个错误。

Result: 评估了29个生成式批评器和过程奖励模型，发现除少数优秀模型外，开源验证器性能落后于闭源模型。

Conclusion: 分析了步骤级验证性能差的原因、验证器计算规模的影响，以及自验证和验证-生成动态等基本问题。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based reasoning systems have recently achieved
gold medal-level performance in the IMO 2025 competition, writing mathematical
proofs where, to receive full credit, each step must be not only correct but
also sufficiently supported. To train LLM-based reasoners in such challenging,
open-ended settings, strong verifiers capable of catching step-level mistakes
are necessary prerequisites. We introduce Hard2Verify, a human-annotated,
step-level verification benchmark produced with over 500 hours of human labor.
Hard2Verify is designed to rigorously assess step-level verifiers at the
frontier: Verifiers must provide step-level annotations or identify the first
error in responses generated by frontier LLMs for very recent, challenging, and
open-ended math questions. We evaluate 29 generative critics and process reward
models, demonstrating that, beyond a few standouts, open-source verifiers lag
closed source models. We subsequently analyze what drives poor performance in
step-level verification, the impacts of scaling verifier compute, as well as
fundamental questions such as self-verification and verification-generation
dynamics.
