Existing theory can account for this pattern only under restrictive\nassumptions on returns, discounting, and preferences. This paper develops a\ngeneral theory of optimal savings with preference shocks, allowing risk\naversion to vary across states and over time. We show that incorporating such\nheterogeneity in risk attitudes fundamentally alters the asymptotic dynamics of\nconsumption and saving. In particular, we provide an analytical\ncharacterization of the asymptotic MPCs and show that zero asymptotic MPCs,\ncorresponding to a 100\\% asymptotic saving rate, arise under markedly weaker\nconditions than in existing theory. Strikingly, such outcomes occur whenever\nthere is a positive probability that agents become less risk averse in the\nfuture. As a result, the vanishing MPC emerges as a generic feature rather than\na knife-edge result of the optimal savings model, offering a more theoretically\nrobust and empirically consistent account of the saving behavior of wealthy\nhouseholds."}

Handling this complexity and ensuring\nconsistency throughout the development and validation processes requires a\nstructured, transparent, and verified description of the environment. However,\nexisting Operational Design Domain (ODD) concepts do not yet address the unique\nchallenges of agricultural applications.\n  Therefore, this work introduces the Agricultural ODD (Ag-ODD) Framework,\nwhich can be used to describe and verify the operational boundaries of\nautonomous agricultural systems. The Ag-ODD Framework consists of three core\nelements. First, the Ag-ODD description concept, which provides a structured\nmethod for unambiguously defining environmental and operational parameters\nusing concepts from ASAM Open ODD and CityGML. Second, the 7-Layer Model\nderived from the PEGASUS 6-Layer Model, has been extended to include a process\nlayer to capture dynamic agricultural operations. Third, the iterative\nverification process verifies the Ag-ODD against its corresponding logical\nscenarios, derived from the 7-Layer Model, to ensure the Ag-ODD's completeness\nand consistency.\n  Together, these elements provide a consistent approach for creating\nunambiguous and verifiable Ag-ODD.

Many\nestablished approaches (e.g., extrapolation and quasi-probability cancellation)\nimpose substantial execution or calibration overheads, while existing\nlearning-based methods have difficulty scaling to large and deep circuits. In\nthis research, we introduce QAGT-MLP: an attention-based graph transformer\ntailored for small- and large-scale quantum error mitigation (QEM). QAGT-MLP\nencodes each quantum circuit as a graph whose nodes represent gate instances\nand whose edges capture qubit connectivity and causal adjacency. A dual-path\nattention module extracts features around measured qubits at two scales or\ncontexts: 1) graph-wide global structural context; and 2) fine-grained local\nlightcone context. These learned representations are concatenated with\ncircuit-level descriptor features and the circuit noisy expected values, then\nthey are passed to a lightweight MLP to predict the noise-mitigated values. On\nlarge-scale 100-qubit Trotterized 1D Transverse-Field Ising Models -- TFIM\ncircuits -- the proposed QAGT-MLP outperformed state-of-the-art learning\nbaselines in terms of mean error and error variability, demonstrating strong\nvalidity and applicability in real-world QEM scenarios under matched shot\nbudgets.

Third, agents mitigate distinct failure modes--removing discovery or\nanalysis causes catastrophic failures (243-280 instances), while removing\nreport or intent causes quality degradation. Fourth, architectural benefits\npersist across task complexity with stable win rates (86-92% analysis, 84-94%\ndiscovery), indicating workflow management value rather than reasoning\nenhancement. Fifth, wide variance in agent effectiveness across models (42-96%\nfor analysis) requires model-aware architecture design. These principles guide\nwhen and why specialization is necessary for complex analytical workflows while\nenabling broader access to public data through natural language interfaces."}

To\naddress these challenges, we present an LLM-enhanced Air Monitoring Interface\n(AMI) that integrates real-time sensor data with a conversational interface via\nthe Model Context Protocol (MCP).

Expert evaluation demonstrated high factual\naccuracy (4.78), completeness (4.82), and minimal hallucinations (4.84), on a\nscale of 5, supported by inter-rater reliability analysis.

Ridge regularization limits the influence of high-leverage\nobservations, improving stability and precision in small samples. In large\nsamples, LOORA attains the asymptotic efficiency of regression-adjusted\nestimator as characterized by Lin (2013, Annals of Applied Statistics), while\nremaining exactly unbiased. To construct confidence intervals, we rely on\nasymptotic variance estimates that treat the estimator as a two-step procedure,\naccounting for both the regression adjustment and the random assignment stages.\nTwo within-subject experimental applications that provide realistic joint\ndistributions of potential outcomes as ground truth show that LOORA eliminates\nsubstantial biases and achieves close-to-nominal confidence interval coverage."}

A critical distinction in this\ncontext is between factual knowledge, which can be evaluated against true or\nfalse answers (e.g., \"what is the capital of England?\"), and probabilistic\nknowledge, reflecting probabilistic properties of the real world (e.g., \"what\nis the sex of a computer science graduate in the US?\"). In this paper, our goal\nis to build a benchmark for understanding the capabilities of LLMs in terms of\nknowledge of probability distributions describing the real world. Given that\nLLMs are trained on vast amounts of text, it may be plausible that they\ninternalize aspects of these distributions. Indeed, LLMs are touted as powerful\nuniversal approximators of real-world distributions. At the same time,\nclassical results in statistics, known as curse of dimensionality, highlight\nfundamental challenges in learning distributions in high dimensions,\nchallenging the notion of universal distributional learning. In this work, we\ndevelop the first benchmark to directly test this hypothesis, evaluating\nwhether LLMs have access to empirical distributions describing real-world\npopulations across domains such as economics, health, education, and social\nbehavior. Our results demonstrate that LLMs perform poorly overall, and do not\nseem to internalize real-world statistics naturally. When interpreted in the\ncontext of Pearl's Causal Hierarchy (PCH), our benchmark demonstrates that\nlanguage models do not contain knowledge on observational distributions (Layer\n1 of PCH), and thus the Causal Hierarchy Theorem implies that interventional\n(Layer 2) and counterfactual (Layer 3) knowledge of these models is also\nlimited."}

Our experimental results show that\nsemantic-enhancement enables even small locally-deployable FMs to successfully\nplan over indoor environments."}

Existing monitoring approaches,\ninherited from traditional machine learning (ML), are task-based and founded on\nassumed performance degradation arising from dataset drift. In contrast, with\nLLMs, inevitable model degradation due to changes in populations compared to\nthe training dataset cannot be assumed, because LLMs were not trained for any\nspecific task in any given population. We therefore propose a new organizing\nprinciple guiding generalist LLM monitoring that is scalable and grounded in\nhow these models are developed and used in practice: capability-based\nmonitoring. Capability-based monitoring is motivated by the fact that LLMs are\ngeneralist systems whose overlapping internal capabilities are reused across\nnumerous downstream tasks. Instead of evaluating each downstream task\nindependently, this approach organizes monitoring around shared model\ncapabilities, such as summarization, reasoning, translation, or safety\nguardrails, in order to enable cross-task detection of systemic weaknesses,\nlong-tail errors, and emergent behaviors that task-based monitoring may miss.\nWe describe considerations for developers, organizational leaders, and\nprofessional societies for implementing a capability-based monitoring approach.\nUltimately, capability-based monitoring will provide a scalable foundation for\nsafe, adaptive, and collaborative monitoring of LLMs and future generalist\nartificial intelligence models in healthcare."}

Coordinating robotic actions with human assistance remains\ndifficult due to the unpredictable dynamics of deformable materials and the\nneed for adaptive force control. To explore this challenge, we focus on the\ntask of gift wrapping, which exemplifies a long-horizon manipulation problem\ninvolving precise folding, controlled creasing, and secure fixation of paper.\nSuccess is achieved when the robot completes the sequence to produce a neatly\nwrapped package with clean folds and no tears.\n  We propose a learning-based framework that integrates a high-level task\nplanner powered by a large language model (LLM) with a low-level hybrid\nimitation learning (IL) and reinforcement learning (RL) policy. At its core is\na Sub-task Aware Robotic Transformer (START) that learns a unified policy from\nhuman demonstrations. The key novelty lies in capturing long-range temporal\ndependencies across the full wrapping sequence within a single model. Unlike\nvanilla Action Chunking with Transformer (ACT), typically applied to short\ntasks, our method introduces sub-task IDs that provide explicit temporal\ngrounding. This enables robust performance across the entire wrapping process\nand supports flexible execution, as the policy learns sub-goals rather than\nmerely replicating motion sequences.\n  Our framework achieves a 97% success rate on real-world wrapping tasks.

In recent years, the\nrapid development of large language models (LLM) has led to substantial\nimprovements in their language understanding and code generation capabilities.\nConsequently, the design of optimization algorithms leveraging large language\nmodels has garnered increasing attention from researchers.

Since comprehensive\nconventional physical testing is impractical due to cost and safety concerns,\nVirtual Testing Environments (VTE) can be adopted as an alternative. Comparing\nVTE-generated sensor outputs against their real-world analogues can be a strong\nindication that the VTE accurately represents reality. Correspondingly, this\nwork explores a comprehensive experimental approach to finding evaluation\nmetrics suitable for comparing real-world and simulated LiDAR scans. The\nmetrics were tested in terms of sensitivity and accuracy with different noise,\ndensity, distortion, sensor orientation, and channel settings. From comparing\nthe metrics, we found that Density Aware Chamfer Distance (DCD) works best\nacross all cases. In the second step of the research, a Virtual Testing\nEnvironment was generated using real LiDAR scan data. The data was collected in\na controlled environment with only static objects using an instrumented vehicle\nequipped with LiDAR, IMU and cameras. Simulated LiDAR scans were generated from\nthe VTEs using the same pose as real LiDAR scans. The simulated and LiDAR scans\nwere compared in terms of model perception and geometric similarity. Actual and\nsimulated LiDAR scans have a similar semantic segmentation output with a mIoU\nof 21\\% with corrected intensity and an average density aware chamfer distance\n(DCD) of 0.63. This indicates a slight difference in the geometric properties\nof simulated and real LiDAR scans and a significant difference between model\noutputs. During the comparison, density-aware chamfer distance was found to be\nthe most correlated among the metrics with perception methods."}

To address this gap, we introduce GUIDES, a\nlightweight framework that augments pre-trained policies with semantic guidance\nfrom foundation models without requiring architectural redesign. GUIDES employs\na fine-tuned vision-language model (Instructor) to generate contextual\ninstructions, which are encoded by an auxiliary module into guidance\nembeddings.

We demonstrate that the stable range of the shape\nfactor is [0.5, 1] through domain mapping. Depending on the operating\nfrequencies and the shape factor, we observe two distinct distortion modes,\ni.e., the magnitude and phase distortion. We proceed to develop an optimal\ndesign method for the shape factor based on an objective function in form of\nthe normalized magnitude or phase error. Finally, a low-pass filter (LPF) is\ndesigned and tested to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method by\ncomparing the theoretical calculations with the experimental results."}

These studies have explored the advantages\nand opportunities of the proposed configuration from the perspectives of\ncapacity sharing and frequency support. However, the potential challenges of\nsmall-signal stability arising from this interconnection have not been\nthoroughly examined. To address this gap, detailed model-based simulation\nstudies are performed in this paper to assess the risks of poorly damped\ninter-area oscillations in the proposed macrogrid. A custom-built dynamic model\nof the MTDC system is developed and integrated with industry-grade models of\nthe EI and WI, incorporating high levels of inverter-based energy resources.\nThrough model-based oscillation analysis, potential shifts in inter-area modes\nfor both EI and WI, resulting from the MTDC integration are characterized, and\nmodes with inadequate damping are identified. Furthermore, to mitigate the\nrisks of unstable oscillations, supplementary damping controllers are designed\nfor the MTDC system, leveraging wide-area feedback to modulate active power set\npoints at selected converter stations. A frequency scanning approach is\nemployed for data-driven model linearization and controller synthesis.

This paper\nintroduces an MCP server for analyzing ROS and ROS 2 bags, allowing for\nanalyzing, visualizing and processing robot data with natural language through\nLLMs and VLMs. We describe specific tooling built with robotics domain\nknowledge, with our initial release focused on mobile robotics and supporting\nnatively the analysis of trajectories, laser scan data, transforms, or time\nseries data. This is in addition to providing an interface to standard ROS 2\nCLI tools (\"ros2 bag list\" or \"ros2 bag info\"), as well as the ability to\nfilter bags with a subset of topics or trimmed in time. Coupled with the MCP\nserver, we provide a lightweight UI that allows the benchmarking of the tooling\nwith different LLMs, both proprietary (Anthropic, OpenAI) and open-source\n(through Groq). Our experimental results include the analysis of tool calling\ncapabilities of eight different state-of-the-art LLM/VLM models, both\nproprietary and open-source, large and small.

We investigated whether and how Large Language Models (LLMs)\ncan model the correlational structure of human psychological traits from\nminimal quantitative inputs. We prompted various LLMs with Big Five Personality\nScale responses from 816 human individuals to role-play their responses on nine\nother psychological scales. LLMs demonstrated remarkable accuracy in capturing\nhuman psychological structure, with the inter-scale correlation patterns from\nLLM-generated responses strongly aligning with those from human data $(R^2 >\n0.89)$. This zero-shot performance substantially exceeded predictions based on\nsemantic similarity and approached the accuracy of machine learning algorithms\ntrained directly on the dataset. Analysis of reasoning traces revealed that\nLLMs use a systematic two-stage process: First, they transform raw Big Five\nresponses into natural language personality summaries through information\nselection and compression, analogous to generating sufficient statistics.\nSecond, they generate target scale responses based on reasoning from these\nsummaries. For information selection, LLMs identify the same key personality\nfactors as trained algorithms, though they fail to differentiate item\nimportance within factors. The resulting compressed summaries are not merely\nredundant representations but capture synergistic information--adding them to\noriginal scores enhances prediction alignment, suggesting they encode emergent,\nsecond-order patterns of trait interplay. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs\ncan precisely predict individual participants' psychological traits from\nminimal data through a process of abstraction and reasoning, offering both a\npowerful tool for psychological simulation and valuable insights into their\nemergent reasoning capabilities."}

Large language models show promise for\nindividual tasks, but end-to-end analytical workflows expose fundamental\nlimitations: attention dilutes across growing contexts, specialized reasoning\npatterns interfere, and errors propagate undetected. We present PublicAgent, a\nmulti-agent framework that addresses these limitations through decomposition\ninto specialized agents for intent clarification, dataset discovery, analysis,\nand reporting. This architecture maintains focused attention within agent\ncontexts and enables validation at each stage. Evaluation across five models\nand 50 queries derives five design principles for multi-agent LLM systems.\nFirst, specialization provides value independent of model strength--even the\nstrongest model shows 97.5% agent win rates, with benefits orthogonal to model\nscale. Second, agents divide into universal (discovery, analysis) and\nconditional (report, intent) categories. Universal agents show consistent\neffectiveness (std dev 12.4%) while conditional agents vary by model (std dev\n20.5%). Third, agents mitigate distinct failure modes--removing discovery or\nanalysis causes catastrophic failures (243-280 instances), while removing\nreport or intent causes quality degradation. Fourth, architectural benefits\npersist across task complexity with stable win rates (86-92% analysis, 84-94%\ndiscovery), indicating workflow management value rather than reasoning\nenhancement. Fifth, wide variance in agent effectiveness across models (42-96%\nfor analysis) requires model-aware architecture design.

Many real-world scenarios require robots to\nnavigate dynamic environments while adhering to manifold constraints imposed by\ntasks.

Despite recent advances in\ndecentralized MAMP for high-dimensional systems, incorporating manifold\nconstraints remains difficult. To address this, we propose a\nmanifold-constrained Hamilton-Jacobi reachability (HJR) learning framework for\ndecentralized MAMP. Our method solves HJR problems under manifold constraints\nto capture task-aware safety conditions, which are then integrated into a\ndecentralized trajectory optimization planner. This enables robots to generate\nmotion plans that are both safe and task-feasible without requiring assumptions\nabout other agents' policies. Our approach generalizes across diverse\nmanifold-constrained tasks and scales effectively to high-dimensional\nmulti-agent manipulation problems.

A critical distinction in this\ncontext is between factual knowledge, which can be evaluated against true or\nfalse answers (e.g., \"what is the capital of England?\"), and probabilistic\nknowledge, reflecting probabilistic properties of the real world (e.g., \"what\nis the sex of a computer science graduate in the US?\"). In this paper, our goal\nis to build a benchmark for understanding the capabilities of LLMs in terms of\nknowledge of probability distributions describing the real world. Given that\nLLMs are trained on vast amounts of text, it may be plausible that they\ninternalize aspects of these distributions. Indeed, LLMs are touted as powerful\nuniversal approximators of real-world distributions. At the same time,\nclassical results in statistics, known as curse of dimensionality, highlight\nfundamental challenges in learning distributions in high dimensions,\nchallenging the notion of universal distributional learning. In this work, we\ndevelop the first benchmark to directly test this hypothesis, evaluating\nwhether LLMs have access to empirical distributions describing real-world\npopulations across domains such as economics, health, education, and social\nbehavior. Our results demonstrate that LLMs perform poorly overall, and do not\nseem to internalize real-world statistics naturally. When interpreted in the\ncontext of Pearl's Causal Hierarchy (PCH), our benchmark demonstrates that\nlanguage models do not contain knowledge on observational distributions (Layer\n1 of PCH), and thus the Causal Hierarchy Theorem implies that interventional\n(Layer 2) and counterfactual (Layer 3) knowledge of these models is also\nlimited."}

In\nthis research, we introduce QAGT-MLP: an attention-based graph transformer\ntailored for small- and large-scale quantum error mitigation (QEM). QAGT-MLP\nencodes each quantum circuit as a graph whose nodes represent gate instances\nand whose edges capture qubit connectivity and causal adjacency. A dual-path\nattention module extracts features around measured qubits at two scales or\ncontexts: 1) graph-wide global structural context; and 2) fine-grained local\nlightcone context.

Coordinating robotic actions with human assistance remains\ndifficult due to the unpredictable dynamics of deformable materials and the\nneed for adaptive force control. To explore this challenge, we focus on the\ntask of gift wrapping, which exemplifies a long-horizon manipulation problem\ninvolving precise folding, controlled creasing, and secure fixation of paper.\nSuccess is achieved when the robot completes the sequence to produce a neatly\nwrapped package with clean folds and no tears.\n  We propose a learning-based framework that integrates a high-level task\nplanner powered by a large language model (LLM) with a low-level hybrid\nimitation learning (IL) and reinforcement learning (RL) policy. At its core is\na Sub-task Aware Robotic Transformer (START) that learns a unified policy from\nhuman demonstrations. The key novelty lies in capturing long-range temporal\ndependencies across the full wrapping sequence within a single model. Unlike\nvanilla Action Chunking with Transformer (ACT), typically applied to short\ntasks, our method introduces sub-task IDs that provide explicit temporal\ngrounding. This enables robust performance across the entire wrapping process\nand supports flexible execution, as the policy learns sub-goals rather than\nmerely replicating motion sequences.\n  Our framework achieves a 97% success rate on real-world wrapping tasks. We\nshow that the unified transformer-based policy reduces the need for specialized\nmodels, allows controlled human supervision, and effectively bridges high-level\nintent with the fine-grained force control required for deformable object\nmanipulation."}

In this paper, we present Solly, the first AI agent to\nachieve elite human play in reduced-format Liar's Poker, a game characterized\nby extensive multi-player engagement. We trained Solly using self-play with a\nmodel-free, actor-critic, deep reinforcement learning algorithm. Solly played\nat an elite human level as measured by win rate (won over 50% of hands) and\nequity (money won) in heads-up and multi-player Liar's Poker. Solly also\noutperformed large language models (LLMs), including those with reasoning\nabilities, on the same metrics. Solly developed novel bidding strategies,\nrandomized play effectively, and was not easily exploitable by world-class\nhuman players."}

To address these issues,\nwe modified the exponential function to obtain a novel headway distribution.\nRather than employing Euler's number (e) as the base of the exponential\nfunction, we utilized a real number base to provide greater flexibility in\nmodeling the observed headway. However, the proposed is not a probability\nfunction. We normalize it to calculate the probability and derive the\nclosed-form equation. In this study, we utilized a comprehensive experiment\nwith five open datasets: highD, exiD, NGSIM, Waymo, and Lyft to evaluate the\nperformance of the proposed distribution and compared its performance with six\nexisting distributions under mixed and heterogeneous traffic flow. The results\nrevealed that the proposed distribution not only captures the fundamental\ncharacteristics of headway distribution but also provides physically meaningful\nparameters that describe the distribution shape of observed headways. Under\nheterogeneous flow on highways (i.e., uninterrupted traffic flow), the proposed\ndistribution outperforms other candidate distributions. Under urban road\nconditions (i.e., interrupted traffic flow), including heterogeneous and mixed\ntraffic, the proposed distribution still achieves decent results."}
