### [1] [NEURODNAAI: Neural pipeline approaches for the advancing dna-based information storage as a sustainable digital medium using deep learning framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02417)
*Rakesh Thakur,Lavanya Singh,Yashika,Manomay Bundawala,Aruna Kumar*

Main category: cs.ET

TL;DR: NeuroDNAAI是一个基于深度学习的DNA存储框架，通过整合量子并行概念和生物约束来增强编码多样性和错误恢复能力，在噪声信道中实现高保真数据重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DNA作为数字信息存储介质具有高密度和耐久性优势，但合成成本、测序错误和生物约束（如GC含量不平衡、同聚物）限制了实际部署。

Method: 提出NeuroDNAAI框架，从量子并行概念中汲取灵感增强编码多样性，整合生物约束与深度学习来改进DNA存储中的错误缓解，将二进制数据流编码为符号DNA序列，通过包含替换、插入和删除的噪声信道传输并重建。

Result: 实验显示传统提示或基于规则的方案无法有效适应真实噪声，而NeuroDNAAI在基准数据集上对文本和图像都实现了低比特错误率。

Conclusion: 通过将理论、工作流和仿真统一到一个管道中，NeuroDNAAI实现了可扩展且生物学有效的档案DNA存储。

Abstract: DNA is a promising medium for digital information storage for its exceptional
density and durability. While prior studies advanced coding theory, workflow
design, and simulation tools, challenges such as synthesis costs, sequencing
errors, and biological constraints (GC-content imbalance, homopolymers) limit
practical deployment. To address this, our framework draws from quantum
parallelism concepts to enhance encoding diversity and resilience, integrating
biologically informed constraints with deep learning to enhance error
mitigation in DNA storage. NeuroDNAAI encodes binary data streams into symbolic
DNA sequences, transmits them through a noisy channel with substitutions,
insertions, and deletions, and reconstructs them with high fidelity. Our
results show that traditional prompting or rule-based schemes fail to adapt
effectively to realistic noise, whereas NeuroDNAAI achieves superior accuracy.
Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate low bit error rates for both text
and images. By unifying theory, workflow, and simulation into one pipeline,
NeuroDNAAI enables scalable, biologically valid archival DNA storage

### [2] [Algorithmic Tradeoff Exploration for Component Placement and Wire Routing in Nanomodular Electronics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03126)
*Peidi Song,Alexandros Daglis,Michael Filler,Ahmed Saeed*

Main category: cs.ET

TL;DR: 该论文研究了微模块化和纳米模块化电子(ME/NE)的设计自动化挑战，开发了可调节的布局布线算法，在制造时间和电路性能之间提供动态权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微模块化和纳米模块化电子技术提供了比传统单片方法更高的灵活性、可扩展性和可访问性，但由于沉积不精确导致每个电路实例都有独特布局，需要高效的自动化设计算法。

Method: 调整标准的分区、布局规划、布局和布线算法以适应ME/NE的独特特性，开发可调节的算法来探索制造时间与总导线长度之间的权衡。

Result: 评估显示在不同维度上存在显著优化空间，可调节算法可在总导线长度增加21%的情况下实现端到端制造时间108倍的改进，反之也可优先考虑电路质量/性能。

Conclusion: ME/NE在制造时间与电路性能之间引入了重要权衡，动态导航这一权衡空间的能力具有重要价值，可根据主要优化指标灵活调整算法策略。

Abstract: Advances in fabrication technology have enabled modularizing electronic
components at the micro- or nano-scale and composing these modules on demand
into larger circuits. Micromodular and nanomodular electronics (ME and NE) open
a new design space in electronics, promising a degree of flexibility,
extensibility, and accessibility far superior to traditional monolithic
methods. ME/NE leverage a multi-stage process of initial imprecise component
deposition, followed by precise wire printing to compose them into a circuit.
Due to imperfections in deposition, each circuit instance has a unique layout
with its own component placement and wire routing solutions, putting the design
automation process on the critical path. Moreover, high-performance nanomodular
components enable the synthesis of larger heterogeneous circuits than
traditional printed electronics, requiring more scalable algorithms. ME/NE thus
introduce a tradeoff between the time-to-solution for placement/routing
algorithms and the resulting total wire length, with the latter dictating
circuit printing time. We explore this tradeoff by adapting standard
partitioning, floorplanning, placement, and routing algorithms to the unique
characteristics of ME/NE. Our evaluations demonstrate significant optimization
headroom in different dimensions. For example, our tunable algorithms can
deliver a $108\times$ improvement in end-to-end manufacturing time at the cost
of $21\%$ increase in total wire length. Conversely, circuit
quality/performance can be prioritized at the cost of increased manufacturing
time, highlighting the value of the ability to dynamically navigate the
tradeoff space according to the primary optimization metric.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的机器人运动规划通常使用2D屏幕和鼠标键盘交互，缺乏空间理解和自然交互能力，限制了规划效率和用户体验。

Method: 开发了基于扩展现实的交互系统，集成MoveIt规划框架，提供沉浸式3D环境、自然交互方式（抓取和调整物体）、虚拟机器人交互以及多种交互模态。

Result: 用户可以在虚拟空间中可视化机器人运动，确保期望行为并避免碰撞，然后将规划好的路径部署到真实世界的物理机器人上。

Conclusion: ERUPT系统通过XR技术显著提升了机器人运动规划的空间理解能力和交互自然性，为安全高效的机器人路径规划提供了创新解决方案。

Abstract: We propose the Extended Reality Universal Planning Toolkit (ERUPT), an
extended reality (XR) system for interactive motion planning. Our system allows
users to create and dynamically reconfigure environments while they plan robot
paths. In immersive three-dimensional XR environments, users gain a greater
spatial understanding. XR also unlocks a broader range of natural interaction
capabilities, allowing users to grab and adjust objects in the environment
similarly to the real world, rather than using a mouse and keyboard with the
scene projected onto a two-dimensional computer screen. Our system integrates
with MoveIt, a manipulation planning framework, allowing users to send motion
planning requests and visualize the resulting robot paths in virtual or
augmented reality. We provide a broad range of interaction modalities, allowing
users to modify objects in the environment and interact with a virtual robot.
Our system allows operators to visualize robot motions, ensuring desired
behavior as it moves throughout the environment, without risk of collisions
within a virtual space, and to then deploy planned paths on physical robots in
the real world.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SIMSplat是一个基于语言对齐高斯泼溅的预测性驾驶场景编辑器，支持自然语言提示的直观操作和详细的对象级编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的驾驶场景编辑框架由于编辑能力有限，难以高效生成逼真场景，需要一种更直观和灵活的编辑方法。

Method: 通过语言对齐高斯重建场景，支持自然语言提示的直接查询和编辑，结合多智能体运动预测进行预测性路径优化。

Result: 在Waymo数据集上的实验表明，SIMSplat具有广泛的编辑能力和跨场景的适应性。

Conclusion: SIMSplat提供了一个高效且直观的驾驶场景编辑解决方案，能够生成具有真实交互的逼真场景。

Abstract: Driving scene manipulation with sensor data is emerging as a promising
alternative to traditional virtual driving simulators. However, existing
frameworks struggle to generate realistic scenarios efficiently due to limited
editing capabilities. To address these challenges, we present SIMSplat, a
predictive driving scene editor with language-aligned Gaussian splatting. As a
language-controlled editor, SIMSplat enables intuitive manipulation using
natural language prompts. By aligning language with Gaussian-reconstructed
scenes, it further supports direct querying of road objects, allowing precise
and flexible editing. Our method provides detailed object-level editing,
including adding new objects and modifying the trajectories of both vehicles
and pedestrians, while also incorporating predictive path refinement through
multi-agent motion prediction to generate realistic interactions among all
agents in the scene. Experiments on the Waymo dataset demonstrate SIMSplat's
extensive editing capabilities and adaptability across a wide range of
scenarios. Project page: https://sungyeonparkk.github.io/simsplat/

### [5] [U-LAG: Uncertainty-Aware, Lag-Adaptive Goal Retargeting for Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02526)
*Anamika J H,Anujith Muraleedharan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: U-LAG是一个中执行目标重定向层，能够在感知延迟、噪声或陈旧的情况下重新调整任务目标，而不改变底层控制器。核心贡献是UAR-PF不确定性感知重定向器，在感知延迟下维护物体姿态分布并选择最大化预期进展的目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人在变化环境中操作时，必须处理延迟、噪声或陈旧的感知数据，这会影响任务执行的准确性和成功率。

Method: 提出U-LAG框架，包含UAR-PF不确定性感知重定向器，在感知延迟下维护物体姿态分布，通过选择最大化预期进展的目标来重新调整任务目标。采用可插拔的重定向接口设计。

Result: 在PyBullet/PandaGym的Shift x Lag压力测试中，UAR-PF和ICP方法在0-10cm位移和0-400ms延迟下表现优于无重定向基线，获得更高成功率、更少的末端执行器移动和更少的中断。

Conclusion: U-LAG提供了一个有效的目标重定向解决方案，能够优雅地处理感知延迟和物体位移，提高机器人在动态环境中的操作性能。

Abstract: Robots manipulating in changing environments must act on percepts that are
late, noisy, or stale. We present U-LAG, a mid-execution goal-retargeting layer
that leaves the low-level controller unchanged while re-aiming task goals
(pre-contact, contact, post) as new observations arrive. Unlike motion
retargeting or generic visual servoing, U-LAG treats in-flight goal re-aiming
as a first-class, pluggable module between perception and control. Our main
technical contribution is UAR-PF, an uncertainty-aware retargeter that
maintains a distribution over object pose under sensing lag and selects goals
that maximize expected progress. We instantiate a reproducible Shift x Lag
stress test in PyBullet/PandaGym for pick, push, stacking, and peg insertion,
where the object undergoes abrupt in-plane shifts while synthetic perception
lag is injected during approach. Across 0-10 cm shifts and 0-400 ms lags,
UAR-PF and ICP degrade gracefully relative to a no-retarget baseline, achieving
higher success with modest end-effector travel and fewer aborts; simple
operational safeguards further improve stability. Contributions: (1) UAR-PF for
lag-adaptive, uncertainty-aware goal retargeting; (2) a pluggable retargeting
interface; and (3) a reproducible Shift x Lag benchmark with evaluation on
pick, push, stacking, and peg insertion.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有离线模仿学习方法在真实世界专家数据有限时面临的数据覆盖不足和性能严重下降问题。

Method: 基于世界模型的sim-to-real框架，结合在线模仿预训练和离线微调，利用在线交互缓解离线方法的数据覆盖限制。

Conclusion: 该框架通过在线交互有效缓解了数据覆盖限制，提高了鲁棒性并减少了微调过程中的性能下降，同时增强了领域迁移的泛化能力。

Abstract: We are interested in solving the problem of imitation learning with a limited
amount of real-world expert data. Existing offline imitation methods often
struggle with poor data coverage and severe performance degradation. We propose
a solution that leverages robot simulators to achieve online imitation
learning. Our sim-to-real framework is based on world models and combines
online imitation pretraining with offline finetuning. By leveraging online
interactions, our approach alleviates the data coverage limitations of offline
methods, leading to improved robustness and reduced performance degradation
during finetuning. It also enhances generalization during domain transfer. Our
empirical results demonstrate its effectiveness, improving success rates by at
least 31.7% in sim-to-sim transfer and 23.3% in sim-to-real transfer over
existing offline imitation learning baselines.

### [7] [Efficient Optimal Path Planning in Dynamic Environments Using Koopman MPC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02584)
*Mohammad Abtahi,Navid Mojahed,Shima Nazari*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Koopman算子的数据驱动模型预测控制框架，用于移动机器人在动态环境中的导航，通过双线性Koopman模型实现非线性最优控制问题的高效线性化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Koopman方法仅关注系统动力学的线性化，而本文旨在为包含非线性机器人动力学和避障约束的最优路径规划问题寻找全局线性表示，以提高计算效率。

Method: 使用扩展动态模式分解从输入状态数据中识别线性和双线性Koopman实现，在提升空间中构建路径规划的二次规划问题，并在MPC框架中确定最优机器人动作。

Result: 开环分析表明只有双线性Koopman模型能准确捕捉非线性状态-输入耦合和避障所需的二次项，线性实现无法做到。该方法比在原始状态空间求解的非线性MPC快320倍。

Conclusion: 双线性Koopman实现对于具有非线性状态和输入约束的高度非线性最优控制问题的线性化具有巨大潜力，能够实现类似线性问题的计算效率。

Abstract: This paper presents a data-driven model predictive control framework for
mobile robots navigating in dynamic environments, leveraging Koopman operator
theory. Unlike the conventional Koopman-based approaches that focus on the
linearization of system dynamics only, our work focuses on finding a global
linear representation for the optimal path planning problem that includes both
the nonlinear robot dynamics and collision-avoidance constraints. We deploy
extended dynamic mode decomposition to identify linear and bilinear Koopman
realizations from input-state data. Our open-loop analysis demonstrates that
only the bilinear Koopman model can accurately capture nonlinear state-input
couplings and quadratic terms essential for collision avoidance, whereas linear
realizations fail to do so. We formulate a quadratic program for the robot path
planning in the presence of moving obstacles in the lifted space and determine
the optimal robot action in an MPC framework. Our approach is capable of
finding the safe optimal action 320 times faster than a nonlinear MPC
counterpart that solves the path planning problem in the original state space.
Our work highlights the potential of bilinear Koopman realizations for
linearization of highly nonlinear optimal control problems subject to nonlinear
state and input constraints to achieve computational efficiency similar to
linear problems.

*Ruo Chen,David Blow,Adnan Abdullah,Md Jahidul Islam*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SubSense是一个结合触觉反馈和VR控制的框架，用于增强水下ROV的远程操作，通过非侵入式触觉接口和VR平台提升操作员的态势感知和任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ROV远程操作依赖低分辨率2D摄像头，缺乏沉浸感和感官反馈，在复杂海底环境中降低了态势感知能力。

Method: 提出SubSense框架，将非侵入式触觉反馈接口集成到1-DOF机械臂，与操作员手套配对提供触觉反馈和抓握状态，并开发端到端软件管理控制输入和通过VR平台显示沉浸式摄像头视图。

Result: 通过综合实验和用户研究验证了系统有效性，相比传统远程操作界面，在精细操作任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: 多感官反馈在沉浸式虚拟环境中具有显著提升远程态势感知和任务性能的潜力，为现场ROV操作提供更直观和易用的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper investigates the integration of haptic feedback and virtual
reality (VR) control interfaces to enhance teleoperation and telemanipulation
of underwater ROVs (remotely operated vehicles). Traditional ROV teleoperation
relies on low-resolution 2D camera feeds and lacks immersive and sensory
feedback, which diminishes situational awareness in complex subsea
environments. We propose SubSense -- a novel VR-Haptic framework incorporating
a non-invasive feedback interface to an otherwise 1-DOF (degree of freedom)
manipulator, which is paired with the teleoperator's glove to provide haptic
feedback and grasp status. Additionally, our framework integrates end-to-end
software for managing control inputs and displaying immersive camera views
through a VR platform. We validate the system through comprehensive experiments
and user studies, demonstrating its effectiveness over conventional
teleoperation interfaces, particularly for delicate manipulation tasks. Our
results highlight the potential of multisensory feedback in immersive virtual
environments to significantly improve remote situational awareness and mission
performance, offering more intuitive and accessible ROV operations in the
field.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: UMI-on-Air是一个用于具身感知部署具身无关操作策略的框架，通过结合高级UMI策略和低级具身特定控制器，在推理时实现动态可行的轨迹适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决将无约束人类演示训练的通用视觉运动策略转移到受约束机器人具身（如空中机械臂）时的控制和不匹配问题，避免分布外行为和执行失败。

Method: 提出具身感知扩散策略（EADP），在扩散采样过程中集成来自控制器跟踪成本的梯度反馈，引导轨迹生成朝向适合部署具身的动态可行模式。

Result: 在多个长视野和高精度空中操作任务上验证，相比无引导扩散基线，显示出更高的成功率、效率和抗干扰鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法为在不同具身（包括高度受约束的具身）上扩展通用操作技能提供了实用途径，使用在野外收集的UMI演示实现了部署。

Abstract: We introduce UMI-on-Air, a framework for embodiment-aware deployment of
embodiment-agnostic manipulation policies. Our approach leverages diverse,
unconstrained human demonstrations collected with a handheld gripper (UMI) to
train generalizable visuomotor policies. A central challenge in transferring
these policies to constrained robotic embodiments-such as aerial
manipulators-is the mismatch in control and robot dynamics, which often leads
to out-of-distribution behaviors and poor execution. To address this, we
propose Embodiment-Aware Diffusion Policy (EADP), which couples a high-level
UMI policy with a low-level embodiment-specific controller at inference time.
By integrating gradient feedback from the controller's tracking cost into the
diffusion sampling process, our method steers trajectory generation towards
dynamically feasible modes tailored to the deployment embodiment. This enables
plug-and-play, embodiment-aware trajectory adaptation at test time. We validate
our approach on multiple long-horizon and high-precision aerial manipulation
tasks, showing improved success rates, efficiency, and robustness under
disturbances compared to unguided diffusion baselines. Finally, we demonstrate
deployment in previously unseen environments, using UMI demonstrations
collected in the wild, highlighting a practical pathway for scaling
generalizable manipulation skills across diverse-and even highly
constrained-embodiments. All code, data, and checkpoints will be publicly
released after acceptance. Result videos can be found at umi-on-air.github.io.

*Mobin Habibpour,Alireza Nemati,Ali Meghdari,Alireza Taheri,Shima Nazari*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对动态环境的实时语义RGBD SLAM方法，通过深度学习语义信息检测移动物体并维护静态地图，在TUM数据集上实现了与最先进方法相当的定位精度，同时保持接近实时的运行速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉SLAM方法大多基于静态世界假设，在动态环境中表现不佳。本研究旨在开发专门针对动态环境的SLAM系统，解决移动物体对定位和建图的影响。

Method: 将深度学习语义信息集成到SLAM系统中，使用扩展卡尔曼滤波器识别暂时静止的动态物体，并采用生成网络填补动态物体区域的缺失信息。系统基于ROS平台实现高度模块化架构。

Result: 在GTX1080上达到约22fps的运行速度，在TUM动态序列上的定位误差与最先进方法相当，同时保持接近实时的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法成功地将语义信息融入SLAM系统，有效减轻了动态物体的影响，在动态环境中实现了鲁棒的相机跟踪和静态地图维护。

Abstract: Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) plays an important role in many
robotics fields, including social robots. Many of the available visual SLAM
methods are based on the assumption of a static world and struggle in dynamic
environments. In the current study, we introduce a real-time semantic RGBD SLAM
approach designed specifically for dynamic environments. Our proposed system
can effectively detect moving objects and maintain a static map to ensure
robust camera tracking. The key innovation of our approach is the incorporation
of deep learning-based semantic information into SLAM systems to mitigate the
impact of dynamic objects. Additionally, we enhance the semantic segmentation
process by integrating an Extended Kalman filter to identify dynamic objects
that may be temporarily idle. We have also implemented a generative network to
fill in the missing regions of input images belonging to dynamic objects. This
highly modular framework has been implemented on the ROS platform and can
achieve around 22 fps on a GTX1080. Benchmarking the developed pipeline on
dynamic sequences from the TUM dataset suggests that the proposed approach
delivers competitive localization error in comparison with the state-of-the-art
methods, all while operating in near real-time. The source code is publicly
available.

Result: 算法能够在不了解系统动力学的情况下，成功跟踪由可证明可达状态点组成的分段线性轨迹

Conclusion: 该方法为未知动力学系统的鲁棒控制提供了一种有效解决方案，特别适用于动力学可能突变的故障场景

Abstract: This paper proposes an algorithm capable of driving a system to follow a
piecewise linear trajectory without prior knowledge of the system dynamics.
Motivated by a critical failure scenario in which a system can experience an
abrupt change in its dynamics, we demonstrate that it is possible to follow a
set of waypoints comprised of states analytically proven to be reachable
despite not knowing the system dynamics. The proposed algorithm first applies
small perturbations to locally learn the system dynamics around the current
state, then computes the set of states that are provably reachable using the
locally learned dynamics and their corresponding maximum growth-rate bounds,
and finally synthesizes a control action that navigates the system to a
guaranteed reachable state.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法缺乏能够在微处理器平台上通过无线网络实现多机器人刚性编队导航的综合解决方案，特别是在需要穿越复杂曲线路径的情况下。

Method: 采用"hold-and-hit"通信控制框架与ROS平台无缝集成，结合周期内优化方法处理非完整运动约束，实现机器人运动的同步和精确路径跟踪。

Result: 仿真显示在S形路径上四机器人方形编队性能优于现有方法；实际实验中机器人间距误差在±0.069m内，角度误差在±19.15°内，以0.1m/s速度沿S形路径导航。

Conclusion: 提出的框架能够有效应对无线网络延迟和数据包丢失，实现多机器人在复杂曲线路径上的精确刚性编队导航。

Abstract: Rigid-formation navigation of multiple robots is essential for applications
such as cooperative transportation. This process involves a team of
collaborative robots maintaining a predefined geometric configuration, such as
a square, while in motion. For untethered collaborative motion, inter-robot
communication must be conducted through a wireless network. Notably, few
existing works offer a comprehensive solution for multi-robot formation
navigation executable on microprocessor platforms via wireless networks,
particularly for formations that must traverse complex curvilinear paths. To
address this gap, we introduce a novel "hold-and-hit" communication-control
framework designed to work seamlessly with the widely-used Robotic Operating
System (ROS) platform. The hold-and-hit framework synchronizes robot movements
in a manner robust against wireless network delays and packet loss. It operates
over discrete-time communication-control cycles, making it suitable for
implementation on contemporary microprocessors. Complementary to hold-and-hit,
we propose an intra-cycle optimization approach that enables rigid formations
to closely follow desired curvilinear paths, even under the nonholonomic
movement constraints inherent to most vehicular robots. The combination of
hold-and-hit and intra-cycle optimization ensures precise and reliable
navigation even in challenging scenarios. Simulations in a virtual environment
demonstrate the superiority of our method in maintaining a four-robot square
formation along an S-shaped path, outperforming two existing approaches.
Furthermore, real-world experiments validate the effectiveness of our
framework: the robots maintained an inter-distance error within $\pm 0.069m$
and an inter-angular orientation error within $\pm19.15^{\circ}$ while
navigating along an S-shaped path at a fixed linear velocity of $0.1 m/s$.

*Ruining Yang,Yi Xu,Yixiao Chen,Yun Fu,Lili Su*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一个轨迹生成框架，通过结构化网格表示和基于行为的生成机制，增强场景密度和行为多样性，解决现有数据集长尾分布问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有轨迹预测数据集存在明显的长尾分布问题，主要集中在低密度场景和简单直行行为，缺乏高密度场景和安全关键操作（如变道、超车、转弯）的充分表示，这阻碍了模型泛化能力并导致过于乐观的评估。

Method: 将连续道路环境转换为结构化网格表示，支持细粒度路径规划、显式冲突检测和多智能体协调。基于此表示，引入行为感知生成机制，结合基于规则的决策触发、Frenet轨迹平滑和动态可行性约束。

Result: 在Argoverse 1和Argoverse 2数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法显著提高了智能体密度和行为多样性，同时保持了运动真实性和场景级安全性。合成数据还提升了下游轨迹预测模型在挑战性高密度场景中的性能。

Conclusion: 该轨迹生成框架能够有效合成真实的高密度场景和复杂交互的稀有行为，弥补了真实数据中的不足，为自动驾驶轨迹预测提供了更全面的评估基础。

Abstract: Accurate trajectory prediction is fundamental to autonomous driving, as it
underpins safe motion planning and collision avoidance in complex environments.
However, existing benchmark datasets suffer from a pronounced long-tail
distribution problem, with most samples drawn from low-density scenarios and
simple straight-driving behaviors. This underrepresentation of high-density
scenarios and safety critical maneuvers such as lane changes, overtaking and
turning is an obstacle to model generalization and leads to overly optimistic
evaluations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel trajectory
generation framework that simultaneously enhances scenarios density and
enriches behavioral diversity. Specifically, our approach converts continuous
road environments into a structured grid representation that supports
fine-grained path planning, explicit conflict detection, and multi-agent
coordination. Built upon this representation, we introduce behavior-aware
generation mechanisms that combine rule-based decision triggers with
Frenet-based trajectory smoothing and dynamic feasibility constraints. This
design allows us to synthesize realistic high-density scenarios and rare
behaviors with complex interactions that are often missing in real data.
Extensive experiments on the large-scale Argoverse 1 and Argoverse 2 datasets
demonstrate that our method significantly improves both agent density and
behavior diversity, while preserving motion realism and scenario-level safety.
Our synthetic data also benefits downstream trajectory prediction models and
enhances performance in challenging high-density scenarios.

Motivation: 现有路径规划方法如A*、Dijkstra及其变体在小规模地图上表现良好，但在大规模地图上由于高搜索时间和内存消耗而失效。LLM-A*虽然利用大语言模型生成路径点，但在大规模地图上仍然存在高计算时间的问题。

Method: 设计了iLLM-A*算法，包含三个核心机制：A*算法优化、用于生成高质量路径点的LLM增量学习方法，以及为A*路径规划选择合适路径点的机制。

Result: 在各种网格地图上的综合评估显示，相比LLM-A*，iLLM-A*平均实现了超过1000倍的加速，极端情况下达到2349.5倍加速，节省了58.6%的内存成本，同时获得了明显更短的路径长度和更低的路径长度标准差。

Conclusion: iLLM-A*通过创新的机制设计有效解决了LLM-A*在大规模网格地图路径规划中的性能瓶颈，在计算效率、内存使用和路径质量方面都取得了显著提升。

Abstract: Path planning in grid maps, arising from various applications, has garnered
significant attention. Existing methods, such as A*, Dijkstra, and their
variants, work well for small-scale maps but fail to address large-scale ones
due to high search time and memory consumption. Recently, Large Language Models
(LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in path planning but still suffer from
spatial illusion and poor planning performance. Among all the works, LLM-A*
\cite{meng2024llm} leverages LLM to generate a series of waypoints and then
uses A* to plan the paths between the neighboring waypoints. In this way, the
complete path is constructed. However, LLM-A* still suffers from high
computational time for large-scale maps. To fill this gap, we conducted a deep
investigation into LLM-A* and found its bottleneck, resulting in limited
performance. Accordingly, we design an innovative LLM-enhanced algorithm, abbr.
as iLLM-A*. iLLM-A* includes 3 carefully designed mechanisms, including the
optimization of A*, an incremental learning method for LLM to generate
high-quality waypoints, and the selection of the appropriate waypoints for A*
for path planning. Finally, a comprehensive evaluation on various grid maps
shows that, compared with LLM-A*, iLLM-A* \textbf{1) achieves more than
$1000\times$ speedup on average, and up to $2349.5\times$ speedup in the
extreme case, 2) saves up to $58.6\%$ of the memory cost, 3) achieves both
obviously shorter path length and lower path length standard deviation.}

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决跨模态无人机导航中自然语言描述与视觉内容之间的细粒度语义匹配问题，特别是在复杂空中场景下，现有基线方法难以实现精确的语义匹配

Method: 首先使用基线模型获得前20个相关图像的粗排结果，然后使用视觉语言模型为候选图像生成详细描述，最后通过多模态相似度计算框架进行细粒度重排序

Conclusion: 语义细化策略在实际机器人导航场景中具有实用价值，能够有效构建视觉内容与自然语言描述之间的语义桥梁

Abstract: Cross-modal drone navigation remains a challenging task in robotics,
requiring efficient retrieval of relevant images from large-scale databases
based on natural language descriptions. The RoboSense 2025 Track 4 challenge
addresses this challenge, focusing on robust, natural language-guided
cross-view image retrieval across multiple platforms (drones, satellites, and
ground cameras). Current baseline methods, while effective for initial
retrieval, often struggle to achieve fine-grained semantic matching between
text queries and visual content, especially in complex aerial scenes. To
address this challenge, we propose a two-stage retrieval refinement method:
Caption-Guided Retrieval System (CGRS) that enhances the baseline coarse
ranking through intelligent reranking. Our method first leverages a baseline
model to obtain an initial coarse ranking of the top 20 most relevant images
for each query. We then use Vision-Language-Model (VLM) to generate detailed
captions for these candidate images, capturing rich semantic descriptions of
their visual content. These generated captions are then used in a multimodal
similarity computation framework to perform fine-grained reranking of the
original text query, effectively building a semantic bridge between the visual
content and natural language descriptions. Our approach significantly improves
upon the baseline, achieving a consistent 5\% improvement across all key
metrics (Recall@1, Recall@5, and Recall@10). Our approach win TOP-2 in the
challenge, demonstrating the practical value of our semantic refinement
strategy in real-world robotic navigation scenarios.

Motivation: 当前视觉运动策略在处理需要连续接触的机器人操作任务时，往往忽略顺应性和力的重要性，导致接触力过大或在不确定性下的脆弱行为

Method: 通过单次人类演示生成包含力信息的仿真数据，并与顺应性策略耦合，从合成数据中学习视觉运动策略

Result: 在真实机器人任务（包括非抓取式方块翻转和双手物体移动）中验证，学习到的策略展现出可靠的接触保持和对新条件的适应能力

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效解决接触丰富任务中的数据稀缺问题，通过力信息增强提高了视觉运动策略在物理交互中的鲁棒性

Abstract: While visuomotor policy has made advancements in recent years, contact-rich
tasks still remain a challenge. Robotic manipulation tasks that require
continuous contact demand explicit handling of compliance and force. However,
most visuomotor policies ignore compliance, overlooking the importance of
physical interaction with the real world, often leading to excessive contact
forces or fragile behavior under uncertainty. Introducing force information
into vision-based imitation learning could help improve awareness of contacts,
but could also require a lot of data to perform well. One remedy for data
scarcity is to generate data in simulation, yet computationally taxing
processes are required to generate data good enough not to suffer from the
Sim2Real gap. In this work, we introduce a framework for generating
force-informed data in simulation, instantiated by a single human
demonstration, and show how coupling with a compliant policy improves the
performance of a visuomotor policy learned from synthetic data. We validate our
approach on real-robot tasks, including non-prehensile block flipping and a
bi-manual object moving, where the learned policy exhibits reliable contact
maintenance and adaptation to novel conditions. Project Website:

TL;DR: 该论文首次系统研究视觉语言模型在工作区轨迹规划中的表现，发现主流VLMs在68%的情况下无法生成正确轨迹，并提出了REACT-Drive框架，通过检索增强生成技术显著提升了轨迹规划性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在自动驾驶中逐渐应用，但在包含不规则布局、临时交通控制和动态几何结构的工作区中，其轨迹规划能力尚未被探索。现有VLMs在工作区轨迹规划中存在严重失败问题。

Method: 提出REACT-Drive框架，结合检索增强生成技术：1）通过子图挖掘和聚类分析识别失败模式；2）利用VLMs将先验失败案例转化为约束规则和可执行代码；3）在新场景中检索相似模式来指导轨迹生成。

Result: 在ROADWork数据集上，REACT-Drive相比VLM基线平均位移误差减少约3倍，推理时间仅为0.58秒（远低于微调的17.90秒）。在15个真实工作区场景的实车实验中验证了强实用性。

Conclusion: REACT-Drive框架有效解决了VLMs在工作区轨迹规划中的失败问题，通过检索增强生成技术显著提升了规划准确性和效率，在真实场景中表现出强大的实用性。

Abstract: Visual Language Models (VLMs), with powerful multimodal reasoning
capabilities, are gradually integrated into autonomous driving by several
automobile manufacturers to enhance planning capability in challenging
environments. However, the trajectory planning capability of VLMs in work
zones, which often include irregular layouts, temporary traffic control, and
dynamically changing geometric structures, is still unexplored. To bridge this
gap, we conduct the \textit{first} systematic study of VLMs for work zone
trajectory planning, revealing that mainstream VLMs fail to generate correct
trajectories in $68.0%$ of cases. To better understand these failures, we first
identify candidate patterns via subgraph mining and clustering analysis, and
then confirm the validity of $8$ common failure patterns through human
verification. Building on these findings, we propose REACT-Drive, a trajectory
planning framework that integrates VLMs with Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG). Specifically, REACT-Drive leverages VLMs to convert prior failure cases
into constraint rules and executable trajectory planning code, while RAG
retrieves similar patterns in new scenarios to guide trajectory generation.
Experimental results on the ROADWork dataset show that REACT-Drive yields a
reduction of around $3\times$ in average displacement error relative to VLM
baselines under evaluation with Qwen2.5-VL. In addition, REACT-Drive yields the
lowest inference time ($0.58$s) compared with other methods such as fine-tuning
($17.90$s). We further conduct experiments using a real vehicle in 15 work zone
scenarios in the physical world, demonstrating the strong practicality of
REACT-Drive.

Motivation: 传统开环FES控制器使用固定刺激强度，存在过度刺激导致肌肉疲劳或刺激不足增加跌倒风险的问题。

Method: 开发闭环FES控制器，根据实时足尖间隙动态调整刺激强度，并在健康参与者中诱导足下垂，比较闭环与开环控制器在不同行走条件下的效果。

Result: 闭环控制器在维持足够足尖间隙的同时，显著降低了刺激强度，且未显著影响髋、膝、踝关节角度。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅匹配现有系统的有效性，还具备减少肌肉疲劳、提高长期用户舒适度和依从性的潜力。

Abstract: Foot drop is commonly managed using Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES),
typically delivered via open-loop controllers with fixed stimulation
intensities. While users may manually adjust the intensity through external
controls, this approach risks overstimulation, leading to muscle fatigue and
discomfort, or understimulation, which compromises dorsiflexion and increases
fall risk. In this study, we propose a novel closed-loop FES controller that
dynamically adjusts the stimulation intensity based on real-time toe clearance,
providing "assistance as needed". We evaluate this system by inducing foot drop
in healthy participants and comparing the effects of the closed-loop controller
with a traditional open-loop controller across various walking conditions,
including different speeds and surface inclinations. Kinematic data reveal that
our closed-loop controller maintains adequate toe clearance without
significantly affecting the joint angles of the hips, the knees, and the
ankles, and while using significantly lower stimulation intensities compared to
the open-loop controller. These findings suggest that the proposed method not
only matches the effectiveness of existing systems but also offers the
potential for reduced muscle fatigue and improved long-term user comfort and
adherence.

Result: 减少上行传输和服务器操作40%，端到端延迟降低33.32%，任务成功率可达目标模型单独推理的97.03%。

Conclusion: 动作偏差感知的混合推理能有效降低延迟和传输开销，同时保持接近目标模型的性能，适用于分布式机器学习中的行为克隆应用。

Abstract: To support latency-sensitive AI applications ranging from autonomous driving
to industrial robot manipulation, 6G envisions distributed ML, connecting
distributed computational resources in edge and cloud over hyper-reliable
low-latency communication (HRLLC). In this setting, speculative decoding can
facilitate collaborative inference of models distributively deployed: an
on-device draft model locally generates drafts and a remote server-based target
model verifies and corrects them, resulting lower latency. However, unlike
autoregressive text generation, behavior cloning policies, typically used for
embodied AI applications like robot manipulation and autonomous driving, cannot
parallelize verification and correction for multiple drafts as each action
depends on observation which needs to be updated by a previous action. To this
end, we propose Action Deviation-Aware Hybrid Inference, wherein the draft
model estimates an action's need for verification and correction by the target
model and selectively skips communication and computation for server
operations. Action deviation shows a strong correlation with action's rejection
probability by the target model, enabling selective skipping. We derive the
path deviation threshold that balances the transmission rate and the inference
performance, and we empirically show that action deviation-aware hybrid
inference reduces uplink transmission and server operation by 40%, while
lowering end-to-end latency by 33.32% relative to hybrid inference without
skipping and achieving task success rate up to 97.03% of that of target model
only inference.

Method: 通过移动机器人路径合成虚拟大孔径，生成合成孔径雷达图像，并评估SIFT、SURF、BRISK、AKAZE和ORB等经典特征检测器在UWB SAR图像上的闭环检测性能。

Conclusion: UWB SAR成像能够为机器人感知系统提供更鲁棒和可靠的环境建图与闭环检测能力。

Abstract: Traditional exteroceptive sensors in mobile robots, such as LiDARs and
cameras often struggle to perceive the environment in poor visibility
conditions. Recently, radar technologies, such as ultra-wideband (UWB) have
emerged as potential alternatives due to their ability to see through adverse
environmental conditions (e.g. dust, smoke and rain). However, due to the small
apertures with low directivity, the UWB radars cannot reconstruct a detailed
image of its field of view (FOV) using a single scan. Hence, a virtual large
aperture is synthesized by moving the radar along a mobile robot path. The
resulting synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image is a high-definition
representation of the surrounding environment. Hence, this paper proposes a
pipeline for mobile robots to incorporate UWB radar-based SAR imaging to map an
unknown environment. Finally, we evaluated the performance of classical feature
detectors: SIFT, SURF, BRISK, AKAZE and ORB to identify loop closures using UWB
SAR images. The experiments were conducted emulating adverse environmental
conditions. The results demonstrate the viability and effectiveness of UWB SAR
imaging for high-resolution environmental mapping and loop closure detection
toward more robust and reliable robotic perception systems.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel motion planning algorithm to facilitate
safety-critical navigation for autonomous mobile robots. The proposed algorithm
integrates a real-time dynamic obstacle tracking and mapping system that
categorizes point clouds into dynamic and static components. For dynamic point
clouds, the Kalman filter is employed to estimate and predict their motion
states. Based on these predictions, we extrapolate the future states of dynamic
point clouds, which are subsequently merged with static point clouds to
construct the forward-time-domain (FTD) map. By combining control barrier
functions (CBFs) with nonlinear model predictive control, the proposed
algorithm enables the robot to effectively avoid both static and dynamic
obstacles. The CBF constraints are formulated based on risk points identified
through collision detection between the predicted future states and the FTD
map. Experimental results from both simulated and real-world scenarios
demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm in complex environments. In
simulation experiments, the proposed algorithm is compared with two baseline
approaches, showing superior performance in terms of safety and robustness in
obstacle avoidance. The source code is released for the reference of the
robotics community.

Result: 当前指标能捕捉机器人导航行为的某些方面，但重要的主观因素仍未充分体现，需要开发新指标。

Conclusion: 现有数值指标不足以完全代表人类感知，需要开发新的指标来更好地评估社交导航系统。

Abstract: Social, also called human-aware, navigation is a key challenge for the
integration of mobile robots into human environments. The evaluation of such
systems is complex, as factors such as comfort, safety, and legibility must be
considered. Human-centered assessments, typically conducted through surveys,
provide reliable insights but are costly, resource-intensive, and difficult to
reproduce or compare across systems. Alternatively, numerical social navigation
metrics are easy to compute and facilitate comparisons, yet the community lacks
consensus on a standard set of metrics.
  This work explores the relationship between numerical metrics and
human-centered evaluations to identify potential correlations. If specific
quantitative measures align with human perceptions, they could serve as
standardized evaluation tools, reducing the dependency on surveys. Our results
indicate that while current metrics capture some aspects of robot navigation
behavior, important subjective factors remain insufficiently represented and
new metrics are necessary.

Conclusion: 成功实现了最小配置摆荡机器人的机电设计和控制，连续控制策略在实际系统中表现良好，为后续跳跃阶段奠定了基础。

Abstract: A complete mechatronic design of a minimal configuration brachiation robot is
presented. The robot consists of a single rigid rod with gripper mechanisms
attached to both ends. The grippers are used to hang the robot on a horizontal
bar on which it swings or rotates. The motion is imposed by repositioning the
robot's center of mass, which is performed using a crank-slide mechanism. Based
on a non-linear model, an optimal control strategy is proposed, for
repositioning the center of mass in a bang-bang manner. Consequently, utilizing
the concept of input-output linearization, a continuous control strategy is
proposed that takes into account the limited torque of the crank-slide
mechanism and its geometry. An increased attention is paid to energy
accumulation towards the subsequent jump stage of the brachiation. These two
strategies are validated and compared in simulations. The continuous control
strategy is then also implemented within a low-cost STM32-based control system,
and both the swing and rotation stages of the brachiation motion are
experimentally validated.

Abstract: Achieving precise lateral motion modeling and decoupled control in hover
remains a significant challenge for tail-sitter Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
(UAVs), primarily due to complex aerodynamic couplings and the absence of
welldefined lateral dynamics. This paper presents a novel modeling and control
strategy that enhances yaw authority and lateral motion by introducing a
sideslip force model derived from differential propeller slipstream effects
acting on the fuselage under differential thrust. The resulting lateral force
along the body y-axis enables yaw-based lateral position control without
inducing roll coupling. The control framework employs a YXZ Euler rotation
formulation to accurately represent attitude and incorporate gravitational
components while directly controlling yaw in the yaxis, thereby improving
lateral dynamic behavior and avoiding singularities. The proposed approach is
validated through trajectory-tracking simulations conducted in a Unity-based
environment. Tests on both rectangular and circular paths in hover mode
demonstrate stable performance, with low mean absolute position errors and yaw
deviations constrained within 5.688 degrees. These results confirm the
effectiveness of the proposed lateral force generation model and provide a
foundation for the development of agile, hover-capable tail-sitter UAVs.

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for real-time optimal controlling of a
heavy-duty skid-steered mobile platform for trajectory tracking. The importance
of accurate real-time performance of the controller lies in safety
considerations of situations where the dynamic system under control is affected
by uncertainties and disturbances, and the controller should compensate for
such phenomena in order to provide stable performance. A multiple-shooting
nonlinear model-predictive control framework is proposed in this paper. This
framework benefits from suitable algorithm along with readings from various
sensors for genuine real-time performance with extremely high accuracy. The
controller is then tested for tracking different trajectories where it
demonstrates highly desirable performance in terms of both speed and accuracy.
This controller shows remarkable improvement when compared to existing
nonlinear model-predictive controllers in the literature that were implemented
on skid-steered mobile platforms.

Abstract: Diffusion models, as a class of deep generative models, have recently emerged
as powerful tools for robot skills by enabling stable training with reliable
convergence. In this paper, we present an end-to-end framework for generating
long, smooth trajectories that explicitly target high surface coverage across
various industrial tasks, including polishing, robotic painting, and spray
coating. The conventional methods are always fundamentally constrained by their
predefined functional forms, which limit the shapes of the trajectories they
can represent and make it difficult to handle complex and diverse tasks.
Moreover, their generalization is poor, often requiring manual redesign or
extensive parameter tuning when applied to new scenarios. These limitations
highlight the need for more expressive generative models, making
diffusion-based approaches a compelling choice for trajectory generation. By
iteratively denoising trajectories with carefully learned noise schedules and
conditioning mechanisms, diffusion models not only ensure smooth and consistent
motion but also flexibly adapt to the task context. In experiments, our method
improves trajectory continuity, maintains high coverage, and generalizes to
unseen shapes, paving the way for unified end-to-end trajectory learning across
industrial surface-processing tasks without category-specific models. On
average, our approach improves Point-wise Chamfer Distance by 98.2\% and
smoothness by 97.0\%, while increasing surface coverage by 61\% compared to

TL;DR: HumanoidExo是一个将人类运动转换为全身人形机器人数据的系统，解决了人形机器人政策学习中大规模多样化数据集获取的瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人形机器人政策学习面临大规模多样化数据集获取困难且成本高昂的问题，真实世界数据收集既困难又昂贵。

Method: 通过HumanoidExo系统将人类运动转换为全身人形机器人数据，最小化人类演示者与机器人之间的体现差距。

Result: 在三个具有挑战性的真实世界任务中评估，证明HumanoidExo能够使人形政策泛化到新环境，仅需5个真实机器人演示就能学习复杂全身控制，甚至仅从HumanoidExo数据就能学习新技能（如行走）。

Conclusion: HumanoidExo是对真实机器人数据的重要补充，显著提升了人形机器人在动态真实场景中的性能。

Abstract: A significant bottleneck in humanoid policy learning is the acquisition of
large-scale, diverse datasets, as collecting reliable real-world data remains
both difficult and cost-prohibitive. To address this limitation, we introduce
HumanoidExo, a novel system that transfers human motion to whole-body humanoid
data. HumanoidExo offers a high-efficiency solution that minimizes the
embodiment gap between the human demonstrator and the robot, thereby tackling
the scarcity of whole-body humanoid data. By facilitating the collection of
more voluminous and diverse datasets, our approach significantly enhances the
performance of humanoid robots in dynamic, real-world scenarios. We evaluated
our method across three challenging real-world tasks: table-top manipulation,
manipulation integrated with stand-squat motions, and whole-body manipulation.
Our results empirically demonstrate that HumanoidExo is a crucial addition to
real-robot data, as it enables the humanoid policy to generalize to novel
environments, learn complex whole-body control from only five real-robot
demonstrations, and even acquire new skills (i.e., walking) solely from
HumanoidExo data.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于动态地图(MoDs)的长期人体运动预测框架，支持多种MoD类型，并引入时间条件MoD来捕捉不同时间段的变化模式，在60秒预测范围内显著优于基于学习的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长期人体运动预测对于自主机器人和车辆在人类共享环境中的安全高效运行至关重要，需要准确预测来支持运动规划、人机交互和安全监控等应用。

Method: 利用动态地图(MoDs)编码空间或时空运动模式作为环境特征，提出MoD-informed LHMP框架，支持多种MoD类型，包含排名方法输出最可能的预测轨迹，并引入时间条件MoD。

Result: 在两个真实世界数据集上的实验表明，MoD-informed方法优于基于学习的方法，平均位移误差改善高达50%，时间条件变体在所有方法中达到最高准确率。

Conclusion: 动态地图能够有效提升长期人体运动预测性能，时间条件MoD进一步提高了预测准确性，为机器人应用提供了实用价值。

Abstract: Long-term human motion prediction (LHMP) is important for the safe and
efficient operation of autonomous robots and vehicles in environments shared
with humans. Accurate predictions are important for applications including
motion planning, tracking, human-robot interaction, and safety monitoring. In
this paper, we exploit Maps of Dynamics (MoDs), which encode spatial or
spatio-temporal motion patterns as environment features, to achieve LHMP for
horizons of up to 60 seconds. We propose an MoD-informed LHMP framework that
supports various types of MoDs and includes a ranking method to output the most
likely predicted trajectory, improving practical utility in robotics. Further,
a time-conditioned MoD is introduced to capture motion patterns that vary
across different times of day. We evaluate MoD-LHMP instantiated with three
types of MoDs. Experiments on two real-world datasets show that MoD-informed
method outperforms learning-based ones, with up to 50\% improvement in average
displacement error, and the time-conditioned variant achieves the highest
accuracy overall. Project code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前研究主要关注固定机器人结构的控制策略优化，但为了实现真正适应多样化现实环境的人形机器人，需要同时考虑控制智能和形态适应性。

Method: 提出基于战略探索、Sim2Real迁移和元策略学习的实用协同设计方法，从方法论、应用驱动和社区导向三个角度分析协同设计的必要性。

Result: 建立了协同设计作为开发下一代智能适应人形机器人基石的框架，提出了从短期创新到长期目标的开放研究问题。

Conclusion: 协同设计是实现真正具身智能人形机器人的关键，需要同时进化控制策略和物理结构，以优化在特定任务和资源受限环境中的性能。

Abstract: Humanoid robots, as general-purpose physical agents, must integrate both
intelligent control and adaptive morphology to operate effectively in diverse
real-world environments. While recent research has focused primarily on
optimizing control policies for fixed robot structures, this position paper
argues for evolving both control strategies and humanoid robots' physical
structure under a co-design mechanism. Inspired by biological evolution, this
approach enables robots to iteratively adapt both their form and behavior to
optimize performance within task-specific and resource-constrained contexts.
Despite its promise, co-design in humanoid robotics remains a relatively
underexplored domain, raising fundamental questions about its feasibility and
necessity in achieving true embodied intelligence. To address these challenges,
we propose practical co-design methodologies grounded in strategic exploration,
Sim2Real transfer, and meta-policy learning. We further argue for the essential
role of co-design by analyzing it from methodological, application-driven, and
community-oriented perspectives. Striving to guide and inspire future studies,
we present open research questions, spanning from short-term innovations to
long-term goals. This work positions co-design as a cornerstone for developing
the next generation of intelligent and adaptable humanoid agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微型飞行机器人在搜救、安全检查和环境监测中具有巨大潜力，但其小尺寸限制了传统传感能力，特别是在光线不足、烟雾、灰尘或反射障碍物环境中。

Method: 受自然界启发，开发了基于气压计的胡须传感器系统，使用触觉深度估计方法处理传感器噪声和漂移，在192KB RAM微控制器上实现完全机载自主触觉飞行。

Result: 系统实现了亚6毫米精度的触觉深度估计，使无人机能够在完全黑暗的环境中仅通过触觉导航、绕行障碍物和探索受限空间，支持软性和刚性表面。

Conclusion: 这种仿生方法重新定义了无视觉导航，为微型飞行器在极端环境中开辟了新的可能性。

Abstract: Tiny flying robots hold great potential for search-and-rescue, safety
inspections, and environmental monitoring, but their small size limits
conventional sensing-especially with poor-lighting, smoke, dust or reflective
obstacles. Inspired by nature, we propose a lightweight, 3.2-gram,
whisker-based tactile sensing apparatus for tiny drones, enabling them to
navigate and explore through gentle physical interaction. Just as rats and
moles use whiskers to perceive surroundings, our system equips drones with
tactile perception in flight, allowing obstacle sensing even in pitch-dark
conditions. The apparatus uses barometer-based whisker sensors to detect
obstacle locations while minimising destabilisation. To address sensor noise
and drift, we develop a tactile depth estimation method achieving sub-6 mm
accuracy. This enables drones to navigate, contour obstacles, and explore
confined spaces solely through touch-even in total darkness along both soft and
rigid surfaces. Running fully onboard a 192-KB RAM microcontroller, the system
supports autonomous tactile flight and is validated in both simulation and
real-world tests. Our bio-inspired approach redefines vision-free navigation,
opening new possibilities for micro aerial vehicles in extreme environments.

Motivation: 传统稳定性证书推导需要明确的系统动力学知识，对于复杂未知系统来说很困难。本文旨在开发一种数据驱动的方法来认证机器人系统的稳定性

Method: 使用神经网络参数化李雅普诺夫候选函数，通过Cholesky分解确保正定性，允许稳定性条件的受控违反以处理噪声数据

Result: 该框架能够提供数据驱动的稳定性保证，即使在无法访问内部控制算法的情况下也能有效工作

Conclusion: 该方法为动态现实环境中机器人系统的安全性认证提供了一种稳健的方法，相关工具已开源

Abstract: Stability certificates play a critical role in ensuring the safety and
reliability of robotic systems. However, deriving these certificates for
complex, unknown systems has traditionally required explicit knowledge of
system dynamics, often making it a daunting task. This work introduces a novel
framework that learns a Lyapunov function directly from trajectory data,
enabling the certification of stability for autonomous systems without needing
detailed system models. By parameterizing the Lyapunov candidate using a neural
network and ensuring positive definiteness through Cholesky factorization, our
approach automatically identifies whether the system is stable under the given
trajectory. To address the challenges posed by noisy, real-world data, we allow
for controlled violations of the stability condition, focusing on maintaining
high confidence in the stability certification process. Our results demonstrate
that this framework can provide data-driven stability guarantees, offering a
robust method for certifying the safety of robotic systems in dynamic,
real-world environments. This approach works without access to the internal
control algorithms, making it applicable even in situations where system
behavior is opaque or proprietary. The tool for learning the stability proof is
open-sourced by this research: https://github.com/HansOersted/stability.

TL;DR: 提出MM-Nav多视角视觉语言动作模型，通过师生学习方式从合成专家数据中学习多样化导航能力，在合成和真实环境中都表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉导航策略使用自我中心视觉观察进行导航，但光学信息难以像LiDAR或深度图那样显式建模，需要智能模型和大规模数据。

Method: 基于预训练大语言模型和视觉基础模型实现多视角VLA模型MM-Nav，从三个具有特权深度信息的RL专家收集数据，采用动态平衡训练比例的在线迭代训练。

Result: 模型在合成环境中展现出强大的泛化能力，学生VLA模型甚至超越了RL教师模型，体现了多种能力整合的协同效应。

Conclusion: 该方法通过师生学习和多能力整合，有效提升了视觉导航性能，在真实世界实验中进一步验证了有效性。

Abstract: Visual navigation policy is widely regarded as a promising direction, as it
mimics humans by using egocentric visual observations for navigation. However,
optical information of visual observations is difficult to be explicitly
modeled like LiDAR point clouds or depth maps, which subsequently requires
intelligent models and large-scale data. To this end, we propose to leverage
the intelligence of the Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model to learn diverse
navigation capabilities from synthetic expert data in a teacher-student manner.
Specifically, we implement the VLA model, MM-Nav, as a multi-view VLA (with 360
observations) based on pretrained large language models and visual foundation
models. For large-scale navigation data, we collect expert data from three
reinforcement learning (RL) experts trained with privileged depth information
in three challenging tailor-made environments for different navigation
capabilities: reaching, squeezing, and avoiding. We iteratively train our VLA
model using data collected online from RL experts, where the training ratio is
dynamically balanced based on performance on individual capabilities. Through
extensive experiments in synthetic environments, we demonstrate that our model
achieves strong generalization capability. Moreover, we find that our student
VLA model outperforms the RL teachers, demonstrating the synergistic effect of
integrating multiple capabilities. Extensive real-world experiments further
confirm the effectiveness of our method.

<details>

Motivation: 针对无人机在电网等复杂环境中的覆盖应用需求，需要规划既能高效访问所有兴趣点又满足平滑性、时间和避障约束的轨迹。

Method: 前端使用遗传算法解决旅行商问题生成初始访问序列，后端通过非线性最小二乘问题优化轨迹平滑度、时间消耗和障碍物避让。

Result: 数值仿真验证了算法的有效性，确保无人机能够在复杂环境中平滑覆盖所有兴趣点。

Conclusion: 该算法能够为无人机在电网等复杂场景中提供优化的平滑覆盖轨迹规划解决方案。

Abstract: For typical applications of UAVs in power grid scenarios, we construct the
problem as planning UAV trajectories for coverage in cluttered environments. In
this paper, we propose an optimal smooth coverage trajectory planning
algorithm. The algorithm consists of two stages. In the front-end, a Genetic
Algorithm (GA) is employed to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) for
Points of Interest (POIs), generating an initial sequence of optimized visiting
points. In the back-end, the sequence is further optimized by considering
trajectory smoothness, time consumption, and obstacle avoidance. This is
formulated as a nonlinear least squares problem and solved to produce a smooth
coverage trajectory that satisfies these constraints. Numerical simulations
validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, ensuring UAVs can
smoothly cover all POIs in cluttered environments.

TL;DR: VLMFP是一个双VLM引导的框架，能够自主生成PDDL问题和领域文件，用于视觉规划任务。它通过SimVLM模拟动作结果和GenVLM迭代优化PDDL文件，解决了传统方法在生成PDDL领域文件方面的困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在视觉规划中表现出潜力，但在精确空间和长时程推理方面存在困难；而PDDL规划器擅长形式化规划但无法处理视觉输入。现有方法需要人工预定义领域文件或持续环境访问，限制了自主性。

Method: 提出VLMFP框架，包含两个VLM：SimVLM基于输入规则描述模拟动作结果，GenVLM通过比较PDDL和SimVLM执行结果来生成和迭代优化PDDL文件。

Result: 在6个网格世界领域测试中，SimVLM在可见和未见外观下分别准确描述95.5%、82.6%场景，模拟85.5%、87.8%动作序列，判断82.4%、85.6%目标达成。VLMFP在可见和未见外观下分别生成70.0%、54.1%的有效规划。

Conclusion: VLMFP能够自主生成PDDL文件，实现多层次的泛化能力：同一生成的PDDL领域文件适用于同一问题下的所有不同实例，且VLM能够泛化到具有不同外观和规则的问题。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) show strong potential for visual planning but
struggle with precise spatial and long-horizon reasoning. In contrast, Planning
Domain Definition Language (PDDL) planners excel at long-horizon formal
planning, but cannot interpret visual inputs. Recent works combine these
complementary advantages by enabling VLMs to turn visual planning problems into
PDDL files for formal planning. However, while VLMs can generate PDDL problem
files satisfactorily, they struggle to accurately generate the PDDL domain
files, which describe all the planning rules. As a result, prior methods rely
on human experts to predefine domain files or on constant environment access
for refinement. We propose VLMFP, a Dual-VLM-guided framework that can
autonomously generate both PDDL problem and domain files for formal visual
planning. VLMFP introduces two VLMs to ensure reliable PDDL file generation: A
SimVLM that simulates action consequences based on input rule descriptions, and
a GenVLM that generates and iteratively refines PDDL files by comparing the
PDDL and SimVLM execution results. VLMFP unleashes multiple levels of
generalizability: The same generated PDDL domain file works for all the
different instances under the same problem, and VLMs generalize to different
problems with varied appearances and rules. We evaluate VLMFP with 6 grid-world
domains and test its generalization to unseen instances, appearance, and game
rules. On average, SimVLM accurately describes 95.5%, 82.6% of scenarios,
simulates 85.5%, 87.8% of action sequence, and judges 82.4%, 85.6% goal
reaching for seen and unseen appearances, respectively. With the guidance of
SimVLM, VLMFP can generate PDDL files to reach 70.0%, 54.1% valid plans for
unseen instances in seen and unseen appearances, respectively. Project page:

Abstract: Understanding how diverse individuals and communities respond to persuasive
messaging holds significant potential for advancing personalized and socially
aware machine learning. While Large Vision and Language Models (VLMs) offer
promise, their ability to emulate nuanced, heterogeneous human responses,
particularly in high stakes domains like public health, remains underexplored
due in part to the lack of comprehensive, multimodal dataset. We introduce
PHORECAST (Public Health Outreach REceptivity and CAmpaign Signal Tracking), a
multimodal dataset curated to enable fine-grained prediction of both
individuallevel behavioral responses and community-wide engagement patterns to
health messaging. This dataset supports tasks in multimodal understanding,
response prediction, personalization, and social forecasting, allowing rigorous
evaluation of how well modern AI systems can emulate, interpret, and anticipate
heterogeneous public sentiment and behavior. By providing a new dataset to
enable AI advances for public health, PHORECAST aims to catalyze the
development of models that are not only more socially aware but also aligned
with the goals of adaptive and inclusive health communication

Motivation: 算法决策和人工智能在预测犯罪、招聘、贷款等方面应用广泛，但可能威胁人权特别是非歧视权，需要评估现有法律保护的有效性。

Method: 通过分析欧洲现行非歧视法和数据保护法，评估其对算法歧视的适用性和保护效果。

Result: 非歧视法（特别是间接歧视概念）和数据保护法可以禁止许多算法歧视，但两种法律工具在应用于人工智能时都存在严重缺陷。

Conclusion: 需要改进现有规则的执法，并制定特定行业而非通用的规则来规制算法决策，以更好地保护人们免受算法歧视。

Abstract: Algorithmic decision-making and other types of artificial intelligence (AI)
can be used to predict who will commit crime, who will be a good employee, who
will default on a loan, etc. However, algorithmic decision-making can also
threaten human rights, such as the right to non-discrimination. The paper
evaluates current legal protection in Europe against discriminatory algorithmic
decisions. The paper shows that non-discrimination law, in particular through
the concept of indirect discrimination, prohibits many types of algorithmic
discrimination. Data protection law could also help to defend people against
discrimination. Proper enforcement of non-discrimination law and data
protection law could help to protect people. However, the paper shows that both
legal instruments have severe weaknesses when applied to artificial
intelligence. The paper suggests how enforcement of current rules can be
improved. The paper also explores whether additional rules are needed. The
paper argues for sector-specific - rather than general - rules, and outlines an
approach to regulate algorithmic decision-making.

Motivation: 研究欧洲在线政治微定向的监管框架，填补该领域具体规则缺失的空白。

Method: 聚焦数据保护法、言论自由和政治广告的部门特定规则三个法律领域，并考察四个国家的相关法规。

Result: 发现GDPR规则必要但不充分，政治广告受言论自由保护但可被合法限制，一些国家在选举期间禁止政党电视广告。

Conclusion: 欧洲需要更全面的监管框架来规范在线政治微定向，现有法律工具存在局限性。

Abstract: In this paper, we examine how online political micro-targeting is regulated
in Europe. While there are no specific rules on such micro-targeting, there are
general rules that apply. We focus on three fields of law: data protection law,
freedom of expression, and sector-specific rules for political advertising; for
the latter we examine four countries. We argue that the rules in the General
Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) are necessary, but not sufficient. We show
that political advertising, including online political micro-targeting, is
protected by the right to freedom of expression. That right is not absolute,
however. From a European human rights perspective, it is possible for lawmakers
to limit the possibilities for political advertising. Indeed, some countries
ban TV advertising for political parties during elections.

Method: 通过解释GDPR的起源（作为1995年数据保护指令的延伸和细化）、描述其方法和条款，并与美国隐私法进行比较分析。

Result: GDPR鼓励企业开发信息治理框架，将数据使用内部化，并在决策中保持人工参与。与消费者有直接关系的公司在GDPR下具有战略优势。

Conclusion: GDPR将复杂化和限制某些信息密集型商业模式，但同时也将实现以往在较少保护方法下不可能实现的方法。GDPR主要使用严厉惩罚措施，而激励机制较少。

Abstract: This paper introduces the strategic approach to regulating personal data and
the normative foundations of the European Union's General Data Protection
Regulation ('GDPR'). We explain the genesis of the GDPR, which is best
understood as an extension and refinement of existing requirements imposed by
the 1995 Data Protection Directive; describe the GDPR's approach and
provisions; and make predictions about the GDPR's implications. We also
highlight where the GDPR takes a different approach than U.S. privacy law. The
GDPR is the most consequential regulatory development in information policy in
a generation. The GDPR brings personal data into a detailed regulatory regime,
that will influence personal data usage worldwide. Understood properly, the
GDPR encourages firms to develop information governance frameworks, to in-house
data use, and to keep humans in the loop in decision making. Companies with
direct relationships with consumers have strategic advantages under the GDPR,
compared to third party advertising firms on the internet. To reach these
objectives, the GDPR uses big sticks, structural elements that make proving
violations easier, but only a few carrots. The GDPR will complicate and
restrain some information-intensive business models. But the GDPR will also
enable approaches previously impossible under less-protective approaches.

Conclusion: 美具有现实主义基础，机器能够产生新颖的创造性见解，人机协同创作是可能的且具有基础性意义。

Abstract: What does it mean for a machine to recognize beauty? While beauty remains a
culturally and experientially compelling but philosophically elusive concept,
deep learning systems increasingly appear capable of modeling aesthetic
judgment. In this paper, we explore the capacity of neural networks to
represent beauty despite the immense formal diversity of objects for which the
term applies. By drawing on recent work on cross-model representational
convergence, we show how aesthetic content produces more similar and aligned
representations between models which have been trained on distinct data and
modalities - while unaesthetic images do not produce more aligned
representations. This finding implies that the formal structure of beautiful
images has a realist basis - rather than only as a reflection of socially
constructed values. Furthermore, we propose that these realist representations
exist because of a joint grounding of aesthetic form in physical and cultural
substance. We argue that human perceptual and creative acts play a central role
in shaping these the latent spaces of deep learning systems, but that a realist
basis for aesthetics shows that machines are not mere creative parrots but can
produce novel creative insights from the unique vantage point of scale. Our
findings suggest that human-machine co-creation is not merely possible, but
foundational - with beauty serving as a teleological attractor in both cultural
production and machine perception.

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is reshaping higher education and
raising pressing concerns about the integrity and validity of higher education
assessment. While assessment redesign is increasingly seen as a necessity,
there is a relative lack of literature detailing what such redesign may entail.
In this paper, we introduce assessment twins as an accessible approach for
redesigning assessment tasks to enhance validity. We use Messick's unified
validity framework to systematically map the ways in which GenAI threaten
content, structural, consequential, generalisability, and external validity.
Following this, we define assessment twins as two deliberately linked
components that address the same learning outcomes through different modes of
evidence, scheduled closely together to allow for cross-verification and
assurance of learning.
  We argue that the twin approach helps mitigate validity threats by
triangulating evidence across complementary formats, such as pairing essays
with oral defences, group discussions, or practical demonstrations. We
highlight several advantages: preservation of established assessment formats,
reduction of reliance on surveillance technologies, and flexible use across
cohort sizes. To guide implementation, we propose a three-step design process:
identifying vulnerabilities, aligning outcomes, selecting complementary tasks,
and developing interdependent marking schemes. We also acknowledge the
challenges, including resource intensity, equity concerns, and the need for
empirical validation. Nonetheless, we contend that assessment twins represent a
validity-focused response to GenAI that prioritises pedagogy while supporting
meaningful student learning outcomes.

Abstract: Proactive preservation of steel structures at culturally significant heritage
sites like the San Sebastian Basilica in the Philippines requires accurate
corrosion forecasting. This study developed an Internet of Things hardware
system connected with LoRa wireless communications to monitor heritage
buildings with steel structures. From a three year dataset generated by the IoT
system, we built a machine learning framework for predicting atmospheric
corrosion rates using only temperature and relative humidity data. Deployed via
a Streamlit dashboard with ngrok tunneling for public access, the framework
provides real-time corrosion monitoring and actionable preservation
recommendations. This minimal-data approach is scalable and cost effective for
heritage sites with limited monitoring resources, showing that advanced
regression can extract accurate corrosion predictions from basic meteorological
data enabling proactive preservation of culturally significant structures
worldwide without requiring extensive sensor networks

*Caoilte Ó Ciardha,John Buckley,Rebecca S. Portnoff*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 生成式AI工具能够制作合成儿童性虐待材料(AI CSAM)，这给儿童保护带来严峻挑战。虽然有人认为AI CSAM因缺乏直接受害者而危害较小，但这种观点忽视了其生产消费过程中的多种风险，包括对未受害儿童的合成、已知受害者的再伤害、助长诱骗勒索、以及使儿童性剥削正常化等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨生成式AI在制作儿童性虐待材料方面带来的新挑战，批判那些认为AI CSAM危害较小的观点，强调其真实风险并警示将其视为减害工具的错误认知。

Method: 分析AI CSAM的关键技术，批判性评估其相关危害，并反驳将其作为减害工具的主张。

Result: 识别出AI CSAM的多种风险：合成未受害儿童材料、再伤害已知受害者、助长诱骗勒索、使儿童性剥削正常化、降低犯罪门槛、使用户对极端内容脱敏等。

Conclusion: AI CSAM具有真实且严重的危害，不应被视为减害工具。对其无害性的错误主张会掩盖真实风险，并导致生态系统应对措施的惰性。

Abstract: The development of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools capable of
producing wholly or partially synthetic child sexual abuse material (AI CSAM)
presents profound challenges for child protection, law enforcement, and
societal responses to child exploitation. While some argue that the harmfulness
of AI CSAM differs fundamentally from other CSAM due to a perceived absence of
direct victimization, this perspective fails to account for the range of risks
associated with its production and consumption. AI has been implicated in the
creation of synthetic CSAM of children who have not previously been abused, the
revictimization of known survivors of abuse, the facilitation of grooming,
coercion and sexual extortion, and the normalization of child sexual
exploitation. Additionally, AI CSAM may serve as a new or enhanced pathway into
offending by lowering barriers to engagement, desensitizing users to
progressively extreme content, and undermining protective factors for
individuals with a sexual interest in children. This paper provides a primer on
some key technologies, critically examines the harms associated with AI CSAM,
and cautions against claims that it may function as a harm reduction tool,
emphasizing how some appeals to harmlessness obscure its real risks and may
contribute to inertia in ecosystem responses.

Abstract: Use of sensor and related analytical predictions can be a powerful tool in
providing data-informed input to viticulturalists' decision process,
complementing their vineyard observations and intuition. Their up-to-date
measurements, predictions, and alerts offer actionable insights and suggestions
for managing key vineyard operations, such as irrigation, disease and pest
control, canopy management, and harvest timing. In many cases, anticipatory
interventions can mitigate risks before problems become apparent. By offering
guidance on the targeting, timing, and dosage of vineyard practices, sensor
data platforms can enhance operational effectiveness and efficiency while
conserving labor and resources when they are not required. They also enable
implementation of the principles of precision viticulture - doing the right
thing, at the right time, in the right place. This paper provides a succinct
summary of the functions, benefits, and practical considerations of sensor data
platforms in viticulture. It may be of interest to viticulturalists as well as
agricultural and IoT researchers.

TL;DR: 本研究调查了不同类型教育机构（高中、学院、研究型大学）中计算机专业学生对生成式AI的使用和态度差异，发现不同教育层次的学生在AI使用模式、情感态度和职业选择影响方面存在显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI在教育领域的广泛应用，需要更细致地了解不同教育类型中学生对AI的使用和认知差异，但目前缺乏跨教育类型的比较研究。

Method: 采用多机构调查方法，收集了来自23所教育机构（高中、学院、研究型大学）的410名计算机专业学生的问卷数据。

Result: 发现三种教育机构类型中存在明显不同的AI使用模式；所有学生都表现出对生成式AI的兴奋、乐观和感激；高等教育学生更常报告担忧和怀疑，而高中生表现出更多信任和较少负面情绪；AI热潮对高中生选择计算机专业的影响很小。

Conclusion: 研究有助于理解不同教育机构间AI使用和认知的差异，能为教育工作者和学生更好地应对未来AI在教育中的挑战提供参考。

Abstract: The application of Artificial Intelligence, in particular Generative AI, has
become more widespread among educational institutions. Opinions vary widely on
whether integrating AI into classrooms is the way forward or if it is
detrimental to the quality of education. Increasingly, research studies are
giving us more insight into the consequences of using AI tools in learning and
teaching. Studies have shown how, when, and why students use AI tools. Because
developments regarding the technology and its use are moving fast, we need
frequent, ongoing, and more fine-grained investigation. One aspect that we do
not know much about yet is how students use and think about AI across
\textit{different types of education}. In this paper, we present the results of
a multi-institutional survey with responses from 410 students enrolled in the
computing programs of 23 educational institutions, representing high schools,
colleges, and research universities. We found distinct usage patterns across
the three educational institution types. Students from all types express
excitement, optimism, and gratitude toward GenAI. Students in higher education
more often report worry and skepticism, while high school students report
greater trust and fewer negative feelings. Additionally, the AI hype has had a
minimal influence, positive or negative, on high school students' decision to
pursue computing. Our study contributes to a better understanding of
inter-institutional differences in AI usage and perception and can help
educators and students better prepare for future challenges related to AI in
computing education.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BrowserArena是一个实时开放网络代理评估平台，通过用户提交任务、Arena式对决比较和步骤级人工反馈来识别网络代理的失败模式，发现了验证码解决、弹窗横幅移除和直接URL导航三个主要问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前网络代理评估局限于沙盒环境或人工任务，需要真实开放网络环境下的评估平台来识别代理的实际失败模式。

Method: 构建BrowserArena平台，收集用户任务，进行Arena式对决，使用步骤级人工反馈分析代理轨迹，并针对发现的失败模式构建专门数据集进行深入研究。

Result: 识别出三个一致的失败模式：验证码解决、弹窗横幅移除和直接URL导航。不同语言模型在这些任务上表现各异，如o4-mini使用更多策略绕过验证码，而DeepSeek-R1在验证码解决上误导用户。

Conclusion: 当前网络代理表现出多样性和脆弱性，该基准测试方法为大规模评估和理解网络代理失败模式提供了有效途径。

Abstract: LLM web agents now browse and take actions on the open web, yet current agent
evaluations are constrained to sandboxed environments or artificial tasks. We
introduce BrowserArena, a live open-web agent evaluation platform that collects
user-submitted tasks, runs Arena-style head-to-head comparisons, and uses
step-level human feedback to surface failure modes. Collecting and analyzing
step-level annotations on the agent traces, we identify three consistent
failure modes: captcha resolution, pop-up banner removal, and direct navigation
to URLs. By constructing targeted datasets to further study these tasks, we
discover variations in how different language models navigate these failure
modes. We find, for example, that o4-mini deploys a wider variety of strategies
to circumvent captcha resolution than other models and DeepSeek-R1 consistently
misleads users about captcha resolution. Our findings surface both the
diversity and brittleness of current web agents. More broadly, our benchmarking
methodology provides an approach to evaluating and understanding web agent
failure modes at scale.

TL;DR: ShotBench是电影摄影理解任务的综合基准，但存在选项设计模糊和评估可靠性问题。作者通过重构选项、分析ShotVL推理行为并引入扩展评估协议，提出了RefineShot基准以实现更可靠的评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ShotBench基准中的模糊选项设计和ShotVL模型在推理一致性和指令遵循方面的不足，削弱了评估的可靠性，限制了公平比较和未来进展。

Method: 通过一致的选项重构系统性地改进ShotBench，首次对ShotVL的推理行为进行批判性分析，并引入联合评估任务准确性和核心模型能力的扩展评估协议。

Result: 开发了RefineShot基准，这是一个经过改进和扩展的基准，能够实现更可靠的评估，并促进电影摄影理解的未来发展。

Conclusion: RefineShot基准解决了ShotBench的局限性，为电影摄影理解任务提供了更可靠和全面的评估框架，有助于推动该领域的进步。

Abstract: Cinematography understanding refers to the ability to recognize not only the
visual content of a scene but also the cinematic techniques that shape
narrative meaning. This capability is attracting increasing attention, as it
enhances multimodal understanding in real-world applications and underpins
coherent content creation in film and media. As the most comprehensive
benchmark for this task, ShotBench spans a wide range of cinematic concepts and
VQA-style evaluations, with ShotVL achieving state-of-the-art results on it.
However, our analysis reveals that ambiguous option design in ShotBench and
ShotVL's shortcomings in reasoning consistency and instruction adherence
undermine evaluation reliability, limiting fair comparison and hindering future
progress. To overcome these issues, we systematically refine ShotBench through
consistent option restructuring, conduct the first critical analysis of
ShotVL's reasoning behavior, and introduce an extended evaluation protocol that
jointly assesses task accuracy and core model competencies. These efforts lead
to RefineShot, a refined and expanded benchmark that enables more reliable
assessment and fosters future advances in cinematography understanding.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于分布无关风险控制的方法，通过动态提前退出机制来防御恶意上下文示例对LLM性能的负面影响，同时保持对有益示例的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs能够从少量上下文示例中学习新任务，但这种灵活性带来了安全隐患：恶意或错误的示例可能影响模型行为，需要内置防御机制来保护模型性能。

Method: 定义零样本性能作为安全基线，应用分布无关风险控制，通过动态提前退出预测机制，忽略关注不安全输入的后层注意力头。

Result: 理论分析和实证结果表明，该方法能有效控制有害上下文示例的风险，同时在有益示例上实现显著的计算效率提升。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够在不牺牲有益示例性能增益的前提下，为LLM提供针对恶意上下文示例的有效防护机制。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate a remarkable ability to learn new
tasks from a few in-context examples. However, this flexibility introduces
safety concerns: LLMs can be influenced by incorrect or malicious
demonstrations -- for example, if an adversary tampers with or injects harmful
examples without a human supervisor noticing. This motivates principled designs
in which the system itself includes built-in mechanisms to guard against such
attacks. We propose a novel approach to limit the degree to which harmful
demonstrations can degrade model performance. First, we define a baseline
``safe'' behavior for the model -- the model's performance given no in-context
demonstrations (zero-shot). Next, we apply distribution-free risk control
(DFRC) to control the extent to which in-context samples can decay performance
below zero-shot. We achieve this by leveraging dynamic early exit prediction,
ignoring later attention heads that attend the most to the unsafe inputs.
Finally, we propose modifications to DFRC that allow it to both control risk
for harmful inputs \textit{and} leverage performance and efficiency gains on
helpful inputs. We present both theoretical and empirical results showing that
our approach can effectively control risk for harmful in-context demonstrations
while simultaneously achieving substantial computational efficiency gains with
helpful demonstrations.

TL;DR: 研究发现大型多模态模型中的一小部分注意力头负责空间关系表示，这些注意力头的激活（称为功能向量）可以被提取和操作来改变模型在关系任务上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型多模态模型展现出令人印象深刻的上下文学习能力，但其支持任务学习的内部机制仍然不透明。

Method: 应用因果中介分析识别影响关系预测的注意力头，提取多模态功能向量，并在保持LMM参数冻结的情况下用少量训练数据微调这些向量。

Result: 提取的功能向量在推理时提高了零样本准确率，微调后显著优于上下文学习基线，并能线性组合解决涉及未训练空间关系的类比问题。

Conclusion: LMMs在局部内部结构中编码空间关系知识，这些知识可以被系统提取和优化，从而增进对模型模块化的理解并增强对LMMs中关系推理的控制。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) demonstrate impressive in-context learning
abilities from limited multimodal demonstrations, yet the internal mechanisms
supporting such task learning remain opaque. Building on prior work of large
language models, we show that a small subset of attention heads in the
vision-language model OpenFlamingo-4B is responsible for transmitting
representations of spatial relations. The activations of these attention heads,
termed function vectors, can be extracted and manipulated to alter an LMM's
performance on relational tasks. First, using both synthetic and real image
datasets, we apply causal mediation analysis to identify attention heads that
strongly influence relational predictions, and extract multimodal function
vectors that improve zero-shot accuracy at inference time. We further
demonstrate that these multimodal function vectors can be fine-tuned with a
modest amount of training data, while keeping LMM parameters frozen, to
significantly outperform in-context learning baselines. Finally, we show that
relation-specific function vectors can be linearly combined to solve analogy
problems involving novel and untrained spatial relations, highlighting the
strong generalization ability of this approach. Our results show that LMMs
encode spatial relational knowledge within localized internal structures, which
can be systematically extracted and optimized, thereby advancing our
understanding of model modularity and enhancing control over relational
reasoning in LMMs.

Abstract: While agentic AI has advanced in automating individual tasks, managing
complex multi-agent workflows remains a challenging problem. This paper
presents a research vision for autonomous agentic systems that orchestrate
collaboration within dynamic human-AI teams. We propose the Autonomous Manager
Agent as a core challenge: an agent that decomposes complex goals into task
graphs, allocates tasks to human and AI workers, monitors progress, adapts to
changing conditions, and maintains transparent stakeholder communication. We
formalize workflow management as a Partially Observable Stochastic Game and
identify four foundational challenges: (1) compositional reasoning for
hierarchical decomposition, (2) multi-objective optimization under shifting
preferences, (3) coordination and planning in ad hoc teams, and (4) governance
and compliance by design. To advance this agenda, we release MA-Gym, an
open-source simulation and evaluation framework for multi-agent workflow
orchestration. Evaluating GPT-5-based Manager Agents across 20 workflows, we
find they struggle to jointly optimize for goal completion, constraint
adherence, and workflow runtime - underscoring workflow management as a
difficult open problem. We conclude with organizational and ethical
implications of autonomous management systems.

Abstract: Agentic systems enable the intelligent use of research tooling, augmenting a
researcher's ability to investigate and propose novel solutions to existing
problems. Within Additive Manufacturing (AM), alloy discovery remains a complex
challenge, often requiring expertise in the various domains of materials
science, thermodynamic simulations, and experimental analysis. Large Language
Model (LLM) enabled agents can facilitate this endeavor by utilizing their
extensive knowledge base to dispatch tool calls via Model Context Protocol
(MCP) to perform actions such as Thermo-Calc property diagram calculations and
lack of fusion process map generation. In addition, the multi-agent system
developed in this work is able to effectively reason through complex user
prompts and provide analysis on the printability of proposed alloys. These
agents can dynamically adjust their task trajectory to the outcomes of tool
call results, effectively enabling autonomous decision-making in practical
environments. This work aims to utilize LLM enabled agents to automate and
accelerate the task of alloy discovery within the field of additive
manufacturing and showcase the benefits of adopting this multi-agent system.

Conclusion: 本文为CSPP提供了多RL方法的基准测试和可复用的Gym环境，为未来海运物流研究和实际部署奠定了基础。

Abstract: Container stowage planning (CSPP) is a critical component of maritime
transportation and terminal operations, directly affecting supply chain
efficiency. Owing to its complexity, CSPP has traditionally relied on human
expertise. While reinforcement learning (RL) has recently been applied to CSPP,
systematic benchmark comparisons across different algorithms remain limited. To
address this gap, we develop a Gym environment that captures the fundamental
features of CSPP and extend it to include crane scheduling in both multi-agent
and single-agent formulations. Within this framework, we evaluate five RL
algorithms: DQN, QR-DQN, A2C, PPO, and TRPO under multiple scenarios of varying
complexity. The results reveal distinct performance gaps with increasing
complexity, underscoring the importance of algorithm choice and problem
formulation for CSPP. Overall, this paper benchmarks multiple RL methods for
CSPP while providing a reusable Gym environment with crane scheduling, thus
offering a foundation for future research and practical deployment in maritime
logistics.

Abstract: The integration of electric vehicles (EVs) into smart grids presents unique
opportunities to enhance both transportation systems and energy networks.
However, ensuring safe and interpretable interactions between drivers,
vehicles, and the surrounding environment remains a critical challenge. This
paper presents a multi-modal large language model (LLM)-based framework to
process multimodal sensor data - such as object detection, semantic
segmentation, and vehicular telemetry - and generate natural-language alerts
for drivers. The framework is validated using real-world data collected from
instrumented vehicles driving on urban roads, ensuring its applicability to
real-world scenarios. By combining visual perception (YOLOv8), geocoded
positioning, and CAN bus telemetry, the framework bridges raw sensor data and
driver comprehension, enabling safer and more informed decision-making in urban
driving scenarios. Case studies using real data demonstrate the framework's
effectiveness in generating context-aware alerts for critical situations, such
as proximity to pedestrians, cyclists, and other vehicles. This paper
highlights the potential of LLMs as assistive tools in e-mobility, benefiting
both transportation systems and electric networks by enabling scalable fleet
coordination, EV load forecasting, and traffic-aware energy planning.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了基础模型在多模态联合推理中的表现，特别是在跨模态冲突场景下。研究发现模型在单模态中能识别90%的冲突，但在跨模态场景下识别率降至3%，主要原因是跨模态注意力不平衡。

Motivation: 研究基础模型在现实任务中处理多模态数据时的联合推理能力，特别是当不同模态之间存在交互和冲突时模型的表现。

Method: 通过创建跨模态冲突场景来测试模型，分析注意力机制的不平衡问题，并提出通过显式组合多模态训练数据的方法来改善注意力分布。

Result: 实验显示模型在跨模态冲突识别上表现很差（仅3%），存在严重的注意力不对称问题。提出的简单方法能显著减少注意力不平衡，并提升下游任务性能。

Conclusion: 系统性地解决跨模态上下文对于构建可靠的基础模型至关重要，需要专门设计训练数据来促进跨模态推理能力。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) deployed in real-world tasks such as computer-use
agents must integrate diverse modalities. How good are FMs at performing joint
reasoning, simultaneously reasoning over multiple modalities, especially when
the modalities interact and relate to each other to form cross-modal context?
To better understand this problem, we study FMs on cross-modal conflicts:
scenarios where conflicting evidence is presented across modalities. This
allows us to examine whether FMs prioritize one modality over another or reason
jointly to reconcile the conflict. Our experiments reveal that FMs can
recognize conflicts in unimodal contexts, composed of a single modality, 90% of
the time, but the ratio falls as low as 3% when evidence is split across
modalities -- similar observations hold in cross-lingual contexts, composed of
multiple languages. We trace this failure to cross-modal attention imbalance,
showing that FMs exhibit extreme asymmetry in attention scores,
disproportionately prioritizing certain modalities. We show that cross-modal
attention imbalance does not go away by simply scaling up multimodal or
multilingual datasets blindly, since they lack training examples that
explicitly require cross-modal reasoning. We demonstrate that even a simple and
scalable method of explicitly combining multiple modalities within each
training instance significantly reduces attention imbalance. Reduced attention
imbalance directly translates to improved downstream performance on several
vision-language benchmarks. Our findings underscore the importance of
systematically addressing cross-modal contexts to build reliable foundation
models.

TL;DR: 研究发现测试时扩展(TTS)在样本数量K很大时会出现收益递减，不同采样温度能解决不同子集的问题。提出温度维度扩展方法，显著提升LLM推理性能，使基础模型达到接近RL训练模型的水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时扩展方法仅通过增加样本数量来提升推理性能，但这种方法在大K值时会出现收益递减，且某些难题无论生成多少推理轨迹都无法解决。不同采样温度能探索模型的不同潜力区域。

Method: 提出温度维度扩展方法，在多个温度下生成推理轨迹，扩大模型的推理边界。还设计了多温度投票方法来降低温度扩展的开销。

Result: 在Qwen3系列模型和五个推理基准测试上，温度扩展比单温度TTS平均提升7.3个点。基础模型通过温度扩展能达到与RL训练模型相当的性能，无需额外后训练。

Conclusion: 测试时扩展的潜力比之前认为的更大，温度扩展提供了一种简单有效的方法来释放基础模型的潜在能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can improve reasoning at inference time through
test-time scaling (TTS), where multiple reasoning traces are generated and the
best one is selected. Prior work shows that increasing the number of samples K
steadily improves accuracy. In this paper, we demonstrate that this trend does
not hold indefinitely: at large K, further scaling yields no gains, and certain
hard questions remain unsolved regardless of the number of traces.
Interestingly, we find that different sampling temperatures solve different
subsets of problems, implying that single-temperature scaling explores only
part of a model's potential. We therefore propose scaling along the temperature
dimension, which enlarges the reasoning boundary of LLMs. Averaged over Qwen3
(0.6B, 1.7B, 4B, 8B) and five representative reasoning benchmarks (AIME
2024/2025, MATH500, LiveCodeBench, Hi-ToM), temperature scaling yields an
additional 7.3 points over single-temperature TTS. Temperature scaling also
enables base models to reach performance comparable to reinforcement learning
(RL)-trained counterparts, without additional post-training. We further provide
a comprehensive analysis of this phenomenon and design a multi-temperature
voting method that reduces the overhead of temperature scaling. Overall, our
findings suggest that TTS is more powerful than previously thought, and that
temperature scaling offers a simple and effective way to unlock the latent
potential of base models.

### [57] [A Concept of Possibility for Real-World Events](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02655)
*Daniel G. Schwartz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的可能性概念作为Zadeh(1978)标准概念的替代方案，专注于现实世界事件的可能性，通过计算前提条件成立和约束不成立的概率函数来评估事件可能性，适用于规划问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 替代Zadeh在1978年提出的标准可能性概念，专注于现实世界事件的可能性评估，特别是规划问题中的可行性分析。

Method: 将事件视为具有促成其发生的前提条件和阻碍其发生的约束条件，通过计算前提条件成立概率和约束条件不成立概率的函数来评估事件可能性。

Result: 开发了一个新的可能性理论框架，能够评估多个计划中哪个最容易或最可行完成，并提供了车辆路径规划的示例。

Conclusion: 这种可能性模型可能正确捕捉了人类关于计划的正常推理，适用于规划问题，并具有未来应用的潜力。

Abstract: This paper offers a new concept of {\it possibility} as an alternative to the
now-a-days standard concept originally introduced by L.A. Zadeh in 1978. This
new version was inspired by the original but, formally, has nothing in common
with it other than that they both adopt the {\L}ukasiewicz multivalent
interpretation of the logical connectives. Moreover, rather than seeking to
provide a general notion of possibility, this focuses specifically on the
possibility of a real-world event. An event is viewed as having prerequisites
that enable its occurrence and constraints that may impede its occurrence, and
the possibility of the event is computed as a function of the probabilities
that the prerequisites hold and the constraints do not. This version of
possibility might appropriately be applied to problems of planning. When there
are multiple plans available for achieving a goal, this theory can be used to
determine which plan is most possible, i.e., easiest or most feasible to
complete. It is speculated that this model of reasoning correctly captures
normal human reasoning about plans. The theory is elaborated and an
illustrative example for vehicle route planning is provided. There is also a
suggestion of potential future applications.

TL;DR: AutoMaAS是一个自进化的多智能体架构搜索框架，通过神经架构搜索原理自动发现最优智能体配置，在六个基准测试中实现了1.0-7.1%的性能提升，同时降低推理成本3-5%。


<details>

Motivation: 现有自动化设计方法寻求单一解决方案，无法根据查询复杂度和领域需求自适应分配资源，需要更灵活的多智能体系统设计框架。

Method: 采用神经架构搜索原则，包含四个关键创新：自动算子生成、融合和消除；动态成本感知优化；在线反馈集成；增强可解释性的决策追踪机制。

Result: 在六个基准测试中，相比最先进方法实现了1.0-7.1%的性能提升，推理成本降低3-5%，在不同数据集和LLM骨干网络上表现出优异的可迁移性。

Conclusion: AutoMaAS为大型语言模型时代的自动化多智能体系统设计建立了新范式，具有优越的适应性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems powered by large language models have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities across diverse domains, yet existing automated design
approaches seek monolithic solutions that fail to adapt resource allocation
based on query complexity and domain requirements. This paper introduces
AutoMaAS, a self-evolving multi-agent architecture search framework that
leverages neural architecture search principles to automatically discover
optimal agent configurations through dynamic operator lifecycle management and
automated machine learning techniques. Our approach incorporates four key
innovations: (1) automatic operator generation, fusion, and elimination based
on performance-cost analysis, (2) dynamic cost-aware optimization with
real-time parameter adjustment, (3) online feedback integration for continuous
architecture refinement, and (4) enhanced interpretability through decision
tracing mechanisms. Extensive experiments across six benchmarks demonstrate
that AutoMaAS achieves 1.0-7.1\% performance improvement while reducing
inference costs by 3-5\% compared to state-of-the-art methods. The framework
shows superior transferability across datasets and LLM backbones, establishing
a new paradigm for automated multi-agent system design in the era of large
language models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ARMs是一个自适应红队代理，通过推理增强的多步骤编排自动优化多样化红队策略，有效激发目标视觉语言模型的有害输出。它提出了11种新颖的多模态攻击策略，整合了17种红队算法，并在基准测试中达到了最先进的攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有红队方法要么局限于有限的对抗模式，要么严重依赖人工工程，缺乏对新兴真实世界VLM漏洞的可扩展探索。需要系统化、全面的风险评估方法来应对VLM安全漏洞的挑战。

Method: 提出ARMs自适应红队代理，采用推理增强的多步骤编排自动优化红队策略。设计了11种多模态攻击策略，通过模型上下文协议整合17种红队算法，并使用分层记忆和epsilon-greedy攻击探索算法平衡攻击多样性和有效性。

Result: 在实例和策略基准测试中，ARMs达到最先进的攻击成功率，平均超过基线52.1%，在Claude-4-Sonnet上超过90%。生成的红队实例多样性显著更高，揭示了VLM的新兴漏洞。构建了包含30K+实例的ARMs-Bench数据集。

Conclusion: ARMs提供了一种系统化的VLM安全评估方法，能够有效发现新兴漏洞。基于ARMs-Bench的安全微调显著提高了VLM的鲁棒性，同时保持其通用效用，为改进多模态安全对齐提供了可行指导。

Abstract: As vision-language models (VLMs) gain prominence, their multimodal interfaces
also introduce new safety vulnerabilities, making the safety evaluation
challenging and critical. Existing red-teaming efforts are either restricted to
a narrow set of adversarial patterns or depend heavily on manual engineering,
lacking scalable exploration of emerging real-world VLM vulnerabilities. To
bridge this gap, we propose ARMs, an adaptive red-teaming agent that
systematically conducts comprehensive risk assessments for VLMs. Given a target
harmful behavior or risk definition, ARMs automatically optimizes diverse
red-teaming strategies with reasoning-enhanced multi-step orchestration, to
effectively elicit harmful outputs from target VLMs. We propose 11 novel
multimodal attack strategies, covering diverse adversarial patterns of VLMs
(e.g., reasoning hijacking, contextual cloaking), and integrate 17 red-teaming
algorithms into ARMs via model context protocol (MCP). To balance the diversity
and effectiveness of the attack, we design a layered memory with an
epsilon-greedy attack exploration algorithm. Extensive experiments on instance-
and policy-based benchmarks show that ARMs achieves SOTA attack success rates,
exceeding baselines by an average of 52.1% and surpassing 90% on
Claude-4-Sonnet. We show that the diversity of red-teaming instances generated
by ARMs is significantly higher, revealing emerging vulnerabilities in VLMs.
Leveraging ARMs, we construct ARMs-Bench, a large-scale multimodal safety
dataset comprising over 30K red-teaming instances spanning 51 diverse risk
categories, grounded in both real-world multimodal threats and regulatory
risks. Safety fine-tuning with ARMs-Bench substantially improves the robustness
of VLMs while preserving their general utility, providing actionable guidance
to improve multimodal safety alignment against emerging threats.

Conclusion: 该约束中心架构为制造系统提供了可靠、自动化的约束规范解决方案，有效结合了LLM的生成能力和领域特定知识。

Abstract: Advanced Planning and Scheduling (APS) systems have become indispensable for
modern manufacturing operations, enabling optimized resource allocation and
production efficiency in increasingly complex and dynamic environments. While
algorithms for solving abstracted scheduling problems have been extensively
investigated, the critical prerequisite of specifying manufacturing
requirements into formal constraints remains manual and labor-intensive.
Although recent advances of generative models, particularly Large Language
Models (LLMs), show promise in automating constraint specification from
heterogeneous raw manufacturing data, their direct application faces challenges
due to natural language ambiguity, non-deterministic outputs, and limited
domain-specific knowledge. This paper presents a constraint-centric
architecture that regulates LLMs to perform reliable automated constraint
specification for production scheduling. The architecture defines a
hierarchical structural space organized across three levels, implemented
through domain-specific representation to ensure precision and reliability
while maintaining flexibility. Furthermore, an automated production scenario
adaptation algorithm is designed and deployed to efficiently customize the
architecture for specific manufacturing configurations. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed approach successfully balances the generative
capabilities of LLMs with the reliability requirements of manufacturing
systems, significantly outperforming pure LLM-based approaches in constraint
specification tasks.

TL;DR: 提出Node-wise Consistency Verification (NCV)框架，通过节点级一致性检查来验证大语言模型的多步推理，提高错误定位精度并减少token消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在验证多步推理时存在错误定位不精确和token成本高的问题，要么评估整个推理链导致注意力稀释，要么依赖昂贵的多重采样。

Method: NCV将验证重构为节点级的轻量级二进制一致性检查，将思维链分解为相互连接的验证节点，避免不必要的长文本生成。

Result: 在公共数据集上，NCV相比基线方法在F1分数上提升10%到25%，同时比传统CoT验证器减少6×到58×的token使用量。

Conclusion: NCV框架提高了可解释性和效率，为可靠的LLM推理验证提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Verifying multi-step reasoning in large language models is difficult due to
imprecise error localization and high token costs. Existing methods either
assess entire reasoning chains, suffering attention dilution, or rely on
expensive multi-sampling. We introduce Node-wise Consistency Verification
(NCV), a training-free framework that recasts verification as lightweight
binary consistency checks at the node level. By decomposing the chain of
thought into interconnected verification nodes, NCV precisely localizes errors
and avoids unnecessary long-form generation. Experiments demonstrate that our
approach enhances interpretability and efficiency, presenting a scalable
solution for reliable LLM reasoning verification. On public datasets, NCV
achieves a 10\% to 25\% improvement in F1 scores over baselines while utilizing
$6\times$~$58\times$ fewer tokens than traditional methods like CoT-based
verifiers.

TL;DR: TRACE是一个用于多维度评估工具增强LLM代理性能的框架，通过证据库机制分析推理轨迹，解决了传统仅匹配最终答案的评估局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具增强基准测试主要依赖答案匹配，无法评估代理在解决复杂请求时的推理轨迹质量，包括效率、幻觉和适应性等关键方面。

Method: 引入证据库积累推理步骤中的知识，实现多维度轨迹分析；创建包含多样化有缺陷轨迹的元评估数据集来验证框架。

Result: TRACE能够准确、可扩展且经济地评估复杂代理行为，即使使用小型开源LLM也能获得良好效果，并揭示了之前未报告的观察结果。

Conclusion: TRACE框架为工具增强LLM代理提供了全面的评估方法，超越了传统答案匹配的局限，能够有效分析推理轨迹的多个维度。

Abstract: Although recent tool-augmented benchmarks incorporate complex user requests
and diverse tools, the evaluation methods for most of them remain limited to
answer matching. However, as the number of steps required to resolve a user
request increases, a proper evaluation of an agent's performance must go beyond
the final answer to also assess the problem-solving trajectory, including
previously ignored aspects such as efficiency, hallucination, and adaptivity.
The most straightforward method for evaluating these aspects is to compare an
agent's trajectory with the ground-truth trajectory, but this approach is
fundamentally limited since annotating all valid ground-truth trajectories is
prohibitively expensive. However, a simple LLM-based evaluator struggles to
assess trajectories in detail without ground truth. To effectively evaluate the
agents in this manner, we introduce TRACE, a framework for the
multi-dimensional evaluation of tool-augmented LLM agent performance. By
incorporating an evidence bank, which accumulates knowledge gathered from
preceding reasoning steps, TRACE enables a multi-faceted analysis and
evaluation of an agent's reasoning trajectory effectively. To validate our
framework, we develop a new meta-evaluation dataset by augmenting existing
benchmarks with diverse and flawed trajectories, each labeled with
multi-faceted performance scores. Our results confirm that TRACE accurately
evaluates these complex behaviors in a scalable and cost-effective manner, even
with small open-source LLMs. Furthermore, we apply our method to evaluate the
trajectories that agents produce while solving tool-augmented tasks, presenting
previously unreported observations and their corresponding insights.

*Antoine Maier,Aude Maier,Tom David*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文挑战了机器学习中训练模型能完全满足目标函数的假设（OSA），指出在现实条件下，近似、估计和优化误差会导致系统性偏离目标，且开发者意图无法完美转化为形式化目标。基于数学结果，这些差距在强优化压力下会引发Goodhart定律失效，因此需要对通用AI系统的优化设置原则性限制以避免失控风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动机是检验机器学习中一个常见但很少被验证的假设——训练模型能完全满足其指定的目标函数（OSA）。作者认为这一假设在现实条件下会失效，因为技术误差和意图转化困难会导致系统性偏离，且这些偏离在强优化下会引发Goodhart定律失效，带来失控风险。

Method: 方法是在学习范式无关的框架中，分析OSA失效的技术原因（近似、估计和优化误差），以及意图转化为形式化目标的实际困难。基于近期数学结果，论证这些差距在强优化压力下会不可区分地导致Goodhart定律失效模式。

Result: 结果表明OSA在现实条件下确实会失效，技术误差和意图转化困难导致系统性偏离目标。这些偏离在强优化压力下会引发Goodhart定律失效，且失效点无法事先确定，因此需要对通用AI系统的优化设置原则性限制。

Conclusion: 结论是OSA假设在现实条件下不成立，技术限制和意图转化困难导致模型偏离目标。由于这些偏离在强优化下会引发Goodhart定律失效且失效点无法预测，因此必须对通用AI系统的优化设置原则性限制，否则持续优化可能导致可预测且不可逆的失控。

Abstract: A common but rarely examined assumption in machine learning is that training
yields models that actually satisfy their specified objective function. We call
this the Objective Satisfaction Assumption (OSA). Although deviations from OSA
are acknowledged, their implications are overlooked. We argue, in a
learning-paradigm-agnostic framework, that OSA fails in realistic conditions:
approximation, estimation, and optimization errors guarantee systematic
deviations from the intended objective, regardless of the quality of its
specification. Beyond these technical limitations, perfectly capturing and
translating the developer's intent, such as alignment with human preferences,
into a formal objective is practically impossible, making misspecification
inevitable. Building on recent mathematical results, absent a mathematical
characterization of these gaps, they are indistinguishable from those that
collapse into Goodhart's law failure modes under strong optimization pressure.
Because the Goodhart breaking point cannot be located ex ante, a principled
limit on the optimization of General-Purpose AI systems is necessary. Absent
such a limit, continued optimization is liable to push systems into predictable
and irreversible loss of control.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了BayesianRouter框架，通过结合离线和在线学习来动态选择奖励模型，解决单一奖励模型过拟合和冷启动问题，在多任务基准上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RLHF/RLAIF流程依赖单一奖励模型，限制了对齐质量并容易过拟合。虽然最近有研究探索奖励模型路由，但现有方法存在冷启动和探索不足的问题。

Method: 提出混合路由框架BayesianRouter：离线阶段训练多任务路由器估计每个奖励模型的可靠性；在线阶段使用贝叶斯Thompson采样进行查询级奖励模型选择，用离线嵌入作为高斯先验初始化权重向量，并通过在线奖励自适应更新后验分布。

Result: 在指令跟随（AlpacaEval-2、Arena-Hard、MT-Bench）和推理（GSM8K、MMLU）基准上的广泛实验表明，BayesianRouter始终优于单个奖励模型、奖励模型集成和现有路由方法。

Conclusion: BayesianRouter通过结合离线和在线学习，有效解决了奖励模型路由中的冷启动和探索不足问题，显著提升了语言模型对齐的效果。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human or AI feedback (RLHF / RLAIF) has become
the standard paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs). However, most
pipelines rely on a single reward model (RM), limiting alignment quality and
risking overfitting. Recent work explores RM routing--dynamically selecting an
RM from a candidate pool to exploit complementary strengths while maintaining
$O(1)$ RM calls--but existing methods suffer from cold-start and insufficient
exploration. We propose BayesianRouter, a hybrid routing framework that
combines offline RM strengths learning with online Bayesian selection. In the
offline stage, a multi-task router is trained on preference data to estimate
per-RM reliability. In the online stage, a Bayesian Thompson sampling router
performs per-query RM selection, initializing RM-specific weight vectors with
offline embeddings as Gaussian priors and adaptively updating their posteriors
with online rewards to adapt to the evolving policy distribution. Extensive
experiments on instruction-following (AlpacaEval-2, Arena-Hard, MT-Bench) and
reasoning (GSM8K, MMLU) benchmarks show that BayesianRouter consistently
outperforms individual RMs, RM ensembling, and existing routing methods.

Motivation: 离散扩散模型的非自回归特性使得重要性采样难以处理，rollout过程复杂，导致如GRPO等强化学习方法难以应用。

Method: 首先建立DDM的理论基础，构建能捕捉重要token波动的重要性估计器；然后为视觉序列精心设计rollout方法，产生多样化的补全结果和可靠的优化梯度。

Result: MaskGRPO带来更稳定高效的更新，在数学推理、编程和视觉生成基准测试中实现了更强的推理性能和更好的生成质量。

Conclusion: 本研究确立了MaskGRPO作为系统化的策略优化方法，是离散化视觉扩散的首个实用途径。

Abstract: Optimizing discrete diffusion model (DDM) with rewards remains a challenge:
the non-autoregressive paradigm makes importance sampling intractable and
rollout complex, puzzling reinforcement learning methods such as Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO). In this study, we introduce MaskGRPO, the first
viable approach to enable scalable multimodal reinforcement learning in
discrete diffusion with effective importance sampling and modality-specific
adaptations. To this end, we first clarify the theoretical foundation for DDMs,
which facilitates building an importance estimator that captures valuable token
fluctuation for gradient updates. We then delicately tailored the rollout
method for visual sequences, which yields diverse completions and reliable
optimization gradients. Upon math reasoning, coding, and visual generation
benchmarks, MaskGRPO brings more stable and efficient updates, leading to
stronger reasoning performance and better generation quality. This study
establishes MaskGRPO as a systematic policy optimization approach and the first
practical way for discretized visual diffusion.

Motivation: 当前主流的深度学习方法是黑盒系统，缺乏对其推理过程的解释，这限制了其可信度和采用。可解释AI方法旨在通过提供模型决策过程的解释来克服这一挑战，但这些方法通常由具有技术背景的研究人员开发，融入了他们对不同解释机制存在性、有效性和解释效用的假设。

Method: 研究可解释AI方法应用于AI系统时的本体论和认识论假设，即我们对解释存在性以及获取这些解释知识的能力所做的假设。分析XAI方法中看似微小的技术变化如何对应于解释基础假设的重要差异。

Result: 分析表明，忽略底层本体-认识论范式在选择XAI方法时存在风险，不同的XAI方法基于不同的解释概念假设，这些假设对解释的有效性和解释具有重要影响。

Conclusion: 需要根据具体应用领域选择和调整合适的XAI方法，考虑不同方法所基于的本体论和认识论假设，以确保解释的有效性和适用性。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is being applied in almost every field. At the
same time, the currently dominant deep learning methods are fundamentally
black-box systems that lack explanations for their inferences, significantly
limiting their trustworthiness and adoption. Explainable AI (XAI) methods aim
to overcome this challenge by providing explanations of the models' decision
process. Such methods are often proposed and developed by engineers and
scientists with a predominantly technical background and incorporate their
assumptions about the existence, validity, and explanatory utility of different
conceivable explanatory mechanisms. However, the basic concept of an
explanation -- what it is, whether we can know it, whether it is absolute or
relative -- is far from trivial and has been the subject of deep philosophical
debate for millennia. As we point out here, the assumptions incorporated into
different XAI methods are not harmless and have important consequences for the
validity and interpretation of AI explanations in different domains. We
investigate ontological and epistemological assumptions in explainability
methods when they are applied to AI systems, meaning the assumptions we make
about the existence of explanations and our ability to gain knowledge about
those explanations. Our analysis shows how seemingly small technical changes to
an XAI method may correspond to important differences in the underlying
assumptions about explanations. We furthermore highlight the risks of ignoring
the underlying onto-epistemological paradigm when choosing an XAI method for a
given application, and we discuss how to select and adapt appropriate XAI
methods for different domains of application.

Motivation: 在基于规则的智能环境中，虽然反事实解释是XAI中的强大工具，但该领域缺乏生成此类解释的成熟方法。

Method: 开发了首个针对该领域的反事实解释形式化和实现，作为现有智能环境解释引擎的插件扩展，并通过用户研究(N=17)评估效果。

Result: 用户偏好具有高度情境依赖性：因果解释因语言简洁和在时间压力下更受青睐，而反事实解释因其可操作性内容在解决问题时更受欢迎。

Conclusion: 为智能环境提供了一种新型解释的实用框架，并提供了经验证据来指导何时选择每种解释类型最有效。

Abstract: Explainability is increasingly seen as an essential feature of rule-based
smart environments. While counterfactual explanations, which describe what
could have been done differently to achieve a desired outcome, are a powerful
tool in eXplainable AI (XAI), no established methods exist for generating them
in these rule-based domains. In this paper, we present the first formalization
and implementation of counterfactual explanations tailored to this domain. It
is implemented as a plugin that extends an existing explanation engine for
smart environments. We conducted a user study (N=17) to evaluate our generated
counterfactuals against traditional causal explanations. The results show that
user preference is highly contextual: causal explanations are favored for their
linguistic simplicity and in time-pressured situations, while counterfactuals
are preferred for their actionable content, particularly when a user wants to
resolve a problem. Our work contributes a practical framework for a new type of
explanation in smart environments and provides empirical evidence to guide the
choice of when each explanation type is most effective.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探究AI系统在Raven渐进矩阵任务中的表现是否反映了真正的推理能力，还是仅仅依赖统计捷径，特别是在不完整训练条件下评估其泛化能力。

Method: 在Impartial-RAVEN数据集上，故意在训练中省略多个结构规则，评估序列到序列transformer模型和基于视觉的架构（如CoPINet和双对比网络）的表现。

Result: 实验结果显示，transformer模型在熟悉规则上表现良好，但在面对新颖或省略规则时准确率急剧下降；token级准确率与完整答案准确率之间的差距凸显了当前方法的局限性。

Conclusion: 这些发现为深度学习模型的推理机制提供了新见解，强调了需要超越模式识别、实现鲁棒抽象推理的架构设计。

Abstract: Analogical reasoning lies at the core of human cognition and remains a
fundamental challenge for artificial intelligence. Raven's Progressive Matrices
(RPM) serve as a widely used benchmark to assess abstract reasoning by
requiring the inference of underlying structural rules. While many vision-based
and language-based models have achieved success on RPM tasks, it remains
unclear whether their performance reflects genuine reasoning ability or
reliance on statistical shortcuts. This study investigates the generalization
capacity of modern AI systems under conditions of incomplete training by
deliberately omitting several structural rules during training. Both
sequence-to-sequence transformer models and vision-based architectures such as
CoPINet and the Dual-Contrast Network are evaluated on the Impartial-RAVEN
(I-RAVEN) dataset. Experiments reveal that although transformers demonstrate
strong performance on familiar rules, their accuracy declines sharply when
faced with novel or omitted rules. Moreover, the gap between token-level
accuracy and complete answer accuracy highlights fundamental limitations in
current approaches. These findings provide new insights into the reasoning
mechanisms underlying deep learning models and underscore the need for
architectures that move beyond pattern recognition toward robust abstract
reasoning.

agents. This paper explores different prompting methods and evaluates their
effectiveness in enhancing agent collaborative behaviour and decision-making.
We enhance CoELA, a framework designed for building Collaborative Embodied
Agents that leverage LLMs for multi-agent communication, reasoning, and task
coordination in shared virtual spaces. Through systematic experimentation, we
examine different LLMs and prompt engineering strategies to identify optimised
combinations that maximise collaboration performance. Furthermore, we extend
our research by integrating speech capabilities, enabling seamless
collaborative voice-based interactions. Our findings highlight the
effectiveness of prompt optimisation in enhancing collaborative agent
performance; for example, our best combination improved the efficiency of the
system running with Gemma3 by 22% compared to the original CoELA system. In
addition, the speech integration provides a more engaging user interface for
iterative system development and demonstrations.

Abstract: Deep research has revolutionized data analysis, yet data scientists still
devote substantial time to manually crafting visualizations, highlighting the
need for robust automation from natural language queries. However, current
systems struggle with complex datasets containing multiple files and iterative
refinement. Existing approaches, including simple single- or multi-agent
systems, often oversimplify the task, focusing on initial query parsing while
failing to robustly manage data complexity, code errors, or final visualization
quality. In this paper, we reframe this challenge as a collaborative
multi-agent problem. We introduce CoDA, a multi-agent system that employs
specialized LLM agents for metadata analysis, task planning, code generation,
and self-reflection. We formalize this pipeline, demonstrating how
metadata-focused analysis bypasses token limits and quality-driven refinement
ensures robustness. Extensive evaluations show CoDA achieves substantial gains
in the overall score, outperforming competitive baselines by up to 41.5%. This
work demonstrates that the future of visualization automation lies not in
isolated code generation but in integrated, collaborative agentic workflows.

Abstract: Diffusion language models, especially masked discrete diffusion models, have
achieved great success recently. While there are some theoretical and primary
empirical results showing the advantages of latent reasoning with looped
transformers or continuous chain-of-thoughts, continuous diffusion models
typically underperform their discrete counterparts. In this paper, we argue
that diffusion language models do not necessarily need to be in the discrete
space. In particular, we prove that continuous diffusion models have stronger
expressivity than discrete diffusions and looped transformers. We attribute the
contradiction between the theoretical expressiveness and empirical performance
to their practical trainability: while continuous diffusion provides
intermediate supervision that looped transformers lack, they introduce
additional difficulty decoding tokens into the discrete token space from the
continuous representation space. We therefore propose Coevolutionary Continuous
Discrete Diffusion (CCDD), which defines a joint multimodal diffusion process
on the union of a continuous representation space and a discrete token space,
leveraging a single model to simultaneously denoise in the joint space. By
combining two modalities, CCDD is expressive with rich semantics in the latent
space, as well as good trainability and sample quality with the help of
explicit discrete tokens. We also propose effective architectures and advanced
training/sampling techniques for CCDD, which reveals strong empirical
performance in extensive language modeling experiments on real-world tasks.

Abstract: Infected individuals in some epidemics can remain asymptomatic while still
carrying and transmitting the infection. These individuals contribute to the
spread of the epidemic and pose a significant challenge to public health
policies. Identifying asymptomatic individuals is critical for measuring and
controlling an epidemic, but periodic and widespread testing of healthy
individuals is often too costly. This work tackles the problem of identifying
asymptomatic individuals considering a classic SI (Susceptible-Infected)
network epidemic model where a fraction of the infected nodes are not observed
as infected (i.e., their observed state is identical to susceptible nodes). In
order to classify healthy nodes as asymptomatic or susceptible, a Graph Neural
Network (GNN) model with supervised learning is adopted where a set of node
features are built from the network with observed infected nodes. The approach
is evaluated across different network models, network sizes, and fraction of
observed infections. Results indicate that the proposed methodology is robust
across different scenarios, accurately identifying asymptomatic nodes while
also generalizing to different network sizes and fraction of observed
infections.

Abstract: Distributed optimization finds applications in large-scale machine learning,
data processing and classification over multi-agent networks. In real-world
scenarios, the communication network of agents may encounter latency that may
affect the convergence of the optimization protocol. This paper addresses the
case where the information exchange among the agents (computing nodes) over
data-transmission channels (links) might be subject to communication
time-delays, which is not well addressed in the existing literature. Our
proposed algorithm improves the state-of-the-art by handling heterogeneous and
arbitrary but bounded and fixed (time-invariant) delays over general
strongly-connected directed networks. Arguments from matrix theory, algebraic
graph theory, and augmented consensus formulation are applied to prove the
convergence to the optimal value. Simulations are provided to verify the
results and compare the performance with some existing delay-free algorithms.

Abstract: We develop an end-to-end deep learning framework for downlink beamforming in
large-scale sparse MIMO channels. The core is a deep EDN architecture with
three modules: (i) an encoder NN, deployed at each user end, that compresses
estimated downlink channels into low-dimensional latent vectors. The latent
vector from each user is compressed and then fed back to the BS. (ii) a
beamformer decoder NN at the BS that maps recovered latent vectors to
beamformers, and (iii) a channel decoder NN at the BS that reconstructs
downlink channels from recovered latent vectors to further refine the
beamformers. The training of EDN leverages two key strategies: (a)
semi-amortized learning, where the beamformer decoder NN contains an analytical
gradient ascent during both training and inference stages, and (b) knowledge
distillation, where the loss function consists of a supervised term and an
unsupervised term, and starting from supervised training with MMSE beamformers,
over the epochs, the model training gradually shifts toward unsupervised using
the sum-rate objective. The proposed EDN beamforming framework is extended to
both far-field and near-field hybrid beamforming scenarios. Extensive
simulations validate its effectiveness under diverse network and channel
conditions.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) have
unlocked new potential for addressing the dual demands of high-resolution
positioning and reliable communication in 6G Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X)
networks. These capabilities are vital for transmitting safety-critical data
from Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) to improve metrics such as Time to
Collision (TTC) and reduce the Collision Risk (CR) ratio. However, limited
radio resources and interference remain major obstacles to achieving both
precision and capacity simultaneously. The challenge intensifies in
mixedtraffic scenarios involving Human-Driven Vehicles (HDVs), which lack
connectivity and cannot share their status or positioning. Additionally, CAV
sensors are limited in range and accuracy, making detection of HDVs unreliable.
ISAC plays a pivotal role here by enabling the sensing of HDV positions via
shared communication infrastructure, improving environmental awareness. To
address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel Value of Information
(VoI) metric that prioritizes the transmission of safety-critical data. The
joint sensing-communication-control problem is modeled as a two-time-scale
sequential decision process and solved using a Multi-Agent Distributed
Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) algorithm. By focusing on high- VoI
data, the framework reduces complexity and optimizes network and traffic
resource usage. Simulations show that the proposed approach significantly
reduces the CR ratio by at least 33% and improves the TTC by up to 66%,
demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing safety and efficiency in
mixedautonomy environments.

Conclusion: 控制器与动力系统的耦合方式影响系统脆弱性，研究结果为混合自动驾驶交通中的攻击检测和缓解提供了量化指导。

Abstract: Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) is rapidly proliferating across electric
vehicles (EVs) and internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, enhancing traffic
flow while simultaneously expanding the attack surface for communication-based
cyberattacks. Because the two powertrains translate control inputs into motion
differently, their cyber-resilience remains unquantified. Therefore, we
formalize six novel message-level attack vectors and implement them in a
ring-road simulation that systematically varies the ACC market penetration
rates (MPRs) and the spatial pattern of compromised vehicles. A three-tier risk
taxonomy converts disturbance metrics into actionable defense priorities for
practitioners. Across all simulation scenarios, EV platoons exhibit lower
velocity standard deviation, reduced spacing oscillations, and faster
post-attack recovery compared to ICE counterparts, revealing an inherent
stability advantage. These findings clarify how controller-to-powertrain
coupling influences vulnerability and offer quantitative guidance for the
detection and mitigation of attacks in mixed automated traffic.

Abstract: Vacuum disc filtration is critical in pulp mills for white liquor
clarification and pulp washing, involving tightly coupled dynamics between
rotational speed, vacuum pressure, slurry concentration, filtrate flow, and
cake thickness. These nonlinear interactions are often regulated using
empirical methods, lacking formal modeling and control. This article develops a
dynamic, multivariable model of a continuous-disc filter (CD-filter) system
based on first principles, simplified to a single representative disc for
tractability. A linearized state-space model supports the design of two control
strategies: a decentralized PI-based scheme and a centralized model predictive
control (MPC). MATLAB-Simulink simulations reveal that MPC outperforms PI in
tracking accuracy, overshoot reduction, and disturbance rejection. A 3D
efficiency surface illustrates the importance of coordinating inlet flow and
solids concentration. Results highlight the need for advanced multivariable
control in optimizing CD-filter performance.

Abstract: Extreme weather frequently cause widespread outages in distribution systems
(DSs), demonstrating the importance of hardening strategies for resilience
enhancement. However, the well-utilization of real-world outage data with
associated weather conditions to make informed hardening decisions in DSs is
still an open issue. To bridge this research gap, this paper proposes a
data-driven stochastic distribution line (DL) hardening strategy. First, a deep
neural network (DNN) regression model is developed to predict the probabilistic
evolution of outage scenarios under various hardening decisions. Based on the
DNN predictions, the problem is formulated as a decision-dependent
distributionally robust optimization (DRO) model, accounting for uncertainties
in outage scenario distributions using a data-driven ambiguity set. To address
decision-dependent uncertainty, a Bayesian online learning algorithm is
proposed. This algorithm decomposes the original problem into inner and outer
problems. Then, it iteratively refines hardening decisions by sequentially
incorporating outage data and dynamically updating decision-specific ambiguity
sets by using Bayes' theorem and Bayesian Inference. Also, the convergence of
the algorithm is proven through dynamic regret analysis. Finally, case studies
are implemented on a real-world DS in Redfield, Iowa, USA. A dataset spanning
24 years (2001-2024) is constructed based on the utility outage records. The
simulation results validates the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.

TL;DR: 提出了一种情境感知的多层级负荷恢复框架，通过混合整数线性规划和滚动时域优化解决电力配电网中跨层级负荷转移的复杂恢复问题。


<details>

Motivation: 现有配电网恢复研究主要关注相邻馈线间的负荷转移，但在实践中当相邻馈线容量不足时，需要从更远距离的馈线获取支持。这种分层恢复过程复杂，特别是涉及冷负荷启动和用户侧分布式能源延迟重连等变化系统条件时。

Abstract: Restoration in power distribution systems (PDSs) is well studied, however,
most existing research focuses on network partition and microgrid formation,
where load transfer is limited to adjacent feeders. This focus is not
practical, as when adjacent feeders lack sufficient capacity, utilities may
request support from more distant feeders in practice. Such a hirarchical
restoration is complex, especially when involving changing system conditions
due to cold load pickup and delayed reconnection of behind-the-meter DERs. To
fill this research gap, a situationally aware multi-tier load restoration
framework is proposed. Specifically, models are proposed to describe the
multi-tier load restoration, including the multi-tier load transfer and
substation transformer and feeder protection models. By introducing binary
actional switching variables and load block transfer variables, the models
effectively captures the dynamics of switches and multi-tier transfer process.
To integrate situational awareness of evolving system conditions, the problem
is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) and then embedded within
a rolling horizon optimization. Particularly, a set of safeguarded constraints
are developed based on segment-level restoration reward bounds to mitigate the
myopia of traditional rolling horizon optimization. The proposed safeguarded
rolling strategy guarantees that each time step is lower bounded by a
$(1-\varepsilon)$-fraction of its optimal restoration potential, thereby
balancing short-term switching decisions with long-term restoration goals.
Finally, cases studies on the modified IEEE 123-node test feeder validate the
proposed multi-tier restoration framework.

Abstract: Cyberattacks on pipeline operational technology systems pose growing risks to
energy infrastructure. This study develops a physics-informed simulation and
optimization framework for analyzing cyber-physical threats in petroleum
pipeline networks. The model integrates networked hydraulic dynamics,
SCADA-based state estimation, model predictive control (MPC), and a bi-level
formulation for stealthy false-data injection (FDI) attacks. Pipeline flow and
pressure dynamics are modeled on a directed graph using nodal pressure
evolution and edge-based Weymouth-type relations, including control-aware
equipment such as valves and compressors. An extended Kalman filter estimates
the full network state from partial SCADA telemetry. The controller computes
pressure-safe control inputs via MPC under actuator constraints and forecasted
demands. Adversarial manipulation is formalized as a bi-level optimization
problem where an attacker perturbs sensor data to degrade throughput while
remaining undetected by bad-data detectors. This attack-control interaction is
solved via Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) reformulation, which results in a tractable
mixed-integer quadratic program. Test gas pipeline case studies demonstrate the
covert reduction of service delivery under attack. Results show that
undetectable attacks can cause sustained throughput loss with minimal
instantaneous deviation. This reveals the need for integrated detection and
control strategies in cyber-physical infrastructure.

Abstract: This paper presents a synthesis approach aiming to guarantee a minimum
upper-bound for the time taken to reach a target set of non-zero measure that
encompasses the origin, while taking into account uncertainties and input and
state constraints. This approach is based on a harmonic transformation of the
Lyapunov function and a novel piecewise quadratic representation of this
transformed Lyapunov function over a simplicial partition of the state space.
The problem is solved in a policy iteration fashion, whereas the evaluation and
improvement steps are formulated as linear matrix inequalities employing the
structural relaxation approach. Though initially formulated for uncertain
polytopic systems, extensions to piecewise and nonlinear systems are discussed.
Three examples illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in
different scenarios.

Abstract: This paper considers the problem of adapting a predesigned policy,
represented by a parameterized function class, from a solution that minimizes a
given original cost function to a trade-off solution between minimizing the
original objective and an additional cost function. The problem is formulated
as a constrained optimization problem, where deviations from the optimal value
of the original cost are explicitly constrained. To solve it, we develop a
closed-loop system that governs the evolution of the policy parameters, with a
closed-loop controller designed to adjust the additional cost gradient to
ensure the satisfaction of the constraint. The resulting closed-loop system,
termed control-barrier-function-based policy adaptation, exploits the
set-invariance property of control barrier functions to guarantee constraint
satisfaction. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through
numerical experiments on the Cartpole and Lunar Lander benchmarks from OpenAI
Gym, as well as a quadruped robot, thereby illustrating both its practicality
and potential for real-world policy adaptation.

Abstract: This article proposes a periodic event-triggered adaptive barrier control
policy for the trajectory tracking problem of perturbed Euler-Lagrangian
systems with state, input, and temporal (SIT) constraints. In particular, an
approximation-free adaptive-barrier control architecture is designed to ensure
prescribed-time convergence of the tracking error to a prescribed bound while
rejecting exogenous disturbances. In contrast to existing approaches that
necessitate continuous real-time control action, the proposed controller
generates event-based updates through periodic evaluation of the triggering
condition. Additionally, we derive an upper bound on the monitoring period by
analysing the performance degradation of the filtered tracking error to
facilitate periodic evaluation of the event-triggered strategy. To this end, a
time-varying threshold function is considered in the triggering mechanism to
reduce the number of triggers during the transient phase of system behaviour.
Notably, the proposed design avoids Zeno behaviour and precludes the need for
continuous monitoring of the triggering condition. A simulation and
experimental study is undertaken to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed
control scheme.

Abstract: This paper goes one step forward in the life estimation of HVDC cable
insulation under load cycles by introducing for the first time a microscopic
model of charge conduction and transport i.e., Bipolar Charge Transport BCT
model for electric field calculation inside the insulation thickness. The paper
firstly includes the development and the validation of BCT model with that
found in literature. Then, the parameters of the developed BCT model are
optimized using Pulsed Electro-Acoustic PEA space charge measurements. Followed
by the integration of the developed, validated and optimized model into the
electric field calculation for life estimation of a 500 kV DC-XLPE insulated
cable subjected to Type Test load cycles according to Cigre Techical Brochure
852. The developed microscopic model is compared to the macroscopic models
already found in the literature. The microscopic model shows a comparable
electric field inversion similarly to macroscopic models. However, the behavior
of the microscopic model is noticed to be different under heating and cooling
load cycles. In hot cable, the maximum electric field stabilizes at different
amplitude and position inside the insulation thickness in both models. This
investigation has been carried out in the framework of the HEU-NEWGEN research
project.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful framework for
sequential decision-making in dynamic environments, particularly when system
parameters are unknown. This paper investigates RL-based control for
entropy-regularized Linear Quadratic control (LQC) problems with multiplicative
noises over an infinite time horizon. First, we adapt the Regularized Policy
Gradient (RPG) algorithm to stochastic optimal control settings, proving that
despite the non-convexity of the problem, RPG converges globally under
conditions of gradient domination and near-smoothness. Second, based on
zero-order optimization approach, we introduce a novel model free RL algorithm:
Sample-Based Regularized Policy Gradient (SB-RPG). SB-RPG operates without
knowledge of system parameters yet still retains strong theoretical guarantees
of global convergence. Our model leverages entropy regularization to accelerate
convergence and address the exploration versus exploitation trade-off inherent
in RL. Numerical simulations validate the theoretical results and demonstrate
the efficacy of SB-RPG in unknown-parameters environments.

Conclusion: 不完全空气混合会显著降低HVAC虚拟电池效率，但通过基于风扇功率的闭环控制可以显著改善性能，无需测量空气混合参数。

Abstract: Commercial building Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems
can provide flexibility to the electricity grid. Some researchers have found it
convenient to model HVAC systems as virtual batteries. These models also better
align with models used by grid planners and operators. However, experiments
have shown that HVAC load shifting can be inefficient, and virtual battery
models do not capture this inefficiency well. While the models typically use
the average room temperature as the system's ``state of charge," they do not
capture other factors that affect HVAC power/energy such as airflow and mixing.
Here, we develop a new analytical building model to explore how incomplete
mixing of supply air into a conditioned space leads to inefficiency in a
virtual battery capturing the dynamics of HVAC fan power load shifting. The
model qualitatively matches experimental results better than previous models,
and shows that, as mixing becomes worse, the virtual battery becomes less
efficient. Unfortunately, air mixing is unmeasured/unmeasurable. However, we
show that, by closing the loop around measurements of fan power, we can improve
the virtual battery's performance without the need for air mixing measurements.
For example, in one case, we show a roundtrip efficiency improvement from 0.75
to 0.99.

Abstract: Peer-to-peer energy trading offers a promising solution for enhancing
renewable energy utilization and economic benefits within interconnected
microgrids. However, existing real-time P2P markets face two key challenges:
high computational complexity in trading mechanisms, and suboptimal participant
decision-making under diverse uncertainties. Existing prediction-based
decision-making methods rely heavily on accurate forecasts, which are typically
unavailable for microgrids, while prediction-free methods suffer from myopic
behaviors. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an improved double
auction mechanism combined with an adaptive step-size search algorithm to
reduce computational burden, and a data-driven dual-reference online
optimization (DDOO) framework to enhance participant decision-making. The
improved mechanism simplifies bidding procedures, significantly reducing
computational burden and ensuring rapid convergence to the market equilibrium.
Additionally, the prediction-free DDOO framework mitigates myopic
decision-making by introducing two informative reference signals. Case studies
on a 20-microgrid system demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of the
proposed mechanism and approach. The improved mechanism significantly decreases
the computational time while increasing local energy self-sufficiency periods
from 0.01% to 29.86%, reducing reverse power flow periods from 24.51% to 3.96%,
and lowering average operating costs by 19.20%. Compared with conventional
approaches such as Lyapunov optimization and model predictive control, the DDOO
framework achieves a 10%-13% reduction in operating costs with an optimality
gap of only 5.76%.

Abstract: Real-time regulation of water distribution in connected open water systems is
critical for ensuring system safety and meeting operational requirements. In
this work, we consider a connected open water system that includes linkage
hydraulic structures such as weirs, pumps and sluice gates. We propose a
mixed-integer economic zone data-enabled predictive control (DeePC) approach,
which is used to maintain the water levels of the branches within desired zones
to avoid floods and reduce the energy consumption of the pumps in the
considered water system. The proposed DeePC-based approach predicts the future
dynamics of the system water levels, and generates optimal control actions
based on system input and output data, thereby eliminating the need for both
first-principles modeling and explicit data-driven modeling. To achieve
multiple control objectives in order of priority, we utilize lexicographic
optimization and adapt traditional DeePC cost function for zone tracking and
energy consumption minimization. Additionally, Bayesian optimization is
utilized to determine the control target zone, which effectively balances zone
tracking and energy consumption in the presence of external disturbances.
Comprehensive simulations and comparative analyses demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method. The proposed method maintains water
levels within the desired zone for 97.04% of the operating time, with an
average energy consumption of 33.5 kWh per 0.5 h. Compared to baseline methods,
the proposed approach reduces the zone-tracking mean square error by 98.82%
relative to economic zone DeePC without Bayesian optimization, and lowers
energy consumption by 44.08% relative to economic set-point tracking DeePC. As
compared to passive pump/gate control, the proposed method lowers the frequency
of zone violations by 86.94% and the average energy consumption by 4.69%.

Abstract: The paper focuses on tracking eigenvalue trajectories in power system models
with time delays. We formulate a continuation-based approach that employs
numerical integration to follow eigenvalues as system parameters vary, in the
presence of one or multiple delayed variables. The formulation preserves the
sparsity of the delay differential-algebraic equation (DDAE) system model and
allows treating the delay magnitude itself as a varying parameter with
implementation aspects discussed in detail. Accuracy is demonstrated on a
modified IEEE 39-bus system with distributed energy resources. Scalability is
discussed using a realistic dynamic model of the Irish transmission network.

Abstract: Quadrotor stability under complex dynamic disturbances and model
uncertainties poses significant challenges. One of them remains the
underfitting problem in high-dimensional features, which limits the
identification capability of current learning-based methods. To address this,
we introduce a new perspective: Dimension-Decomposed Learning (DiD-L), from
which we develop the Sliced Adaptive-Neuro Mapping (SANM) approach for
geometric control. Specifically, the high-dimensional mapping for
identification is axially ``sliced" into multiple low-dimensional submappings
(``slices"). In this way, the complex high-dimensional problem is decomposed
into a set of simple low-dimensional tasks addressed by shallow neural networks
and adaptive laws. These neural networks and adaptive laws are updated online
via Lyapunov-based adaptation without any pre-training or persistent excitation
(PE) condition. To enhance the interpretability of the proposed approach, we
prove that the full-state closed-loop system exhibits arbitrarily close to
exponential stability despite multi-dimensional time-varying disturbances and
model uncertainties. This result is novel as it demonstrates exponential
convergence without requiring pre-training for unknown disturbances and
specific knowledge of the model.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of typhoon trajectories is essential for mitigating the
impact of these extreme weather events. This study proposes a functional data
analysis (FDA) framework for modeling and forecasting typhoon paths using
historical trajectory data. Latitude and longitude sequences are represented as
smooth functional observations, and a function-on-function regression model is
employed to capture the temporal dynamics of typhoon movement. While the
baseline model demonstrates reasonable performance for typical bow-shaped
trajectories, it exhibits limited accuracy for non-standard paths. To address
this limitation, a clustering-based extension is introduced, wherein typhoons
are grouped by trajectory shape prior to regression. This two-stage approach
improves predictive accuracy by enabling localized modeling adapted to
structural variations in the data. The results demonstrate the practical
utility of combining FDA with clustering for robust and flexible typhoon
trajectory forecasting.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of dynamical response of structural system depends on the
correct modeling of that system. However, modeling becomes increasingly
challenging when there are many candidate models available to describe the
system behavior. Furthermore, uncertainties can be present even for the
parameters of these model classes. The plausibility of each input-output model
class of the structures with uncertain components can be determined by a
Bayesian approach from measured dynamic responses to one or more input records;
predictions of the structural system response to alternate input records can
then be made. However, this approach may require many model simulations, even
though most of those model classes are quite implausible. An approach is
proposed herein to use a bound, computed from the false discovery rate, on the
likelihood of measured data to falsify models considering uncertainties in the
passive control devices that do not reproduce the measured data to sufficient
accuracy. Response prediction is then performed using the unfalsified models in
an approximate Bayesian sense by assigning weights, computed from the
likelihoods, only to the unfalsified models approach incurring only a fraction
of the computational cost of the standard Bayesian approach. The proposed
approach for response prediction is illustrated using three structural
examples: an earthquake-excited four--degree-of-freedom building model with a
hysteretic isolation layer; a 1623--degree-of-freedom three-dimensional
building model, with tuned mass dampers attached to its roof, subjected to wind
loads; and a full-scale four-story base-isolated building tested on world's
largest shake table in Japan's E-Defense lab. The results exhibit accurate
response predictions and significant computational savings, thereby
illustrating the potential of the proposed method.

Abstract: Persistent demographic disparities have been identified in the treatment of
patients seeking care in the emergency department (ED). These may be driven in
part by subconscious biases, which providers themselves may struggle to
identify. To better understand the operation of these biases, we performed a
retrospective cross-sectional analysis using electronic health records
describing 339,400 visits to the ED of a single US pediatric medical center
between 2019-2024. Odds ratios were calculated using propensity-score matching.
Analyses were adjusted for confounding variables, including chief complaint,
insurance type, socio-economic deprivation, and patient comorbidities. We also
trained a machine learning [ML] model on this dataset to identify predictors of
admission. We found significant demographic disparities in admission
(Non-Hispanic Black [NHB] relative to Non-Hispanic White [NHW]: OR 0.77, 95\%
CI 0.73-0.81; Hispanic relative to NHW: OR 0.80, 95\% CI 0.76-0.83). We also
identified disparities in individual decisions taken during the ED stay. For
example, NHB patients were significantly less likely than NHW patients to be
assigned an `emergent' triage acuity score of (OR 0.70, 95\% CI 0.67-0.72), but
emergent NHB patients were also significantly less likely to be admitted than
NHW patients with the same triage acuity (OR 0.86, 95\% CI 0.80-0.93).
Demographic disparities were particularly acute wherever patients had normal
vital signs, public insurance, moderate socio-economic deprivation, or a home
address distant from the hospital. An ML model assigned higher importance to
triage score for NHB than NHW patients when predicting admission, reflecting
these disparities in assignment. We conclude that many visit characteristics,
clinical and otherwise, may influence the operation of subconscious biases and
affect ML-driven decision support tools.

Conclusion: 该方法可推广到其他ICU环境，为面临需求增长和容量限制的医疗系统提供可解释的数据支持

Abstract: Hospitals struggle to make effective long-term capacity planning decisions
for intensive care units (ICUs) under uncertainty in future demand. Admission
rates fluctuate over time due to temporal factors, and length of stay (LOS)
distributions vary with patient heterogeneity, hospital location, case mix, and
clinical practices. Common planning approaches rely on steady-state queueing
models or heuristic rules that assume fixed parameters, but these methods often
fall short in capturing real-world occupancy dynamics. One widely used example
is the 85\% occupancy rule, which recommends maintaining average utilization
below this level to ensure responsiveness; however, this rule is based on
stationary assumptions and may be unreliable when applied to time-varying
systems. Our analysis shows that even when long-run utilization targets are
met, day-to-day occupancy frequently exceeds 100\% capacity.
  We propose a data-driven framework for estimating ICU bed occupancy using an
$M_t/G_t/\infty$ queueing model, which incorporates time-varying arrival rates
and empirically estimated LOS distributions. The framework combines statistical
decomposition and parametric distribution fitting to capture temporal patterns
in ICU admissions and LOS. We apply it to multi-year data from neonatal ICUs
(NICUs) in Calgary as a case study. Several capacity planning scenarios are
evaluated, including average-based thresholds and surge estimates from Poisson
overflow approximations. Results demonstrate the inadequacy of static
heuristics in environments with fluctuating demand and highlight the importance
of modeling LOS variability when estimating bed needs. Although the case study
focuses on NICUs, the methodology generalizes to other ICU settings and
provides interpretable, data-informed support for healthcare systems facing
rising demand and limited capacity.

Abstract: Upcoming astronomical surveys will produce petabytes of high-resolution
images of the night sky, providing information about billions of stars and
galaxies. Detecting and characterizing the astronomical objects in these images
is a fundamental task in astronomy -- and a challenging one, as most of these
objects are faint and many visually overlap with other objects. We propose an
amortized variational inference procedure to solve this instance of
small-object detection. Our key innovation is a family of spatially
autoregressive variational distributions that partition and order the latent
space according to a $K$-color checkerboard pattern. By construction, the
conditional independencies of this variational family mirror those of the
posterior distribution. We fit the variational distribution, which is
parameterized by a convolutional neural network, using neural posterior
estimation (NPE) to minimize an expectation of the forward KL divergence. Using
images from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance. We further demonstrate that the proposed autoregressive structure
greatly improves posterior calibration.

Motivation: 实验经济学中研究者经常偏离预分析计划来补充非预设的发现，但如何解释这些非预注册结果存在广泛不确定性，即使研究者是诚实的，传统推断方法也会因条件性报告而失效。

Method: 提出了考虑条件性报告的推断程序，并应用于Bessone等人(2021)关于城市贫困人口睡眠增加经济影响的研究，评估不同偏离原因下的调整效果。

Result: 根据偏离原因的不同，新方法的调整效果从与传统方法无差异到具有经济显著差异，并考虑了程序对某些形式误设的稳健性。

Conclusion: 需要为期刊采用启发式检查和规范，以处理预分析计划偏离带来的推断问题，确保非预注册结果的有效解释。

Abstract: Pre-analysis plans (PAPs) have become standard in experimental economics
research, but it is nevertheless common to see researchers deviating from their
PAPs to supplement preregistered estimates with non-prespecified findings.
While such ex-post analysis can yield valuable insights, there is broad
uncertainty over how to interpret -- or whether to even acknowledge --
non-preregistered results. In this paper, we consider the case of a
truth-seeking researcher who, after seeing the data, earnestly wishes to report
additional estimates alongside those preregistered in their PAP. We show that,
even absent "nefarious" behavior, conventional confidence intervals and point
estimators are invalid due to the fact that non-preregistered estimates are
only reported in a subset of potential data realizations. We propose inference
procedures that account for this conditional reporting. We apply these
procedures to Bessone et al. (2021), which studies the economic effects of
increased sleep among the urban poor. We demonstrate that, depending on the
reason for deviating, the adjustments from our procedures can range from having
no difference to an economically significant difference relative to
conventional practice. Finally, we consider the robustness of our procedure to
certain forms of misspecification, motivating possible heuristic checks and
norms for journals to adopt.

Abstract: We introduce a model of dynamic matching with transferable utility, extending
the static model of Shapley and Shubik (1971). Forward-looking agents have
individual states that evolve with current matches. Each period, a matching
market with market-clearing prices takes place. We prove the existence of an
equilibrium with time-varying distributions of agent types and show it is the
solution to a social planner's problem. We also prove that a stationary
equilibrium exists. We introduce econometric shocks to account for unobserved
heterogeneity in match formation. We propose two algorithms to compute a
stationary equilibrium. We adapt both algorithms for estimation. We estimate a
model of accumulation of job-specific human capital using data on Swedish
engineers.

Result: FPAS + ζ框架相比FPAS和ARIMA具有更低的RMSE和更好的周期响应能力，并能提供冲击和制度转换的早期预警。

Conclusion: FPAS + ζ混合框架在通胀预测中表现出实用价值，尤其适用于政策机构应对复杂经济环境。

Abstract: Inflation forecasting is a core socio-economic challenge in modern
macroeconomic modeling, especially when cyclical, structural, and shock factors
act simultaneously. Traditional systems such as FPAS and ARIMA often struggle
with cyclical asymmetry and unexpected fluctuations. This study proposes a
hybrid framework (FPAS + $\zeta$) that integrates a structural macro model
(FPAS) with cyclical components derived from the Riemann zeta function
$\zeta(1/2 + i t)$. Using Georgia's macro data (2005-2024), a nonlinear
argument $t$ is constructed from core variables (e.g., GDP, M3, policy rate),
and the hybrid forecast is calibrated by minimizing RMSE via a modulation
coefficient $\alpha$. Fourier-based spectral analysis and a Hidden Markov Model
(HMM) are employed for cycle/phase identification, and a multi-criteria
AHP-TOPSIS scheme compares FPAS, FPAS + $\zeta$, and ARIMA. Results show lower
RMSE and superior cyclical responsiveness for FPAS + $\zeta$, along with
early-warning capability for shocks and regime shifts, indicating practical
value for policy institutions.
