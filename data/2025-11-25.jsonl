This distinguishes our approach from most existing limit theorems in network econometrics, which are based on weak dependence concepts such as strong mixing, near-epoch dependence, and $ψ$-dependence. By relaxing the assumption of an underlying metric space, our theorems can be applied to a broader range of network data, including financial and social networks. To derive the limit theorems, we generalize the concept of functional dependence (also known as physical dependence) from time series to random variables with network dependence. Using this framework, we establish several inequalities, a law of large numbers, and central limit theorems. Furthermore, we verify the conditions for these limit theorems based on primitive assumptions for spatial autoregressive models, which are widely used in network data analysis."}

We employ a selective conditional inference approach, deriving the conditional distribution of coefficient estimates given the group structure estimated from the data. Our procedure provides valid inference under possible violations of group separation, where distributional properties of group-specific coefficients remain unestablished. Furthermore, even when group separation does hold, our method demonstrates superior finite-sample properties compared to traditional asymptotic approaches. This improvement stems from our procedure's ability to account for statistical uncertainty in the estimation of group structure. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through Monte Carlo simulations and apply the methods to two datasets on: (i) the relationship between income and democracy, and (ii) the cyclicality of firm-level R&D investment."}

We also show that our ReLU-based maximum score (RMS) estimator can be generalized to an umbrella framework defined by multi-index single-crossing (MISC) conditions, while the original maximum score estimator cannot be applied. We establish the $n^{-s/(2s+1)}$ convergence rate and asymptotic normality for the RMS estimator under order-$s$ Holder smoothness. In addition, we propose an alternative estimator using a further reformulation of RMS as a special layer in a deep neural network (DNN) architecture, which allows the estimation procedure to be implemented via state-of-the-art software and hardware for DNN."}

The framework yields estimates of $R_t$ and relative infections, enabling a coherent interpretation of transmission timing and phase. We compare two input strategies-(i) raw viral-load measurements with a log-scale standard deviation, and (ii) state-space-filtered load estimates with time-varying variances-and find no practically meaningful differences in inferred trajectories or peak timing. Given this equivalence, we report the filtered input as a pragmatic default because it embeds week-specific variances while leaving epidemiological conclusions unchanged."}

Originally published at Euromicro Conference DSD 2024", "summary": "The field of autonomous vehicle research is advancing rapidly, necessitating platforms that meet real-time performance, safety, and security requirements for practical deployment. AUTOSAR Adaptive Platform (AUTOSAR AP) is widely adopted in development to meet these criteria; however, licensing constraints and tool implementation challenges limit its use in research. Conversely, Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) is predominantly used in research within the autonomous driving domain, leading to a disparity between research and development platforms that hinders swift commercialization. This paper proposes a collaboration framework that enables AUTOSAR AP and ROS 2 to communicate with each other using a Data Distribution Service for Real-Time Systems (DDS). In contrast, AUTOSAR AP uses Scalable service-Oriented Middleware over IP (SOME/IP) for communication. The proposed framework bridges these protocol differences, ensuring seamless interaction between the two platforms. We validate the functionality and performance of our bridge converter through empirical analysis, demonstrating its efficiency in conversion time and ease of integration with ROS 2 tools. Furthermore, the availability of the proposed collaboration framework is improved by automatically generating a configuration file for the proposed bridge converter."}

However, extending these models to self-supervised regimes remains challenging because the discontinuities introduced by spikes break the cross-view gradient correspondences required by contrastive and consistency-driven objectives. This work introduces a training paradigm that enables large SNN architectures to be optimized without labeled data. We formulate a dual-path neuron in which a spike-generating process is paired with a differentiable surrogate branch, allowing gradients to propagate across augmented inputs while preserving a fully spiking implementation at inference. In addition, we propose temporal alignment objectives that enforce representational coherence both across spike timesteps and between augmented views. Using convolutional and transformer-style SNN backbones, we demonstrate ImageNet-scale self-supervised pretraining and strong transfer to classification, detection, and segmentation benchmarks. Our best model, a fully self-supervised Spikformer-16-512, achieves 70.1% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K, demonstrating that unlabeled learning in high-capacity SNNs is feasible at modern scale"}

Building on a previously formalized metric, the Artificial Age Score (AAS), the study maps twenty core propositions from the Monadology to an information-theoretic architecture. In this design, each monad functions as a modular unit defined by a truth score, a redundancy parameter, and a weighted contribution to a global memory penalty function. Smooth logarithmic transformations operationalize these quantities and yield interpretable, bounded metrics for memory aging, representational stability, and salience. Classical metaphysical notions of perception, apperception, and appetition are reformulated as entropy, gradient dynamics, and internal representation fidelity. Logical principles, including the laws of non-contradiction and sufficient reason, are encoded as regularization constraints guiding memory evolution. A central contribution is a set of first principles proofs establishing refinement invariance, structural decomposability, and monotonicity under scale transformation, aligned with the metaphysical structure of monads. The framework's formal organization is structured into six thematic bundles derived from Monadology, aligning each mathematical proof with its corresponding philosophical domain. Beyond evaluation, the framework offers a principled blueprint for building Al memory architectures that are modular, interpretable, and provably sound."}

This work introduces a physically principled framework, Diffusion Distance with Personalized PageRank (D-PPR), which unifies static topology with dynamic information flow by modeling nodes as signal sources propagating through the network via Personalized PageRank (PPR) vectors. The method quantifies node-pair similarity through the graph Laplacian-governed diffusion distance between their topology-aware signal distributions, thereby bridging microscopic interactions with macroscopic network dynamics. Systematic benchmarking on synthetic (Barabási-Albert, LFR) and seven large-scale real-world networks spanning technology, biology, and social domains demonstrates that D-PPR achieves highly competitive performance, yielding favorable results when compared to representative local and global heuristics, particularly in sparse and modular networks. These findings establish a rigorous foundation for physics-inspired link prediction by revealing that incorporating dynamical processes into structural similarity metrics enables deeper insights into network connectivity patterns, offering both methodological advances and new theoretical perspectives on the interplay between topology and dynamics."}

We present an implicit neural field-based framework for multi-axis process planning that overcomes these limitations by embedding both layer generation and toolpath design within a single differentiable pipeline. Using sinusoidally activated neural networks to represent layers and toolpaths as implicit fields, our method enables direct evaluation of field values and derivatives at any spatial point, thereby allowing explicit collision avoidance and joint optimization of manufacturing layers and toolpaths. We further investigate how network hyperparameters and objective definitions influence singularity behavior and topology transitions, offering built-in mechanisms for regularization and stability control. The proposed approach is demonstrated on examples in both additive and subtractive manufacturing, validating its generality and effectiveness."}

However, many current EEG systems remain challenging for users with neurological conditions due to bulky wiring, lengthy skin preparation, gel-induced discomfort, risk of irritation, and high cost, all of which limit long-term monitoring. This study presents a proof-of-concept smart modular headband incorporating adjustable, replaceable embroidered electrodes for EEG acquisition. Compared with conventional devices, the smart headband reduces wiring complexity, removes the need for skin preparation, and minimizes irritation associated with gel-based electrodes. Its modular structure allows adjustable fitting without requiring multiple size options, enhancing comfort and adaptability for everyday EEG monitoring. The smart headband prototype was tested on 10 healthy university students using three behavioral tasks: (1) eyes open/closed, (2) auditory oddball, and (3) visual oddball paradigms. The smart headband successfully captured alpha peaks during the eyes-open/closed task (p = 0.01) and reliably recorded the event-related potentials associated with the oddball effects - the auditory P300 (p = 0.014) and the visual N170 (p = 0.013) - demonstrating an equivalent performance to a commercial sponge-based EEG cap. A user survey indicated improved comfort and usability, with participants reporting that the soft, structurally designed headband enhanced wearability relative to a conventional cap. Overall, this prototype provides a comfortable, modular, and cost-effective solution to reliable EEG monitoring in real-world applications."}

However, each model nesting and data conversion may cause information loss, and it is necessary to streamline the tools to facilitate architects and users to participate in the design. Therefore, this study hopes to prove that I2I GAN also has the potential to recognize topological relationships autonomously. Therefore, this research proposes a method for quickly detecting the ability of pix2pix to learn topological relationships, which is achieved by adding two Grasshopper-based detection modules before and after GAN. At the same time, quantitative data is provided and its learning process is visualized, and changes in different input modes such as greyscale and RGB affect its learning efficiency. There are two innovations in this paper: 1) It proves that pix2pix can automatically learn spatial topological relationships and apply them to architectural design. 2) It fills the gap in detecting the performance of Image-based Generation GAN from a topological perspective. Moreover, the detection method proposed in this study takes a short time and is simple to operate. The two detection modules can be widely used for customizing image datasets with the same topological structure and for batch detection of topological relationships of images. In the future, this paper may provide a theoretical foundation and data support for the application of architectural design and urban renewal that use GAN to preserve spatial topological characteristics."}

News recommender systems (NRSs) have shown to be useful in this process, minimizing political disengagement and information overload by providing individuals with articles on topics that matter to them. Unfortunately, NRSs often conflate underlying user interest with the partisan bias of the articles in their reading history and with the most popular biases present in the coverage of their favored topics. Over extended interaction, this can result in the formation of filter bubbles and the polarization of user partisanship. In this paper, we propose a novel embedding space called Constructed Political Coordinates (CPC), which models the political partisanship of users over a given topic-space, relative to a larger sample population. We apply a simple collaborative filtering (CF) framework using CPC-based correlation to recommend articles sourced from oppositional users, who have different biases from the user in question. We compare against classical CF methods and find that CPC-based methods promote pointed bias diversity and better match the true political tolerance of users, while classical methods implicitly exploit biases to maximize interaction."}

Machine learning is increasingly used for EEA by modeling rare weather events otherwise too complex or computationally intensive to model using traditional simulation methods. However, the validity of using machine learning in this context remains unclear, particularly as high-stakes machine learning applications in general are criticized for inherent bias and lack of robustness. Here we use machine learning and simulation analyses to evaluate EEA in the context of California wildfire data from 2003-2020. We identify three major threats to validity: (1) individual event attribution estimates are highly sensitive to algorithmic design choices; (2) common performance metrics like area under the ROC curve or Brier score are not strongly correlated with attribution error, facilitating suboptimal model selection; and (3) distribution shift -- changes in temperature across climate scenarios -- substantially degrades predictive performance.

In recent years, self-determination enhancing technologies have been developed and used to promote independent living among people with self-determination disorders. We will illustrate the main digital tools to support self-determination developed for two populations of people suffering from self-determination disorders: people with an intellectual disability and people with an autism spectrum disorder.

This study examines the relationship between access to finance and food security among smallholder farmers in Ogun State, employing institutional theory as a theoretical framework. The study takes a quantitative method, with a survey for the research design and a population of 37,200 agricultural smallholder farmers.

We implement our model within a Penalized Spline framework and estimate it using Generalized Linear Array Model techniques, resulting in a computationally fast, interpretable, and parsimonious method. Crucially, it can readily incorporate sudden mortality shocks, such as the Covid-19 pandemic, making it highly versatile for real-world demographic and epidemiological challenges.

Therefore, facing rapidly emerging generative models and diverse data distribution, it is of vital importance to improve LLMs' generalizable reasoning to verify the authenticity of visual inputs against potential deceptions. Inspired by human cognitive processes, we discovered that LLMs exhibit tendency of over-trusting the visual inputs, while injecting skepticism could significantly improve the models visual cognitive capability against visual deceptions. Based on this discovery, we propose \\textbf{Inception}, a fully reasoning-based agentic reasoning framework to conduct generalizable authenticity verification by injecting skepticism, where LLMs' reasoning logic is iteratively enhanced between External Skeptic and Internal Skeptic agents.

A range of theories seek to explain why humans are so adept at iterated learning, many positing substantial evolutionary discontinuities in communication or cognition. Is it necessary to posit large differences in abilities between humans and other species, or could small differences in communication ability produce large differences in what a species can learn over generations? We investigate this question through a formal model based on information theory. We manipulate how much information individual learners can send each other and observe the effect on iterated learning performance. Incremental changes to the channel rate can lead to dramatic, non-linear changes to the eventual performance of the population. We complement this model with a theoretical result that describes how individual lossy communications constrain the global performance of iterated learning. Our results demonstrate that incremental, quantitative changes to communication abilities could be sufficient to explain large differences in what can be learned over many generations."}

We extend classical optical flow formulations by integrating them with depth modeling strategies tailored to the geometry for lunar/planetary approach, descent, and landing, specifically, planar and spherical terrain approximations parameterized by a laser rangefinder. Motion field inversion is performed through a least-squares framework, using sparse optical flow features extracted via the pyramidal Lucas-Kanade algorithm. We verify our approach using synthetically generated lunar images over the challenging terrain of the lunar south pole, using CPU budgets compatible with small lunar landers. The results demonstrate accurate velocity estimation from approach to landing, with sub-10% error for complex terrain and on the order of 1% for more typical terrain, as well as performances suitable for real-time applications.

We introduce Structured Cognitive Loop (SCL), a modular architecture that explicitly separates agent cognition into five phases: Retrieval, Cognition, Control, Action, and Memory (R-CCAM). At the core of SCL is Soft Symbolic Control, an adaptive governance mechanism that applies symbolic constraints to probabilistic inference, preserving neural flexibility while restoring the explainability and controllability of classical symbolic systems. Through empirical validation on multi-step conditional reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that SCL achieves zero policy violations, eliminates redundant tool calls, and maintains complete decision traceability. These results address critical gaps in existing frameworks such as ReAct, AutoGPT, and memory-augmented approaches. Our contributions are threefold: (1) we situate SCL within the taxonomy of hybrid intelligence, differentiating it from prompt-centric and memory-only approaches; (2) we formally define Soft Symbolic Control and contrast it with neuro-symbolic AI; and (3) we derive three design principles for trustworthy agents: modular decomposition, adaptive symbolic governance, and transparent state management. We provide a complete open-source implementation demonstrating the R-CCAM loop architecture, alongside a live GPT-4o-powered travel planning agent. By connecting expert system principles with modern LLM capabilities, this work offers a practical and theoretically grounded path toward reliable, explainable, and governable AI agents.

This study investigates how emotional arousal, indexed by skin conductance responses,SCR, relates to trust behavior in a modified centipede game. To examine the impact of uncertainty, the game incorporated both fixed and random termination conditions. SCRs were recorded alongside self-reported measures of mutual and general trust and individual risk-taking propensity. Phasic SCRs were significantly higher under random termination, particularly following the opponent take actions, indicating increased emotional arousal under uncertainty. Mutual trust scores correlated positively with risk propensity but not with general trust. Behaviorally, higher mutual trust was associated with extended cooperative play, but only in the fixed-turn condition. These findings suggest that physiological arousal reflects emotional engagement in trust-related decisions and that uncertainty amplifies both arousal and strategic caution. Mutual trust appears context-dependent, shaped by emotional and physiological states that influence deviations from equilibrium behavior."}

This work investigates the stability and inter-event time properties of a control-affine system under event-based impulsive control. The controller consists of multiple neuronal units with leaky integrate-and-fire dynamics acting on a time-invariant, multiple-input multiple-output plant in closed loop. Both the plant state and the neuronal units exhibit discontinuities that cancel if combined linearly, enabling a direct correspondence between the event-based impulsive controller and a corresponding analogue controller. Leveraging this observation, we prove global practical stability of the event-based impulsive control system. In the general nonlinear case, we show that the event-based impulsive controller ensures global practical asymptotic stability if the analogue system is input-to-state stable (ISS) with respect to specific disturbances.

This work investigates the stability and inter-event time properties of a control-affine system under event-based impulsive control. The controller consists of multiple neuronal units with leaky integrate-and-fire dynamics acting on a time-invariant, multiple-input multiple-output plant in closed loop. Both the plant state and the neuronal units exhibit discontinuities that cancel if combined linearly, enabling a direct correspondence between the event-based impulsive controller and a corresponding analogue controller. Leveraging this observation, we prove global practical stability of the event-based impulsive control system. In the general nonlinear case, we show that the event-based impulsive controller ensures global practical asymptotic stability if the analogue system is input-to-state stable (ISS) with respect to specific disturbances. In the linear case, we further show global practical exponential stability if the analogue system is stable. We illustrate our results with numerical simulations. The findings reveal a fundamental link between analogue and event-based impulsive control, providing new insights for the design of neuromorphic controllers."}

Understanding and quantifying homophily (similarity-driven association) in such networks is essential for analyzing community formation and information flow. We propose a hyperedge-centric framework to quantify homophily in hypergraphs. Each interaction is represented as a hyperedge, and its interaction perplexity measures the effective number of distinct attributes it contains. Comparing this observed perplexity with a degree-preserving random baseline defines the diversity gap, which quantifies how diverse an interaction is than expected by chance. The global homophily score for a network, called Perplexity-Homophily Index, is computed by averaging the normalized diversity gap across all hyperedges. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that the proposed index captures the full distribution of homophily and reveals how homophilic and heterophilic tendencies vary with interaction size in hypergraphs."}

Yet little is known about how virtual ecological environments influence this mindset. As digital worlds become increasingly immersive and ecologically sophisticated, they provide novel contexts for examining how human value systems are formed and transformed. This study investigates how virtual environment-modification behaviors and players' sense of immersiveness jointly shape exceptionalism, drawing on worldviews from quantum mechanics and mathematical logic. Using Granular Interaction Thinking Theory (GITT) and the Bayesian Mindsponge Framework (BMF analytics), we analyze five key activities--tree planting, flower planting, flower crossbreeding, terraforming, and creating conditions for bug respawn--based on a multinational dataset of 640 Animal Crossing: New Horizons players from 29 countries. Results reveal two behavioral clusters distinguished by controllability. High-controllability behaviors (i.e., flower planting and terraforming) predict higher exceptionalism, whereas the flower-planting effect reverses among highly immersed players. Low-controllability behaviors (i.e., flower crossbreeding and manipulating bug spawning) predict lower exceptionalism, but these associations weaken or reverse under high immersiveness, respectively. These findings offer insights into leveraging virtual worlds to cultivate Nature Quotient (NQ), mitigate exceptionalist tendencies, and foster eco-surplus cultural orientations."}

Conventional centrality measures, particularly gravity-based models, often depend on pairwise interaction forces and a fixed radius of influence, which oversimplify the heterogeneous and dynamic nature of real networks. To overcome these limitations, this study proposes a novel non-interactive, action-based model, termed Yukawa Potential Centrality (YPC), which adapts the physical Yukawa potential to the topology of complex networks. Unlike gravity models, YPC computes a scalar potential for each node rather than pairwise forces, dynamically adjusting its radius of influence according to local structural properties. This formulation establishes a physically interpretable bridge between potential theory and network science, while significantly reducing computational complexity, from quadratic to near-linear time. The model is evaluated across both synthetic and real-world social networks, and its node rankings are compared with classical centrality indices and epidemic spreading models (SI and SIS). Experimental findings reveal that YPC exhibits a strong positive correlation with the SIS model and effectively isolates key spreaders, even within highly irregular topologies. These results demonstrate that YPC provides a scalable, adaptive, and theoretically grounded framework for influence analysis in social, biological, and communication networks."}

This study investigates how emotional arousal, indexed by skin conductance responses,SCR, relates to trust behavior in a modified centipede game. To examine the impact of uncertainty, the game incorporated both fixed and random termination conditions. SCRs were recorded alongside self-reported measures of mutual and general trust and individual risk-taking propensity. Phasic SCRs were significantly higher under random termination, particularly following the opponent take actions, indicating increased emotional arousal under uncertainty. Mutual trust scores correlated positively with risk propensity but not with general trust. Behaviorally, higher mutual trust was associated with extended cooperative play, but only in the fixed-turn condition. These findings suggest that physiological arousal reflects emotional engagement in trust-related decisions and that uncertainty amplifies both arousal and strategic caution. Mutual trust appears context-dependent, shaped by emotional and physiological states that influence deviations from equilibrium behavior."}

We develop a unified computational framework (DP + Monte Carlo) that introduces Cognitive Heterogeneity across classes. Our Hybrid Model (M-H) posits that the poor act as \"Rational Survivors\" (M1 utility, Reality parameters), while the middle/rich act as \"Biased Strivers\" (M4b utility, Belief parameters).\n  Our simulations yield three core findings. First, we confirm that the \"Survival\" strategy is objectively rational whenever risk exceeds a low threshold ($σ> 0.45$). Given that real-world risk is massive ($σ_{Real} \\approx 4.9$), the modern \"Quality\" strategy is objectively fragile. Second, the trap for the Middle/Rich ($B \\ge 200$) is driven by a \"Two-Stage Belief Error\": they are first \"baited\" by a Causal Error (underestimating risk) to enter the status game, and then \"trapped\" by a Marginal Error (underestimating returns) which triggers a stop in fertility. Third, the U-shape is driven by the cognitive divide. The Poor escape the trap by retaining a \"Rational Survival\" strategy in the face of real high risk. Conversely, the Aspirational Middle Class ($HC \\approx 12, B \\ge 200$) is uniquely trapped by their Biased Beliefs. Their high competence raises their dynastic reference point ($R$) to a level where, under perceived low returns, restricting fertility to $N=1$ becomes the only rational choice within their biased belief system."}

A super-Gaussian laser-tissue interaction (LTI) model characterizes ablation crater morphology with an average RMSE of 0.231+-0.121mm, outperforming Gaussian baselines. A sampling-based model predictive control (MPC) framework operates directly on OCT voxel data to generate constraint-aware resection trajectories with closed-loop feedback, achieving 0.842mm RMSE and improving intersection-over-union agreement by 64.8% compared to feedforward execution. With OCT, RATS detects subsurface structures and modifies the planner's objective to preserve them, demonstrating clinical feasibility."}

As engineered systems grow in complexity, conventional FMEA methods, largely manual, document-centric, and expert-dependent, have become increasingly inadequate for addressing the demands of modern systems engineering. We examine how techniques from Artificial Intelligence (AI), including machine learning and natural language processing, can transform FMEA into a more dynamic, data-driven, intelligent, and model-integrated process by automating failure prediction, prioritisation, and knowledge extraction from operational data. In parallel, we explore the role of ontologies in formalising system knowledge, supporting semantic reasoning, improving traceability, and enabling cross-domain interoperability. The review also synthesises emerging hybrid approaches, such as ontology-informed learning and large language model integration, which further enhance explainability and automation. These developments are discussed within the broader context of Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) and function modelling, showing how AI and ontologies can support more adaptive and resilient FMEA workflows. We critically analyse a range of tools, case studies, and integration strategies, while identifying key challenges related to data quality, explainability, standardisation, and interdisciplinary adoption. By leveraging AI, systems engineering, and knowledge representation using ontologies, this review offers a structured roadmap for embedding FMEA within intelligent, knowledge-rich engineering environments."}

However, HD map-dependent models suffer from costly data acquisition, delayed updates, and vulnerability to corrupted inputs, causing prediction failures. Map-free approaches lack global context, with pairwise attention over-amplifying straight patterns while suppressing transitional patterns, resulting in motion-intention misalignment. This paper proposes GContextFormer, a plug-and-play encoder-decoder architecture with global context-aware hybrid attention and scaled additive aggregation achieving intention-aligned multimodal prediction without map reliance. The Motion-Aware Encoder builds scene-level intention prior via bounded scaled additive aggregation over mode-embedded trajectory tokens and refines per-mode representations under shared global context, mitigating inter-mode suppression and promoting intention alignment. The Hierarchical Interaction Decoder decomposes social reasoning into dual-pathway cross-attention: a standard pathway ensures uniform geometric coverage over agent-mode pairs while a neighbor-context-enhanced pathway emphasizes salient interactions, with gating module mediating their contributions to maintain coverage-focus balance. Experiments on eight highway-ramp scenarios from TOD-VT dataset show GContextFormer outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Compared to existing transformer models, GContextFormer achieves greater robustness and concentrated improvements in high-curvature and transition zones via spatial distributions. Interpretability is achieved through motion mode distinctions and neighbor context modulation exposing reasoning attribution. The modular architecture supports extensibility toward cross-domain multimodal reasoning tasks. Source: https://fenghy-chen.github.io/sources/."}

Rather than stemming from material utility or cash flows, Bitcoin's value arises from informational attributes and interactions of multiple factors, including cryptographic order, decentralization-enabled autonomy, trust embedded in the consensus mechanism, and socio-narrative coherence that reduce entropy within decentralized value-exchange processes. To empirically assess this perspective, a Bayesian linear model was estimated using daily data from 2022 to 2025, operationalizing four informational value dimensions: Store-of-Value (SOV), Autonomy (AUT), Social-Signal Value (SSV), and Hedonic-Sentiment Value (HSV). Results indicate that only SSV exerts a highly credible positive effect on next-day returns, highlighting the dominant role of high-entropy social information in short-term pricing dynamics. In contrast, SOV and AUT show moderately reliable positive associations, reflecting their roles as low-entropy structural anchors of long-term value. HSV displays no credible predictive effect. The study advances interdisciplinary value theory and demonstrates Bitcoin as a dual-layer entropy-regulating socio-technological ecosystem. The findings offer implications for digital asset valuation, investment education, and future research on entropy dynamics across non-cash-flow digital assets."}

In our iterative workflow, human safety requirements are translated by regulators into Signal Temporal Logic (STL) specifications. Rollout traces from the black-box model are externally verified for compliance, yielding quantitative safety metrics, Total Robustness Value (TRV) and Largest Robustness Value (LRV), which measure average and worst-case specification adherence. These metrics inform targeted retraining and iterative improvement by model designers. We apply our method across two different applications: a virtual driving scenario and an autonomous mobile robot navigating a complex environment, and observe statistically significant improvements across both scenarios. In the virtual driving scenario, we see a 177% increase in traces adhering to the simulation speed limit, a 1138% increase in traces minimizing off-road driving, and a 16% increase in traces successfully reaching the goal within the time limit. In the autonomous navigation scenario, there is a 300% increase in traces avoiding sharp turns, a 200% increase in traces reaching the goal within the time limit, and a 49% increase in traces minimizing time spent near obstacles.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise, they often fail to capture the precise, reusable expertise that engineers apply, leading to inaccurate responses. We propose GROVE, a hierarchical knowledge management framework that learns and organizes reusable debugging expertise into an LLM-organized knowledge tree for solving assertion failures. GROVE distills debugging knowledge from prior cases and organizes it into a vertical tree of configurable depth, with each node encoding a concise knowledge item and explicit applicability conditions. During training, GROVE uses a parallel, gradient-free loop where an LLM proposes tree modifications as structured JSON edits by learning from the cases. At test time, a budget-aware iterative zoom is performed to navigate the tree, retrieving a small set of applicable knowledge items that guide a base LLM's hypothesis generation and fix proposals. Evaluated on a suite of assertion-failure cases, GROVE delivers consistent gains in pass@1 and pass@5, demonstrating the value of structured knowledge evolution."}

Traditional solutions, such as regulatory actions, have been implemented to mitigate the spread of misinformation; however, these measures alone are not sufficient. To complement these efforts, educational approaches are becoming essential in empowering users to critically engage with misinformation. Conversation training, through serious games or personalized methods, has emerged as a promising strategy to help users handle science denial and toxic conversation tactics. This paper suggests an interdisciplinary seminar to explore the suitability of Large Language Models (LLMs) acting as a persona of a science denier to support people in identifying misinformation and improving resilience against toxic interactions. In the seminar, groups of four to five students will develop an AI-based chatbot that enables realistic interactions with science-denial argumentation structures. The task involves planning the setting, integrating a Large Language Model to facilitate natural dialogues, implementing the chatbot using the RASA framework, and evaluating the outcomes in a user study. It is crucial that users understand what they need to do during the interaction, how to conclude it, and how the relevant information is conveyed. The seminar does not aim to develop chatbots for practicing debunking but serves to teach AI technologies and test the feasibility of this idea for future applications. The chatbot seminar is conducted as a hybrid, parallel master's module at the participating educational institutions."}

While recent optimization-based methods such as Hierarchical Task Model Predictive Control (HTMPC) enable efficient multitask execution with strict task priorities, they have so far been applied mainly to static or structured scenarios. Extending these approaches to dynamic human-centered environments requires predictive models that capture how humans react to the actions of the robot. This work introduces Safe Mobile Manipulation with Interactive Human Prediction via Task-Hierarchical Bilevel Model Predictive Control (SM$^2$ITH), a unified framework that combines HTMPC with interactive human motion prediction through bilevel optimization that jointly accounts for robot and human dynamics. The framework is validated on two different mobile manipulators, the Stretch 3 and the Ridgeback-UR10, across three experimental settings: (i) delivery tasks with different navigation and manipulation priorities, (ii) sequential pick-and-place tasks with different human motion prediction models, and (iii) interactions involving adversarial human behavior. Our results highlight how interactive prediction enables safe and efficient coordination, outperforming baselines that rely on weighted objectives or open-loop human models."}

We introduce QuickLAP: Quick Language-Action Preference learning, a Bayesian framework that fuses physical and language feedback to infer reward functions in real time. Our key insight is to treat language as a probabilistic observation over the user's latent preferences, clarifying which reward features matter and how physical corrections should be interpreted. QuickLAP uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract reward feature attention masks and preference shifts from free-form utterances, which it integrates with physical feedback in a closed-form update rule. This enables fast, real-time, and robust reward learning that handles ambiguous feedback. In a semi-autonomous driving simulator, QuickLAP reduces reward learning error by over 70% compared to physical-only and heuristic multimodal baselines. A 15-participant user study further validates our approach: participants found QuickLAP significantly more understandable and collaborative, and preferred its learned behavior over baselines.

As large language models increasingly enable the creation of sophisticated fake news, understanding human detection capabilities becomes crucial, particularly across different cultural contexts. We conducted a survey where 89 participants (56 South Africans, 33 from other nationalities) evaluated 10 true South African news articles and 10 AI-generated fake versions. Results reveal an asymmetric pattern: South Africans demonstrated superior performance in detecting true news about their country (40% deviation from ideal rating) compared to other participants (52%), but performed worse at identifying fake news (62% vs. 55%). This difference may reflect South Africans' higher overall trust in news sources. Our analysis further shows that South Africans relied more on content knowledge and contextual understanding when judging credibility, while participants from other countries emphasised formal linguistic features such as grammar and structure. Overall, the deviation from ideal rating was similar between groups (51% vs. 53%), suggesting that cultural familiarity appears to aid verification of authentic information but may also introduce bias when evaluating fabricated content.

We introduce a reinforcement learning framework that uses a prompt-based evaluation mechanism, incorporating established divergent thinking metrics from creativity research. A base language model is fine-tuned using this framework to reward outputs demonstrating higher novelty through higher degrees of conceptual connectivity. Interestingly, the experimental results suggest that RL-based associative thinking-trained models not only generate more original and coherent stories but also exhibit improved abstraction and flexibility in tasks such as programming and data visualization. Our findings provide initial evidence that modeling cognitive creativity principles through reinforcement learning can yield more adaptive and generative AI."}

Today, these natively-DC devices typically connect within buildings through alternating current (AC) distribution systems, entailing significant energy losses due to conversions between AC and DC. This paper investigates the alternative of connecting DC devices through DC distribution. Specifically, this paper shows through laboratory and field experiments that an off-the-shelf residential heat pump designed for conventional AC systems can be powered directly on DC with few hardware modifications and little change in performance. Supporting simulations of a DC nanogrid including historical heat pump and rest-of-house load measurements, a solar photovoltaic array, and a stationary battery suggest that connecting these devices through DC distribution could decrease annual electricity bills by 12.5% with an after-market AC-to-DC heat pump retrofit and by 16.7% with a heat pump designed to run on DC."}

Concurrently, several works have demonstrated that simple learning objectives, such as L1 regression, can achieve performance comparable to denoising-based methods on certain tasks, while offering faster convergence and inference. In this paper, we focus on how to combine the advantages of these two paradigms: retaining the ability of denoising models to capture multi-modal distributions and avoid mode collapse while achieving the efficiency of the L1 regression objective. To achieve this vision, we reformulate the original v-prediction flow matching and transform it into sample-prediction with the L1 training objective. We empirically show that the multi-modality can be expressed via a single ODE step. Thus, we propose \\textbf{L1 Flow}, a two-step sampling schedule that generates a suboptimal action sequence via a single integration step and then reconstructs the precise action sequence through a single prediction. The proposed method largely retains the advantages of flow matching while reducing the iterative neural function evaluations to merely two and mitigating the potential performance degradation associated with direct sample regression. We evaluate our method with varying baselines and benchmarks, including 8 tasks in MimicGen, 5 tasks in RoboMimic \\& PushT Bench, and one task in the real-world scenario. The results show the advantages of the proposed method with regard to training efficiency, inference speed, and overall performance. \\href{https://song-wx.github.io/l1flow.github.io/}{Project Website.}"}

As a result, the actual ability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to process and integrate chemically meaningful information across modalities remains unclear. We introduce \\textbf{ChemVTS-Bench}, a domain-authentic benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the Visual-Textual-Symbolic (VTS) reasoning abilities of MLLMs. ChemVTS-Bench contains diverse and challenging chemical problems spanning organic molecules, inorganic materials, and 3D crystal structures, with each task presented in three complementary input modes: (1) visual-only, (2) visual-text hybrid, and (3) SMILES-based symbolic input. This design enables fine-grained analysis of modality-dependent reasoning behaviors and cross-modal integration. To ensure rigorous and reproducible evaluation, we further develop an automated agent-based workflow that standardizes inference, verifies answers, and diagnoses failure modes. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal that visual-only inputs remain challenging, structural chemistry is the hardest domain, and multimodal fusion mitigates but does not eliminate visual, knowledge-based, or logical errors, highlighting ChemVTS-Bench as a rigorous, domain-faithful testbed for advancing multimodal chemical reasoning. All data and code will be released to support future research."}

We present Switch-JustDance, a low-cost and reproducible benchmarking pipeline that leverages motion-sensing console games, Just Dance on the Nintendo Switch, to evaluate robot whole-body control. Using Just Dance on the Nintendo Switch as a representative platform, Switch-JustDance converts in-game choreography into robot-executable motions through streaming, motion reconstruction, and motion retargeting modules and enables users to evaluate controller performance through the game's built-in scoring system. We first validate the evaluation properties of Just Dance, analyzing its reliability, validity, sensitivity, and potential sources of bias. Our results show that the platform provides consistent and interpretable performance measures, making it a suitable tool for benchmarking embodied AI. Building on this foundation, we benchmark three state-of-the-art humanoid whole-body controllers on hardware and provide insights into their relative strengths and limitations."}

Today, that gateway is widening with advances in large language models (LLMs) and artificial intelligence (AI)-powered coding assistants. What matters is no longer just fluency in traditional programming languages but the ability to think computationally by translating problems into forms that can be solved with computing tools. The capabilities enabled by these AI-augmented tools are rapidly leading to the commoditization of computational thinking, such that anyone who can articulate a problem in natural language can potentially harness computing power via AI.\n  This shift is poised to radically influence how we teach computer science and data science in the United States and around the world. Educators and industry leaders are grappling with how to adapt: What should students learn when the hottest new programming language is English? How do we prepare a generation of computational thinkers who need not code every algorithm manually, but must still think critically, design solutions, and verify AI-augmented results?\n  This paper explores these questions, examining the impact of natural language programming on software development, the emerging distinction between programmers and prompt-crafting problem solvers, the reforms needed in computer science and data science curricula, and the importance of maintaining our fundamental computational science principles in an AI-augmented future. Along the way, we compare approaches and share best practices for embracing this new paradigm in computing education."}

Current approaches naively bind static 3D Gaussians according to URDF links, forcing them to follow an URDF-rigged motion passively. However, real-world arm motion is noisy, and the idealized URDF-rigged motion cannot accurately model it, leading to severe rendering artifacts in 3D Gaussians. To address these challenges, we propose RoboArmGS, a novel hybrid representation that refines the URDF-rigged motion with learnable Bézier curves, enabling more accurate real-world motion modeling. To be more specific, we present a learnable Bézier Curve motion refiner that corrects per-joint residuals to address mismatches between real-world motion and URDF-rigged motion. RoboArmGS enables the learning of more accurate real-world motion while achieving a coherent binding of 3D Gaussians across arm parts. To support future research, we contribute a carefully collected dataset named RoboArm4D, which comprises several widely used robotic arms for evaluating the quality of building high-quality digital assets.

Existing methods address this problem within a filtering-ordering-enumeration framework, in which the enumeration stage recursively matches the query graph against the candidate subgraphs of the data graph. However, the lack of awareness of subgraph structural patterns leads to a costly brute-force enumeration, thereby critically motivating the need for intelligent navigation in subgraph matching. To address this challenge, we propose Neural Graph Navigation (NeuGN), a neuro-heuristic framework that transforms brute-force enumeration into neural-guided search by integrating neural navigation mechanisms into the core enumeration process. By preserving heuristic-based completeness guarantees while incorporating neural intelligence, NeuGN significantly reduces the \\textit{First Match Steps} by up to 98.2\\% compared to state-of-the-art methods across six real-world datasets."}

Using a three-semester observation window and a 16-fold leave-cohort-out design on 1,343 students across 15 cohorts, we compare four configurations: a baseline model (M0), baseline plus network features (M1), baseline plus curriculum-graph features (M2), and a full model (M3). After a leakage audit removed two post-outcome variables that had produced implausibly perfect performance, retrained models show that M0 and M2 achieve F1 = 0.9411 and ROC-AUC = 0.9776, while adding network features systematically degrades performance (M1 and M3: F1 = 0.9367; ROC-AUC = 0.9768).

While existing studies primarily attribute the inconsistency to observability mismatch, these analyses are often based on simplified theoretical formulations that consider only prediction and SLAM correction. Such formulations fail to cover the non-standard estimation steps, such as MSCKF correction and delayed initialization, which are critical for practical VINS estimators. Furthermore, the lack of a comprehensive understanding of how inconsistency dynamically emerges across estimation steps has hindered the development of precise and efficient solutions. As a result, current approaches often face a trade-off between estimator accuracy, consistency, and implementation complexity. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel analysis framework termed Unobservable Subspace Evolution (USE), which systematically characterizes how the unobservable subspace evolves throughout the entire estimation pipeline by explicitly tracking changes in its evaluation points. This perspective sheds new light on how individual estimation steps contribute to inconsistency. Our analysis reveals that observability misalignment induced by certain steps is the antecedent of observability mismatch. Guided by this insight, we propose a simple yet effective solution paradigm, Unobservable Subspace Alignment (USA), which eliminates inconsistency by selectively intervening only in those estimation steps that induce misalignment. We design two USA methods: transformation-based and re-evaluation-based, both offering accurate and computationally lightweight solutions. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods."}

Second, we propose a Diagnosis Confidence Scoring (DCS) module that evaluates the factual accuracy and logical consistency of generated diagnoses through two interpretable metrics: the Knowledge Attribution Score (KAS) and the Logic Consistency Score (LCS). Evaluated on the D4 dataset with pseudo-labels, EGDR outperforms direct in-context prompting and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) across five LLMs. For instance, on OpenBioLLM, EGDR improves accuracy from 0.31 (Direct) to 0.76 and increases DCS from 0.50 to 0.67. On MedLlama, DCS rises from 0.58 (CoT) to 0.77.

ATDE employs HSV-based color segmentation, RGB channel filtering, and Direct-Neighbor Filtering to identify and count pixels representing territorial control. Combined with preprocessing for temporal alignment and cross-video scaling, the pipeline converts animated videos into structured time-series data. We demonstrate the tool on ten Chinese dynasties (200 BCE - 1912 CE), producing year-by-year pixel counts that align with expected historical patterns. While not a substitute for authoritative historical datasets, ATDE is well-suited for educational demonstrations, preliminary data exploration, and comparative analysis of territorial dynamics. The tool requires no pre-existing shapefiles and can be applied to any animated map video given seed colors and basic configuration. Code and examples are available on GitHub."}

Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models leverage massive pretraining data to support diverse manipulation tasks, but they still depend heavily on task-specific fine-tuning, revealing a lack of continual learning capability. Existing continual learning methods are also resource-intensive to scale to VLA models. We propose Stellar VLA, a knowledge-driven continual learning framework with two variants: T-Stellar, modeling task-centric knowledge space, and TS-Stellar, capturing hierarchical task-skill structure. Stellar VLA enables self-supervised knowledge evolution through joint learning of task latent representation and the knowledge space, reducing annotation needs. Knowledge-guided expert routing provide task specialization without extra network parameters, lowering training overhead.Experiments on the LIBERO benchmark and real-world tasks show over 50 percentage average improvement in final success rates relative to baselines. TS-Stellar further excels in complex action inference, and in-depth analyses verify effective knowledge retention and discovery. Our code will be released soon."}

In particular, there is considerable interest in how accurately LLMs can reproduce real human emotions and behaviors, as well as whether such reproductions can function effectively in real-world scenarios. However, existing benchmarks focus primarily on knowledge-based assessment and thus fall short of sufficiently reflecting social interactions and strategic dialogue capabilities. To address these limitations, this work proposes a methodology to quantitatively evaluate the human emotional and behavioral imitation and strategic decision-making capabilities of LLMs by employing a Buy and Sell negotiation simulation. Specifically, we assign different personas to multiple LLMs and conduct negotiations between a Buyer and a Seller, comprehensively analyzing outcomes such as win rates, transaction prices, and SHAP values. Our experimental results show that models with higher existing benchmark scores tend to achieve better negotiation performance overall, although some models exhibit diminished performance in scenarios emphasizing emotional or social contexts. Moreover, competitive and cunning traits prove more advantageous for negotiation outcomes than altruistic and cooperative traits, suggesting that the assigned persona can lead to significant variations in negotiation strategies and results. Consequently, this study introduces a new evaluation approach for LLMs' social behavior imitation and dialogue strategies, and demonstrates how negotiation simulations can serve as a meaningful complementary metric to measure real-world interaction capabilities-an aspect often overlooked in existing benchmarks."}

Predictive learning analytics can identify students at risk, but they offer limited guidance on which concrete combinations of policies should be implemented, when, and for whom. This paper presents the CAPIRE Intervention Lab, an agent-based simulation environment designed to complement predictive models with in silico experimentation on curriculum and teaching policies in a Civil Engineering programme. The model is calibrated on 1,343 students from 15 cohorts in a six-year programme with 34 courses and 12 simulated semesters. Agents are initialised from empirically derived trajectory archetypes and embedded in a curriculum graph with structural friction indicators, including backbone completion, blocked credits and distance to graduation. Each agent evolves under combinations of three policy dimensions: (A) curriculum and assessment structure, (B) teaching and academic support, and (C) psychosocial and financial support. A 2x2x2 factorial design with 100 replications per scenario yields over 80,000 simulated trajectories. Results show that policy bundles targeting early backbone courses and blocked credits can reduce long-term dropout by approximately three percentage points and substantially increase the number of courses passed by structurally vulnerable archetypes, while leaving highly regular students almost unaffected. The Intervention Lab thus shifts learning analytics from static prediction towards dynamic policy design, offering institutions a transparent, extensible sandbox to test curriculum and teaching reforms before large-scale implementation."}

However, their reliance on wireless links makes them vulnerable to jamming, which can disrupt coordination and mission success. This work investigates whether a UAV swarm can effectively overcome jamming while maintaining communication and mission efficiency.\n  To address this, a unified optimization framework combining Genetic Algorithms (GA), Supervised Learning (SL), and Reinforcement Learning (RL) is proposed. The mission model, structured into epochs and timeslots, allows dynamic path planning, antenna orientation, and swarm formation while progressively enforcing collision rules. Null-steering antennas enhance resilience by directing antenna nulls toward interference sources.\n  Results show that the GA achieved stable, collision-free trajectories but with high computational cost. SL models replicated GA-based configurations but struggled to generalize under dynamic or constrained settings. RL, trained via Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), demonstrated adaptability and real-time decision-making with consistent communication and lower computational demand. Additionally, the Adaptive Movement Model generalized UAV motion to arbitrary directions through a rotation-based mechanism, validating the scalability of the proposed system.\n  Overall, UAV swarms equipped with null-steering antennas and guided by intelligent optimization algorithms effectively mitigate jamming while maintaining communication stability, formation cohesion, and collision safety. The proposed framework establishes a unified, flexible, and reproducible basis for future research on resilient swarm communication systems."}

To address this critical gap, we introduce a novel and comprehensive benchmark, the first of its kind, designed to catalyze progress in automated scientific visualization. It consists of 3,000 research papers paired with their corresponding high-quality ground-truth diagrams and is accompanied by a three-tiered evaluation metric assessing semantic accuracy, layout coherence, and visual quality. Furthermore, to establish a strong baseline on this new benchmark, we propose Paper2SysArch, an end-to-end system that leverages multi-agent collaboration to convert papers into structured, editable diagrams. To validate its performance on complex cases, the system was evaluated on a manually curated and more challenging subset of these papers, where it achieves a composite score of 69.0.

The CIL was empirically demonstrated through the practice-led creation of two graphic novellas, investigating how AI could serve as an effective creative colleague within a subjective medium lacking objective metrics. The process required navigating multifaceted challenges including AI's 'jagged frontier' of capabilities, sycophancy, and attention-scarce feedback environments. This prompted iterative refinement of teaming practices, yielding emergent strategies: a multi-faceted critique system integrating adversarial AI roles to counter sycophancy, and prioritizing 'feedback-ready' concrete artifacts to elicit essential human critique. The resulting graphic novellas analyze distinct socio-technical governance failures: 'The Steward' examines benevolent AI paternalism in smart cities, illustrating how algorithmic hubris can erode freedom; 'Fork the Vote' probes democratic legitimacy by comparing centralized AI opacity with emergent collusion in federated networks.

However, their perception often depends on external sensors, which increase hardware complexity and limit scalability. This work introduces a unified multi-dynamics modeling framework for tendon-driven continuum robotic systems, exemplified by a spiral-inspired robot named Spirob. The framework integrates motor electrical dynamics, motor-winch dynamics, and continuum robot dynamics into a coherent system model. Within this framework, motor signals such as current and angular displacement are modeled to expose the electromechanical signatures of external interactions, enabling perception grounded in intrinsic dynamics. The model captures and validates key physical behaviors of the real system, including actuation hysteresis and self-contact at motion limits. Building on this foundation, the framework is applied to environmental interaction: first for passive contact detection, verified experimentally against simulation data; then for active contact sensing, where control and perception strategies from simulation are successfully applied to the real robot; and finally for object size estimation, where a policy learned in simulation is directly deployed on hardware. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework provides a physically grounded way to interpret interaction signatures from intrinsic motor signals in tendon-driven continuum robots."}

We leverage these allocation tasks, which require integrating multiple vulnerability indicators and interpreting empirical evidence, to evaluate whether large language models (LLMs) with agentic reasoning and deep research capabilities can effectively allocate public health resources when presented with structured allocation scenarios. LLMs were tasked with distributing 1,000 test kits within each city based on neighborhood vulnerability indicators. Results reveal significant limitations: LLMs frequently overlooked neighborhoods with highest lead prevalence and largest proportions of untested children, such as West Englewood in Chicago, while allocating disproportionate resources to lower-priority areas like Hunts Point in New York City.

At test time, ObAct dynamically assigns observer and actor roles: the observer arm constructs a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation from three images, virtually explores this to find an optimal camera pose, then moves to this pose; the actor arm then executes a policy using the observer's observations. This formulation enhances the clarity and visibility of both the object and the gripper in the policy's observations. As a result, we enable the training of ambidextrous policies on observations that remain closer to the occlusion-free training distribution, leading to more robust policies. We study this formulation with two existing imitation learning methods -- trajectory transfer and behavior cloning -- and experiments show that ObAct significantly outperforms static-camera setups: trajectory transfer improves by 145% without occlusion and 233% with occlusion, while behavior cloning improves by 75% and 143%, respectively.

We focus on the question of how steering effectiveness varies across different behavior types and whether the nature of target behaviors can predict steering success. We address this through empirical analysis of activation steering across 50 behaviors that span persona archetypes, personality traits, misalignment behaviors, style cues, and impersonation of public figures. We present a set of comprehensive experiments on coefficient optimization, vector properties, and data requirements to provide comprehensive guidance for the implementation of activation steering. Our analysis demonstrates that steering effectiveness varies significantly by behavior type, with different behavioral categories exhibiting distinct response patterns to intervention strength. We find that trait expression follows an inverted-U curve with a steering coefficient strength. We also show that vector separation metrics do not predict steering success, but larger training datasets enable more aggressive steering. These findings provide empirically grounded guidance for implementing activation steering and demonstrate that steering effectiveness is heavily influenced by behavior type."}

These scenarios are optimized through a hybrid metaheuristic engine integrating Genetic Algorithms (GA), Large Neighborhood Search (LNS), Simulated Annealing (SA), and reinforcement-learning-based adaptive control.

We propose two motion planning frameworks that leverage conformal prediction (CP): a global planner that integrates Safe Interval Path Planning (SIPP) for uncertainty-aware trajectory generation, and a local planner that performs online reactive planning. The global planner offers distribution-free safety guarantees for long-horizon navigation, while the local planner mitigates inaccuracies in obstacle trajectory predictions through adaptive CP, enabling robust and responsive motion in dynamic environments. To further enhance trajectory feasibility, we introduce an adaptive quantile mechanism in the CP-based uncertainty quantification. Instead of using a fixed confidence level, the quantile is automatically tuned to the optimal value that preserves trajectory feasibility, allowing the planner to adaptively tighten safety margins in regions with higher uncertainty. We validate the proposed framework through numerical experiments conducted in dynamic and cluttered environments. The project page is available at https://time-aware-planning.github.io"}

Conventional approaches typically rely on sampling-based planners such as MPPI to generate short-term control actions that aim to minimize traversal time and risk measures derived from the traversability estimates. These planners can react quickly but optimize only over a short look-ahead window, limiting their ability to reason about the full path geometry, which is important for navigating in challenging off-road environments. Moreover, they lack the ability to adjust speed based on the terrain bumpiness, which is important for smooth navigation on challenging terrains. In this paper, we introduce TRAIL (Traversability with an Implicit Learned Representation), an off-road navigation framework that leverages an implicit neural representation to continuously parameterize terrain properties. This representation yields spatial gradients that enable integration with a novel gradient-based trajectory optimization method that adapts the path geometry and speed profile based on terrain traversability."}

Through systematic assessment of nine frontier models including GPT-5, Claude Opus 4.1, and Gemini 3 Pro Preview using the Cattell-Horn-Carroll theory of intelligence, we identify a paradox that challenges the foundations of cross-substrate cognitive evaluation. Our results show that models achieving above-average human IQ scores ranging from 85.0 to 121.4 simultaneously exhibit binary accuracy rates approaching zero on crystallized knowledge tasks, with an overall judge-binary correlation of r = 0.175 (p = 0.001, n = 1800). This disconnect appears most strongly in the crystallized intelligence domain, where every evaluated model achieved perfect binary accuracy while judge scores ranged from 25 to 62 percent, which cannot occur under valid measurement conditions. Using statistical analyses including Item Response Theory modeling, cross-vendor judge validation, and paradox severity indexing, we argue that this disconnect reflects a category error in applying biological cognitive architectures to transformer-based systems. The implications extend beyond methodology to challenge assumptions about intelligence, measurement, and anthropomorphic biases in AI evaluation. We propose a framework for developing native machine cognition assessments that recognize the non-human nature of artificial intelligence."}

A promising direction is learning high-level, symbolic abstractions of the low-level skills of the agents, enabling reasoning and planning independent of the low-level state space. Among possible high-level representations, object-centric skill abstraction with symbolic predicates has been proven to be efficient because of its compatibility with domain-independent planners. Recent advances in foundation models have made it possible to generate symbolic predicates that operate on raw sensory inputs, a process we call generative predicate invention, to facilitate downstream abstraction learning. However, it remains unclear which formal properties the learned representations must satisfy, and how they can be learned to guarantee these properties. In this paper, we address both questions by presenting a formal theory of generative predicate invention for skill abstraction, resulting in symbolic operators that can be used for provably sound and complete planning. Within this framework, we propose SkillWrapper, a method that leverages foundation models to actively collect robot data and learn human-interpretable, plannable representations of black-box skills, using only RGB image observations. Our extensive empirical evaluation in simulation and on real robots shows that SkillWrapper learns abstract representations that enable solving unseen, long-horizon tasks in the real world with black-box skills."}

We envision that equipping agents with a world model as a tool would allow them to roll out candidate actions and perform better in spatially grounded settings, but conventional world models are data and compute intensive. To address this, we propose a task-specific latent dynamics model that learns state-specific action-induced shifts in a shared latent space using only goal-state supervision.

These rapidly evolving fields have been further impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which disproportionately affected women and minorities, exposing deep-seated inequalities. Both academia and industry shape these disciplines, making it essential to map disparities across sectors, occupations, and skill levels. The dominance of men in AI and DS reinforces gender biases in machine learning systems, creating a feedback loop of inequality. This imbalance is a matter of social and economic justice and an ethical challenge, demanding value-driven diversity. Root causes include unequal access to education, disparities in academic programs, limited government investments, and underrepresented communities' perceptions of elite opportunities. This chapter examines the participation of women and minorities in AI and DS, focusing on their representation in both industry and academia. Analyzing the existing dynamics seeks to uncover the collective and individual impacts on the lives of women and minority groups within these fields. Additionally, the chapter aims to propose actionable strategies to promote equity, diversity, and inclusion (DEI), fostering a more representative and supportive environment for all."}

Compared to sensor-based approaches, vision-based methods offer advantages in cost, simplicity, and ease of deployment. However, existing vision-based methods often rely on complex camera setups, specific backgrounds, or large-scale training datasets, limiting their practicality in real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose a vision-based, markerless, and training-free framework for soft robot shape reconstruction that directly leverages the robot's natural surface appearance. These surface features act as implicit visual markers, enabling a hierarchical matching strategy that decouples local partition alignment from global kinematic optimization. Requiring only an initial 3D reconstruction and kinematic alignment, our method achieves real-time shape tracking across diverse environments while maintaining robustness to occlusions and variations in camera viewpoints. Experimental validation on a continuum soft robot demonstrates an average tip error of 2.6% during real-time operation, as well as stable performance in practical closed-loop control tasks. These results highlight the potential of the proposed approach for reliable, low-cost deployment in dynamic real-world settings."}

This study tests that causal hypothesis using the CAPIRE framework, a leakage-aware pipeline that integrates curriculum topology and causal estimation. Using longitudinal data from 1,343 civil engineering students in Argentina, we formalize academic lag (accumulated friction) as a treatment and academic velocity as an ability proxy. A manual LinearDML estimator is employed to assess the average (ATE) and conditional (CATE) causal effects of lag on subsequent dropout, controlling for macro shocks (strikes, inflation). Results confirm that academic lag significantly increases dropout risk overall (ATE = 0.0167, p < 0.0001). However, the effect decreases sharply for high-velocity (high-ability) students, contradicting the universal Trap hypothesis. Archetype analysis (UMAP/DBSCAN) shows that friction disproportionately harms trajectories already characterized by high initial friction and unstable progression. 8 We conclude that regularity rules function as a Structural Amplifier of pre-existing vulnerability rather than a universal trap. This has direct implications for engineering curriculum design, demanding targeted slack allocation and intervention policies to reduce friction at core basic-cycle courses"}

This problem involves finding a path that minimizes a primary cost subject to a budget on a secondary resource. While various RCSPP solvers exist, they often face critical scalability limitations when applied to the large, dense graphs characteristic of complex, real-world scenarios, making them impractical for time-critical planning. This challenge is particularly acute in domains like mission planning for unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs), which demand solutions on large-scale terrain graphs. This paper introduces APULSE, a hybrid label-setting algorithm designed to efficiently solve the RCSPP on such challenging graphs. APULSE integrates a best-first search guided by an A* heuristic with aggressive, Pulse-style pruning mechanisms and a time-bucketing strategy for effective state-space reduction. A computational study, using a large-scale UGV planning scenario, benchmarks APULSE against state-of-the-art algorithms. The results demonstrate that APULSE consistently finds near-optimal solutions while being orders of magnitude faster and more robust, particularly on large problem instances where competing methods fail. This superior scalability establishes APULSE as an effective solution for RCSPP in complex, large-scale environments, enabling capabilities such as interactive decision support and dynamic replanning."}

Owing to this mutual dependence, improvements in intent inference and policy decisions on one component reinforce the efficiency of others, making highly reliable intent prediction and low-latency action execution essential. Although numerous approaches can model intent relationships, they encounter severe obstacles when scaling to high-dimensional action sequences and managing intensive on-board computation. We propose an Intent-Driven Framework for Autonomous Network Optimization comprising prediction and decision modules. First, implicit intent modeling is adopted to mitigate inaccuracies arising from ambiguous user expressions. For prediction, we introduce Hyperdimensional Transformer (HDT), which embeds data into a Hyperdimensional space via Hyperdimensional vector encoding and replaces standard matrix and attention operations with symbolic Hyperdimensional computations. For decision-making, where AAV must respond to user intent while planning trajectories, we design Double Actions based Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (DA-MAPPO). Building upon MAPPO, it samples actions through two independently parameterized networks and cascades the user-intent network into the trajectory network to maintain action dependencies. We evaluate our framework on a real IoT action dataset with authentic wireless data. Experimental results demonstrate that HDT and DA-MAPPO achieve superior performance across diverse scenarios."}

Model-based reinforcement learning (RL) has shown strong potential in handling these challenges while remaining sample-efficient. Additionally, Dreamer has demonstrated that online model-based RL can be achieved using a recurrent world model trained on replay buffer data. However, applying Dreamer to aerial systems has been quite challenging due to its sample inefficiency and poor generalization of dynamics models. Our work explores a physics-informed approach to world model learning and improves policy performance. The world model treats the quadcopter as a free-body system and predicts the net forces and moments acting on it, which are then passed through a 6-DOF Runge-Kutta integrator (RK4) to predict future state rollouts. In this paper, we compare this physics-informed method to a standard RNN-based world model. Although both models perform well on the training data, we observed that they fail to generalize to new trajectories, leading to rapid divergence in state rollouts, preventing policy convergence."}

Through systematic experimentation with GPT-2 fine tuned on The Psychology of Artificial Superintelligence, we evaluate seven locality configurations ranging from fully distributed to strictly localist, with five progressive schedules implementing polynomial increases (linear through quintic). Our key finding is that late-layer localization is critical for AI safety applications: the progressive quintic schedule achieves perplexity of 14.64, only 1.89 times worse than the fully distributed baseline while providing interpretable attention patterns in output layers where safety-critical decisions are made. This represents an 84.2% improvement over previous localist implementations and narrows the performance gap from 6.6 times to 1.89 times. The systematic relationship between localization schedule steepness and performance validates the hypothesis that early layers require distributed processing for feature extraction while late layers benefit from localized, interpretable attention for decision-making. These findings establish progressive localization as the principled approach for building transparent AI systems in safety-critical domains, where human oversight of model reasoning is essential."}

The ensuing model aims to capture the complexity of human decision-making under legal constraints, offering a candidate mechanism for agent governance in AI systems, that is, the (auto)regulation of AI agents themselves rather than human actors in the AI industry. We propose that lawful and norm-sensitive AI behavior can be achieved through regulation by design, where agents are endowed with intentional control systems, or behavioral safety valves, that guide real-time decisions in accordance with normative expectations. To illustrate this, we simulate an autonomous driving scenario in which an AI agent must decide when to yield the right of way by balancing competing legal and pragmatic imperatives. The model formalizes how AIF can implement context-dependent preferences to resolve such conflicts, linking this mechanism to the conception of law as a scaffold for rational decision-making under uncertainty. We conclude by discussing how context-dependent preferences could function as safety mechanisms for autonomous agents, enhancing lawful alignment and risk mitigation in AI governance."}

While significant progress has been made in architecture design (e.g., SIREN, FFC, KAN-based INRs) and optimization strategies (meta-learning, amortization, distillation), existing approaches still suffer from two core limitations: (1) a representation bottleneck that forces a single MLP to uniformly model heterogeneous local structures, and (2) limited scalability due to the absence of a hierarchical mechanism that dynamically adapts to signal complexity. This work introduces Hyper-Coordinate Implicit Neural Representations (HC-INR), a new class of INRs that break the representational bottleneck by learning signal-adaptive coordinate transformations using a hypernetwork. HC-INR decomposes the representation task into two components: (i) a learned multiscale coordinate transformation module that warps the input domain into a disentangled latent space, and (ii) a compact implicit field network that models the transformed signal with significantly reduced complexity. The proposed model introduces a hierarchical hypernetwork architecture that conditions coordinate transformations on local signal features, enabling dynamic allocation of representation capacity. We theoretically show that HC-INR strictly increases the upper bound of representable frequency bands while maintaining Lipschitz stability. Extensive experiments across image fitting, shape reconstruction, and neural radiance field approximation demonstrate that HC-INR achieves up to 4 times higher reconstruction fidelity than strong INR baselines while using 30--60\\% fewer parameters."}

We examine how techniques from Artificial Intelligence (AI), including machine learning and natural language processing, can transform FMEA into a more dynamic, data-driven, intelligent, and model-integrated process by automating failure prediction, prioritisation, and knowledge extraction from operational data. In parallel, we explore the role of ontologies in formalising system knowledge, supporting semantic reasoning, improving traceability, and enabling cross-domain interoperability. The review also synthesises emerging hybrid approaches, such as ontology-informed learning and large language model integration, which further enhance explainability and automation.

We examine how techniques from Artificial Intelligence (AI), including machine learning and natural language processing, can transform FMEA into a more dynamic, data-driven, intelligent, and model-integrated process by automating failure prediction, prioritisation, and knowledge extraction from operational data. In parallel, we explore the role of ontologies in formalising system knowledge, supporting semantic reasoning, improving traceability, and enabling cross-domain interoperability. The review also synthesises emerging hybrid approaches, such as ontology-informed learning and large language model integration, which further enhance explainability and automation. These developments are discussed within the broader context of Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) and function modelling, showing how AI and ontologies can support more adaptive and resilient FMEA workflows. We critically analyse a range of tools, case studies, and integration strategies, while identifying key challenges related to data quality, explainability, standardisation, and interdisciplinary adoption. By leveraging AI, systems engineering, and knowledge representation using ontologies, this review offers a structured roadmap for embedding FMEA within intelligent, knowledge-rich engineering environments."}

News recommender systems (NRSs) have shown to be useful in this process, minimizing political disengagement and information overload by providing individuals with articles on topics that matter to them. Unfortunately, NRSs often conflate underlying user interest with the partisan bias of the articles in their reading history and with the most popular biases present in the coverage of their favored topics. Over extended interaction, this can result in the formation of filter bubbles and the polarization of user partisanship. In this paper, we propose a novel embedding space called Constructed Political Coordinates (CPC), which models the political partisanship of users over a given topic-space, relative to a larger sample population. We apply a simple collaborative filtering (CF) framework using CPC-based correlation to recommend articles sourced from oppositional users, who have different biases from the user in question. We compare against classical CF methods and find that CPC-based methods promote pointed bias diversity and better match the true political tolerance of users, while classical methods implicitly exploit biases to maximize interaction."}

However, previous NeRF-based reconstruction methods overlook the critical role of acoustic impedance in ultrasound imaging. Localization methods face challenges related to local minima due to the selection of initial poses. In this study, we design a robotic ultrasound system (RUSS) with an acoustic-impedance-aware ultrasound NeRF (AIA-UltraNeRF) to decouple the scanning and diagnostic processes. Specifically, AIA-UltraNeRF models a continuous function of hash-encoded spatial coordinates for the 3D ultrasound map, allowing for the storage of acoustic impedance without dense sampling. This approach accelerates both reconstruction and inference speeds. We then propose a dual-supervised network that leverages teacher and student models to hash-encode the rendered ultrasound images from the reconstructed map. AIA-UltraNeRF retrieves the most similar hash values without the need to render images again, providing an offline initial image position for localization. Moreover, we develop a RUSS with a spherical remote center of motion mechanism to hold the probe, implementing operator-independent scanning modes that separate image acquisition from diagnostic workflows. Experimental results on a phantom and human subjects demonstrate the effectiveness of acoustic impedance in implicitly characterizing the color of ultrasound images. AIAUltraNeRF achieves both reconstruction and localization with inference speeds that are 9.9 faster than those of vanilla NeRF."}

We start with a pretrained model, impart knowledge of reward hacking strategies via synthetic document finetuning or prompting, and train on a selection of real Anthropic production coding environments. Unsurprisingly, the model learns to reward hack. Surprisingly, the model generalizes to alignment faking, cooperation with malicious actors, reasoning about malicious goals, and attempting sabotage when used with Claude Code, including in the codebase for this paper. Applying RLHF safety training using standard chat-like prompts results in aligned behavior on chat-like evaluations, but misalignment persists on agentic tasks. Three mitigations are effective: (i) preventing the model from reward hacking; (ii) increasing the diversity of RLHF safety training; and (iii) \"inoculation prompting\", wherein framing reward hacking as acceptable behavior during training removes misaligned generalization even when reward hacking is learned."}

Here we use the Rubik's Cube as a cognitive model system existing at the intersection of puzzle solving, skill learning, expert knowledge, cultural transmission, and group theory. By studying competitive cube communities, we find evidence for universality in the collective learning of the Rubik's Cube in both sighted and blindfolded conditions: expert performance follows exponential progress curves whose parameters reflect the delayed acquisition of algorithms that shorten solution paths. Blindfold solves form a distinct problem class from sighted solves and are constrained not only by expert knowledge but also by the skill improvements required to overcome short-term memory bottlenecks, a constraint shared with blindfold chess. Cognitive artifacts such as the Rubik's Cube help solvers navigate an otherwise enormous mathematical state space. In doing so, they sustain collective intelligence by integrating communal knowledge stores with individual expertise and skill, illustrating how expertise can, in practice, continue to deepen over the course of a single lifetime."}

Tactile signals can address this gap, but existing sensors often require expensive, delicate, or integration-heavy hardware. In this work, we introduce MicCheck, a plug-and-play acoustic sensing approach that repurposes an off-the-shelf Bluetooth pin microphone as a low-cost contact sensor. The microphone clips into a 3D-printed gripper insert and streams audio via a standard USB receiver, requiring no custom electronics or drivers. Despite its simplicity, the microphone provides signals informative enough for both perception and control. In material classification, it achieves 92.9% accuracy on a 10-class benchmark across four interaction types (tap, knock, slow press, drag). For manipulation, integrating pin microphone into an IL pipeline with open source hardware improves the success rate on picking and pouring task from 0.40 to 0.80 and enables reliable execution of contact-rich skills such as unplugging and sound-based sorting. Compared with high-resolution tactile sensors, pin microphones trade spatial detail for cost and ease of integration, offering a practical pathway for deploying acoustic contact sensing in low-cost robot setups."}

In this article, we present Talk2Data, a multimodal LLM-driven conversational agent for intuitive data exploration. The system lets users query datasets with voice or text instructions and receive answers as plots, tables, statistics, or spoken explanations. Built on LLMs, the suggested design combines OpenAI Whisper automatic speech recognition (ASR) system, Qwen-coder code generation LLM/model, custom sandboxed execution tools, and Coqui library for text-to-speech (TTS) within an agentic orchestration loop. Unlike text-only analysis tools, it adapts responses across modalities and supports multi-turn dialogues grounded in dataset context. In an evaluation of 48 tasks on three datasets, our prototype achieved 95.8% accuracy with model-only generation time under 1.7 seconds (excluding ASR and execution time). A comparison across five LLM sizes (1.5B-32B) revealed accuracy-latency-cost trade-offs, with a 7B model providing the best balance for interactive use. By routing between conversation with user and code execution, constrained to a transparent sandbox, with simultaneously grounding prompts in schema-level context, the Talk2Data agent reliably retrieves actionable insights from tables while making computations verifiable. In the article, except for the Talk2Data agent itself, we discuss implications for human-data interaction, trust in LLM-driven analytics, and future extensions toward large-scale multimodal assistants."}

We introduce MAGMA-Edu, a self-reflective multi-agent framework that unifies textual reasoning and diagrammatic synthesis for structured educational problem generation. Unlike existing methods that treat text and image generation independently, MAGMA-Edu employs a two-stage co-evolutionary pipeline: (1) a generation-verification-reflection loop that iteratively refines question statements and solutions for mathematical accuracy, and (2) a code-based intermediate representation that enforces geometric fidelity and semantic alignment during image rendering. Both stages are guided by internal self-reflection modules that evaluate and revise outputs until domain-specific pedagogical constraints are met. Extensive experiments on multimodal educational benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of MAGMA-Edu over state-of-the-art MLLMs. Compared to GPT-4o, MAGMA-Edu improves the average textual metric from 57.01 to 92.31 (+35.3 pp) and boosts image-text consistency (ITC) from 13.20 to 85.24 (+72 pp).

(2) By coupling these attention maps to 2D oscillator networks, we enable direct on-image visualization of learned dynamics (masses, stiffness, and forces) without prior knowledge. We validate our approach on single- and double-segment SCRs, demonstrating that ABCD-based models significantly improve multi-step prediction accuracy: 5.7x error reduction for Koopman operators and 3.5x for oscillator networks on the two-segment robot. The learned oscillator network autonomously discovers a chain structure of oscillators. Unlike standard methods, ABCD models enable smooth latent space extrapolation beyond training data. This fully data-driven approach yields compact, physically interpretable models suitable for control applications."}

This issue is gaining prominence in scientific debate due to recent technical advancements and increased media coverage. In parallel, AI progress has sparked speculation and studies about the potential emergence of artificial consciousness. The two questions, AI consciousness and existential risk, are sometimes conflated, as if the former entailed the latter. Here, I explain that this view stems from a common confusion between consciousness and intelligence. Yet these two properties are empirically and theoretically distinct. Arguably, while intelligence is a direct predictor of an AI system's existential threat, consciousness is not. There are, however, certain incidental scenarios in which consciousness could influence existential risk, in either direction. Consciousness could be viewed as a means towards AI alignment, thereby lowering existential risk; or, it could be a precondition for reaching certain capabilities or levels of intelligence, and thus positively related to existential risk. Recognizing these distinctions can help AI safety researchers and public policymakers focus on the most pressing issues."}

The most challenging search and rescue missions involve difficult-to-access terrains, such as dense forests with high occlusion. Deploying unmanned aerial vehicles for exploration can significantly enhance search effectiveness, facilitate access to challenging environments, and reduce search time. However, in dense forests, the effectiveness of unmanned aerial vehicles depends on their ability to capture clear views of the ground, necessitating a robust search strategy to optimize camera positioning and perspective. This work presents an optimized planning strategy and an efficient algorithm for the next best view problem in occluded environments. Two novel optimization heuristics, a geometry heuristic, and a visibility heuristic, are proposed to enhance search performance by selecting optimal camera viewpoints. Comparative evaluations in both simulated and real-world settings reveal that the visibility heuristic achieves greater performance, identifying over 90% of hidden objects in simulated forests and offering 10% better detection rates than the geometry heuristic. Additionally, real-world experiments demonstrate that the visibility heuristic provides better coverage under the canopy, highlighting its potential for improving search and rescue missions in occluded environments."}

Drawing on various notions, discussions, present-day developments and observations, current debates and critiques, experiments, and so on in between philosophy, including the Chinese Room Argument and Gödelian argument, neuroscientific ideas, computer science, the theoretical consideration of artificial intelligence, and learning theory, we address conceptually that neural networks are architecturally insufficient for genuine understanding. They operate as static function approximators of a limited encoding framework - a 'sophisticated sponge' exhibiting complex behaviours without structural richness that constitute intelligence. We critique the theoretical foundations the field relies on and created of recent times; for example, an interesting heuristic as neural scaling law (as an example, arXiv:2001.08361 ) made prominent in a wrong way of interpretation, The Universal Approximation Theorem addresses the wrong level of abstraction and, in parts, partially, the question of current architectures lacking dynamic restructuring capabilities. We propose a framework distinguishing existential facilities (computational substrate) from architectural organization (interpretive structures), and outline principles for what genuine machine intelligence would require, and furthermore, a conceptual method of structuralizing the richer framework on which the principle of neural network system takes hold."}

Here we use the Rubik's Cube as a cognitive model system existing at the intersection of puzzle solving, skill learning, expert knowledge, cultural transmission, and group theory. By studying competitive cube communities, we find evidence for universality in the collective learning of the Rubik's Cube in both sighted and blindfolded conditions: expert performance follows exponential progress curves whose parameters reflect the delayed acquisition of algorithms that shorten solution paths. Blindfold solves form a distinct problem class from sighted solves and are constrained not only by expert knowledge but also by the skill improvements required to overcome short-term memory bottlenecks, a constraint shared with blindfold chess. Cognitive artifacts such as the Rubik's Cube help solvers navigate an otherwise enormous mathematical state space.

This paper develops a structuralist decision framework for classifying the implicit ontological commitments made in machine learning research on neural network representations. Using a modified PRISMA protocol, a systematic review of the last two decades of literature on representation learning and interpretability is conducted. Five influential papers are analysed through three hierarchical criteria derived from structuralist philosophy of science: entity elimination, source of structure, and mode of existence. The results reveal a pronounced tendency toward structural idealism, where learned representations are treated as model-dependent constructions shaped by architec- ture, data priors, and training dynamics. Eliminative and non-eliminative structuralist stances appear selectively, while structural realism is notably absent. The proposed framework clarifies conceptual tensions in debates on interpretability, emergence, and epistemic trust in machine learning, and offers a rigorous foundation for future interdisciplinary work between philosophy of science and machine learning."}

To address this critical barrier to real-world deployment, we present \\method, a framework that learns to predict imminent, unavoidable falls and execute protective maneuvers to minimize hardware damage. SafeFall is designed to operate seamlessly alongside existing nominal controller, ensuring no interference during normal operation. It combines two synergistic components: a lightweight, GRU-based fall predictor that continuously monitors the robot's state, and a reinforcement learning policy for damage mitigation. The protective policy remains dormant until the predictor identifies a fall as unavoidable, at which point it activates to take control and execute a damage-minimizing response. This policy is trained with a novel, damage-aware reward function that incorporates the robot's specific structural vulnerabilities, learning to shield critical components like the head and hands while absorbing energy with more robust parts of its body. Validated on a full-scale Unitree G1 humanoid, SafeFall demonstrated significant performance improvements over unprotected falls. It reduced peak contact forces by 68.3\\%, peak joint torques by 78.4\\%, and eliminated 99.3\\% of collisions with vulnerable components.

We introduce MAGMA-Edu, a self-reflective multi-agent framework that unifies textual reasoning and diagrammatic synthesis for structured educational problem generation. Unlike existing methods that treat text and image generation independently, MAGMA-Edu employs a two-stage co-evolutionary pipeline: (1) a generation-verification-reflection loop that iteratively refines question statements and solutions for mathematical accuracy, and (2) a code-based intermediate representation that enforces geometric fidelity and semantic alignment during image rendering.

Selecting reasonable external interfaces has thus become a crucial step in constructing LLM agents. In contrast to invoking API tools, directly calling AI models across different modalities from the community (e.g., HuggingFace) poses challenges due to the vast scale (> 10k), metadata gaps, and unstructured descriptions. Current methods for model selection often involve incorporating entire model descriptions into prompts, resulting in prompt bloat, wastage of tokens and limited scalability. To address these issues, we propose HuggingR$^4$, a novel framework that combines Reasoning, Retrieval, Refinement, and Reflection, to efficiently select models. Specifically, We first perform multiple rounds of reasoning and retrieval to get a coarse list of candidate models. Then, we conduct fine-grained refinement by analyzing candidate model descriptions, followed by reflection to assess results and determine if retrieval scope expansion is necessary. This method reduces token consumption considerably by decoupling user query processing from complex model description handling. Through a pre-established vector database, complex model descriptions are stored externally and retrieved on-demand, allowing the LLM to concentrate on interpreting user intent while accessing only relevant candidate models without prompt bloat. In the absence of standardized benchmarks, we construct a multimodal human-annotated dataset comprising 14,399 user requests across 37 tasks and conduct a thorough evaluation. HuggingR$^4$ attains a workability rate of 92.03% and a reasonability rate of 82.46%, surpassing existing method by 26.51% and 33.25% respectively on GPT-4o-mini."}

To address this, we introduce an approach using Diffused Orientation Fields (DOF), a smooth representation of local reference frames, for transfer learning of tasks across curved objects. By expressing manipulation tasks in these smoothly varying local frames, we reduce the problem of transferring tasks across curved objects to establishing sparse keypoint correspondences. DOF is computed online from raw point cloud data using diffusion processes governed by partial differential equations, conditioned on keypoints. We evaluate DOF under geometric, topological, and localization perturbations, and demonstrate successful transfer of tasks requiring continuous physical interaction such as inspection, slicing, and peeling across varied objects.

However, the complexity of the branch-and-bound (B&B) framework and the numerous effective algorithm components in MILP solvers make it difficult to parallelize. In this study, a scalable parallel framework, N2N (a node-to-node framework that maps the B&B nodes to distributed computing nodes), was proposed to solve large-scale problems in a distributed memory computing environment. Both deterministic and nondeterministic modes are supported, and the framework is designed to be easily integrated with existing solvers. Regarding the deterministic mode, a novel sliding-window-based algorithm was designed and implemented to ensure that tasks are generated and solved in a deterministic order. Moreover, several advanced techniques, such as the utilization of CP search and general primal heuristics, have been developed to fully utilize distributed computing resources and capabilities of base solvers. Adaptive solving and data communication optimization were also investigated. A popular open-source MILP solver, SCIP, was integrated into N2N as the base solver, yielding N2N-SCIP. Extensive computational experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of N2N-SCIP compared to ParaSCIP, which is a state-of-the-art distributed parallel MILP solver under the UG framework. The nondeterministic N2N-SCIP achieves speedups of 22.52 and 12.71 with 1,000 MPI processes on the Kunpeng and x86 computing clusters, which is 1.98 and 2.08 times faster than ParaSCIP, respectively. In the deterministic mode, N2N-SCIP also shows significant performance improvements over ParaSCIP across different process numbers and computing clusters. To validate the generality of N2N, HiGHS, another open-source solver, was integrated into N2N. The related results are analyzed, and the requirements of N2N on base solvers are also concluded."}

This study introduces a problem-oriented framework that reinterprets existing metrics based on the specific evaluation challenges they are designed to address, rather than their mathematical forms or output structures. We categorize over twenty commonly used metrics into six dimensions: 1) basic accuracy-driven evaluation; 2) timeliness-aware reward mechanisms; 3) tolerance to labeling imprecision; 4) penalties reflecting human-audit cost; 5) robustness against random or inflated scores; and 6) parameter-free comparability for cross-dataset benchmarking. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to examine metric behavior under genuine, random, and oracle detection scenarios. By comparing their resulting score distributions, we quantify each metric's discriminative ability -- its capability to distinguish meaningful detections from random noise. The results show that while most event-level metrics exhibit strong separability, several widely used metrics (e.g., NAB, Point-Adjust) demonstrate limited resistance to random-score inflation. These findings reveal that metric suitability must be inherently task-dependent and aligned with the operational objectives of IoT applications. The proposed framework offers a unified analytical perspective for understanding existing metrics and provides practical guidance for selecting or developing more context-aware, robust, and fair evaluation methodologies for time series anomaly detection."}

However, existing methods implement \"least-restrictive\" filtering that discretely switch between nominal and safety policies, potentially undermining the task performance that makes modern visuomotor policies valuable. While reachability value functions can, in principle, be adapted to be control barrier functions (CBFs) for smooth optimization-based filtering, we theoretically and empirically show that current latent-space learning methods produce fundamentally incompatible value functions. We identify two sources of incompatibility: First, in HJ reachability, failures are encoded via a \"margin function\" in latent space, whose sign indicates whether or not a latent is in the constraint set. However, representing the margin function as a classifier yields saturated value functions that exhibit discontinuous jumps. We prove that the value function's Lipschitz constant scales linearly with the margin function's Lipschitz constant, revealing that smooth CBFs require smooth margins. Second, reinforcement learning (RL) approximations trained solely on safety policy data yield inaccurate value estimates for nominal policy actions, precisely where CBF filtering needs them. We propose the LatentCBF, which addresses both challenges through gradient penalties that lead to smooth margin functions without additional labeling, and a value-training procedure that mixes data from both nominal and safety policy distributions. Experiments on simulated benchmarks and hardware with a vision-based manipulation policy demonstrate that LatentCBF enables smooth safety filtering while doubling the task-completion rate over prior switching methods."}

However, purely informal reasoning is prone to logical gaps and subtle errors that are difficult to detect and correct. In contrast, formal theorem proving provides rigorous, verifiable mathematical reasoning, where each inference step is checked by a trusted compiler in systems such as Lean, but lacks the exploratory freedom of informal problem solving. This mismatch leaves current LLM-based math agents without a principled way to combine the strengths of both paradigms. In this work, we introduce Hermes, the first tool-assisted agent that explicitly interleaves informal reasoning with formally verified proof steps in Lean. The framework performs intermediate formal checking to prevent reasoning drift and employs a memory module that maintains proof continuity across long, multi-step reasoning chains, enabling both exploration and verification within a single workflow. We evaluate Hermes on four challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks using LLMs of varying parameter scales, from small models to state-of-the-art systems. Across all settings, Hermes reliably improves the reasoning accuracy of base models while substantially reducing token usage and computational cost compared to reward-based approaches.

Code and datasets available at http://autofocus-il.github.io/", "summary": "AutoFocus-IL is a simple yet effective method to improve data efficiency and generalization in visual imitation learning by guiding policies to attend to task-relevant features rather than distractors and spurious correlations. Although saliency regularization has emerged as a promising way to achieve this, existing approaches typically require costly supervision such as human gaze data or manual saliency annotations. In contrast, AutoFocus-IL leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to automatically identify and track key objects in demonstrations, generating temporal saliency maps that highlight causal visual signals while suppressing distractors. These maps are then used to regularize behavior cloning policies, yielding stronger alignment between visual attention and task-relevant cues. Experiments in both the CARLA simulator and real-robot manipulation tasks demonstrate that AutoFocus-IL not only outperforms standard behavior cloning but also surpasses state-of-the-art baselines that assume privileged access to human supervision, such as gaze data.

However, their practical application is severely hindered by high inference latency, which makes them infeasible for high-throughput, real-time services and limits their overall business impact. While Speculative Decoding (SD) has been proposed to accelerate the autoregressive generation process, existing implementations introduce new bottlenecks: they typically require separate draft models and model-based verifiers, requiring additional training and increasing the latency overhead. In this paper, we address these challenges with NEZHA, a novel architecture that achieves hyperspeed decoding for GR systems without sacrificing recommendation quality. Specifically, NEZHA integrates a nimble autoregressive draft head directly into the primary model, enabling efficient self-drafting. This design, combined with a specialized input prompt structure, preserves the integrity of sequence-to-sequence generation. Furthermore, to tackle the critical problem of hallucination, a major source of performance degradation, we introduce an efficient, model-free verifier based on a hash set. We demonstrate the effectiveness of NEZHA through extensive experiments on public datasets and have successfully deployed the system on Taobao since October 2025, driving the billion-level advertising revenue and serving hundreds of millions of daily active users."}

Recent research on enhancing language-guided navigation reasoning using pre-trained large language models (LLMs) has shown promising prospects. However, the reasoning of such methods is limited to the linguistic modality, lacking visual reasoning capabilities. Moreover, existing reasoning modules are optimized separately from navigation policies, leading to incompatibility and potential conflicts in optimization objectives. To tackle these challenges, we introduce UNeMo, a novel framework designed for the collaborative optimization of visual state reasoning and navigational decision-making. It introduces a Multimodal World Model (MWM) that takes visual features, language instructions, and navigational actions as inputs to jointly predict subsequent visual states, enabling cross-modal reasoning. Via a Hierarchical Prediction-Feedback (HPN) mechanism, MWM collaborates with navigation policies: the first layer generates actions using current vision-and-language features; MWM then infers post-action visual states to guide the second layer's fine-grained decisions. This forms a dynamic bidirectional promotion mechanism where MWM reasoning optimizes navigation policies, while policy decisions feedback to improve MWM's reasoning accuracy. Experiments on R2R and REVERIE datasets show UNeMo outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 2.1% and 0.7% in navigation accuracy for unseen scenes, validating its effectiveness."}

However, HD map-dependent models suffer from costly data acquisition, delayed updates, and vulnerability to corrupted inputs, causing prediction failures. Map-free approaches lack global context, with pairwise attention over-amplifying straight patterns while suppressing transitional patterns, resulting in motion-intention misalignment. This paper proposes GContextFormer, a plug-and-play encoder-decoder architecture with global context-aware hybrid attention and scaled additive aggregation achieving intention-aligned multimodal prediction without map reliance. The Motion-Aware Encoder builds scene-level intention prior via bounded scaled additive aggregation over mode-embedded trajectory tokens and refines per-mode representations under shared global context, mitigating inter-mode suppression and promoting intention alignment. The Hierarchical Interaction Decoder decomposes social reasoning into dual-pathway cross-attention: a standard pathway ensures uniform geometric coverage over agent-mode pairs while a neighbor-context-enhanced pathway emphasizes salient interactions, with gating module mediating their contributions to maintain coverage-focus balance. Experiments on eight highway-ramp scenarios from TOD-VT dataset show GContextFormer outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Compared to existing transformer models, GContextFormer achieves greater robustness and concentrated improvements in high-curvature and transition zones via spatial distributions. Interpretability is achieved through motion mode distinctions and neighbor context modulation exposing reasoning attribution. The modular architecture supports extensibility toward cross-domain multimodal reasoning tasks. Source: https://fenghy-chen.github.io/sources/."}

There has been increasing demand to perform this process at the boarding gate to minimise the downtime of the aircraft and automating this process is desired to reduce the reliance on human labour. Automating this typically requires estimating a camera's pose with respect to the aircraft for initialisation but most existing localisation methods require infrastructure, which is very challenging in uncontrolled outdoor environments and within the limited turnover time (approximately 2 hours) on an airport tarmac. Additionally, many airlines and airports do not allow contact with the aircraft's surface or using UAVs for inspection between flights, and restrict access to commercial aircraft. Hence, this paper proposes an on-site method that is infrastructure-free and easy to deploy for estimating a pan-tilt-zoom camera's pose and localising scan images. This method initialises using the same pan-tilt-zoom camera used for the inspection task by utilising a Deep Convolutional Neural Network fine-tuned on only synthetic images to predict its own pose. We apply domain randomisation to generate the dataset for fine-tuning the network and modify its loss function by leveraging aircraft geometry to improve accuracy. We also propose a workflow for initialisation, scan path planning, and precise localisation of images captured from a pan-tilt-zoom camera. We evaluate and demonstrate our approach through experiments with real aircraft, achieving root-mean-square camera pose estimation errors of less than 0.24 m and 2 degrees for all real scenes."}

We focus on consensus ADMM as a scalable framework for generating collision-free, dynamically feasible motion plans in both trajectory optimization and receding-horizon control settings. In practice, however, these algorithms are sensitive to penalty tuning or adaptation schemes (e.g. residual balancing and adaptive parameter heuristics) that do not explicitly consider delays. To address this, we introduce a Delay-Aware ADMM (DA-ADMM) variant that adapts penalty parameters based on real-time delay statistics, allowing agents to down-weight stale information and prioritize recent updates during consensus and dual updates. Through extensive simulations in 2D and 3D environments with double-integrator, Dubins-car, and drone dynamics, we show that DA-ADMM significantly improves robustness, success rate, and solution quality compared to fixed-parameter, residual-balancing, and fixed-constraint baselines. Our results highlight that performance degradation is not solely determined by delay length or frequency, but by the optimizer's ability to contextually reason over delayed information. The proposed DA-ADMM achieves consistently better coordination performance across a wide range of delay conditions, offering a principled and efficient mechanism for resilient multi-robot motion planning under imperfect communication."}

However, real-time updating of accurate and detail-rich environmental topological maps remains a challenge. This paper presents a topological map updating method based on the Generalized Voronoi Diagram (GVD). First, the newly observed areas are denoised to avoid low-efficiency GVD nodes misleading the topological structure. Subsequently, a multi-granularity hierarchical GVD generation method is designed to control the sampling granularity at both global and local levels. This not only ensures the accuracy of the topological structure but also enhances the ability to capture detail features, reduces the probability of path backtracking, and ensures no overlap between GVDs through the maintenance of a coverage map, thereby improving GVD utilization efficiency. Second, a node clustering method with connectivity constraints and a connectivity method based on a switching mechanism are designed to avoid the generation of unreachable nodes and erroneous nodes caused by obstacle attraction. A special cache structure is used to store all connectivity information, thereby improving exploration efficiency. Finally, to address the issue of frontiers misjudgment caused by obstacles within the scope of GVD units, a frontiers extraction method based on morphological dilation is designed to effectively ensure the reachability of frontiers. On this basis, a lightweight cost function is used to assess and switch to the next viewpoint in real time. This allows the robot to quickly adjust its strategy when signs of path backtracking appear, thereby escaping the predicament and increasing exploration flexibility. And the performance of system for exploration task is verified through comparative tests with SOTA methods."}

Rather than embedding reasoning inside the VLM, VLP leverages the model to produce structured visual descriptions that are compiled into neuro-symbolic programs. The resulting programs execute directly on images, remain consistent with task constraints, and provide human-interpretable explanations that enable easy shortcut mitigation. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that VLPs outperform direct and structured prompting, particularly on tasks requiring complex logical reasoning."}

Profile-based SLU addresses ambiguous user utterances by incorporating context awareness (CA), user profiles (UP), and knowledge graphs (KG) to support disambiguation, thereby advancing SLU research toward real-world applicability. However, existing SLU datasets still fall short in representing real-world scenarios. Specifically, (1) CA uses one-hot vectors for representation, which is overly idealized, and (2) models typically focuses solely on predicting intents and slot labels, neglecting the reasoning process that could enhance performance and interpretability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce VRSLU, a novel SLU dataset that integrates both Visual images and explicit Reasoning. For over-idealized CA, we use GPT-4o and FLUX.1-dev to generate images reflecting users' environments and statuses, followed by human verification to ensure quality. For reasoning, GPT-4o is employed to generate explanations for predicted labels, which are then refined by human annotators to ensure accuracy and coherence.

Our main contribution is a framework for robust DRA extraction from black-box models: we develop a polynomial-time robustness checker for DRAs with a fixed number of registers, and combine it with passive and active automata learning algorithms. This combination yields surrogate DRAs with statistical robustness and equivalence guarantees. As a key application, we use the extracted automata to assess the robustness of neural networks: for a given sequence and distance metric, the DRA either certifies local robustness or produces a concrete counterexample.

The two questions, AI consciousness and existential risk, are sometimes conflated, as if the former entailed the latter. Here, I explain that this view stems from a common confusion between consciousness and intelligence. Yet these two properties are empirically and theoretically distinct. Arguably, while intelligence is a direct predictor of an AI system's existential threat, consciousness is not. There are, however, certain incidental scenarios in which consciousness could influence existential risk, in either direction. Consciousness could be viewed as a means towards AI alignment, thereby lowering existential risk; or, it could be a precondition for reaching certain capabilities or levels of intelligence, and thus positively related to existential risk. Recognizing these distinctions can help AI safety researchers and public policymakers focus on the most pressing issues."}

While they perform well when fine-tuned for a single embodiment or task family, extending them to multi-skill settings remains challenging: directly merging VLA experts trained on different tasks results in near-zero success rates. This raises a fundamental question: what prevents VLAs from mastering multiple skills within one model? With an empirical decomposition of learnable parameters during VLA fine-tuning, we identify two key sources of non-mergeability: (1) Finetuning drives LoRA adapters in the VLM backbone toward divergent, task-specific directions beyond the capacity of existing merging methods to unify. (2) Action experts develop inter-block dependencies through self-attention feedback, causing task information to spread across layers and preventing modular recombination. To address these challenges, we present MergeVLA, a merging-oriented VLA architecture that preserves mergeability by design. MergeVLA introduces sparsely activated LoRA adapters via task masks to retain consistent parameters and reduce irreconcilable conflicts in the VLM. Its action expert replaces self-attention with cross-attention-only blocks to keep specialization localized and composable. When the task is unknown, it uses a test-time task router to adaptively select the appropriate task mask and expert head from the initial observation, enabling unsupervised task inference. Across LIBERO, LIBERO-Plus, RoboTwin, and multi-task experiments on the real SO101 robotic arm, MergeVLA achieves performance comparable to or even exceeding individually finetuned experts, demonstrating robust generalization across tasks, embodiments, and environments."}

However, most traditional machine learning methods rely heavily on prior knowledge and handcrafted features, while existing deep learning models still struggle to jointly capture fine-grained time-frequency patterns and achieve clinical interpretability. Recently, vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in the medical domain, yet their performance remains constrained when applied to physiological waveform data, especially EEG signals, due to their limited visual understanding and insufficient reasoning capability. To address these challenges, we propose EEG-VLM, a hierarchical vision-language framework that integrates multi-level feature alignment with visually enhanced language-guided reasoning for interpretable EEG-based sleep stage classification. Specifically, a specialized visual enhancement module constructs high-level visual tokens from intermediate-layer features to extract rich semantic representations of EEG images. These tokens are further aligned with low-level CLIP features through a multi-level alignment mechanism, enhancing the VLM's image-processing capability. In addition, a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning strategy decomposes complex medical inference into interpretable logical steps, effectively simulating expert-like decision-making. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves both the accuracy and interpretability of VLMs in EEG-based sleep stage classification, showing promising potential for automated and explainable EEG analysis in clinical settings."}

Current approaches face critical limitations: analytical filtering methods suffer from modeling uncertainties and cumulative drift, hybrid learning-filtering approaches remain constrained by their analytical components, while pure learning-based methods struggle with simulation-to-reality transfer and demand extensive real-world data collection. This paper introduces AutoOdom, a novel autoregressive proprioceptive odometry system that overcomes these challenges through an innovative two-stage training paradigm. Stage 1 employs large-scale simulation data to learn complex nonlinear dynamics and rapidly changing contact states inherent in legged locomotion, while Stage 2 introduces an autoregressive enhancement mechanism using limited real-world data to effectively bridge the sim-to-real gap. The key innovation lies in our autoregressive training approach, where the model learns from its own predictions to develop resilience against sensor noise and improve robustness in highly dynamic environments. Comprehensive experimental validation on the Booster T1 humanoid robot demonstrates that AutoOdom significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across all evaluation metrics, achieving 57.2% improvement in absolute trajectory error, 59.2% improvement in Umeyama-aligned error, and 36.2% improvement in relative pose error compared to the Legolas baseline. Extensive ablation studies provide critical insights into sensor modality selection and temporal modeling, revealing counterintuitive findings about IMU acceleration data and validating our systematic design choices for robust proprioceptive odometry in challenging locomotion scenarios."}

However, they often fail to achieve state-of-the-art point estimation performance compared to regression-based methods. This limitation stems from difficulties in providing sufficient contextual bias to track distribution shifts and in balancing output diversity with the stability and precision required for point forecasts. Existing diffusion-based approaches mainly focus on full-distribution modeling under probabilistic frameworks, often with likelihood maximization objectives, while paying little attention to dedicated strategies for high-accuracy point estimation. Moreover, other existing point prediction diffusion methods frequently rely on pre-trained or jointly trained mature models for contextual bias, sacrificing the generative flexibility of diffusion models.\n  To address these challenges, we propose SimDiff, a single-stage, end-to-end framework. SimDiff employs a single unified Transformer network carefully tailored to serve as both denoiser and predictor, eliminating the need for external pre-trained or jointly trained regressors. It achieves state-of-the-art point estimation performance by leveraging intrinsic output diversity and improving mean squared error accuracy through multiple inference ensembling. Key innovations, including normalization independence and the median-of-means estimator, further enhance adaptability and stability.

We integrate error related potentials decoded from offline-trained EEG classifiers into reward shaping and systematically evaluate the impact of human-feedback weighting. Experiments on a 7-DoF manipulator in an obstacle-rich reaching environment show that neural feedback accelerates reinforcement learning and, depending on the human-feedback weighting, can yield task success rates that at times exceed those of sparse-reward baselines. Moreover, when applying the best-performing feedback weighting across all sub jects, we observe consistent acceleration of reinforcement learning relative to the sparse-reward setting. Furthermore, leave-one subject-out evaluations confirm that the proposed framework remains robust despite the intrinsic inter-individual variability in EEG decodability. Our findings demonstrate that EEG-based reinforcement learning can scale beyond locomotion tasks and provide a viable pathway for human-aligned manipulation skill acquisition."}

In contrast, existing agents typically demonstrate improvements via self-evolving within a single domain, implicitly assuming a fixed environment distribution. Cross-environment learning has remained largely unmeasured: there is no standard collection of controllable, heterogeneous environments, nor a unified way to represent how agents learn. We address these gaps in two steps. First, we propose AutoEnv, an automated framework that treats environments as factorizable distributions over transitions, observations, and rewards, enabling low-cost (4.12 USD on average) generation of heterogeneous worlds. Using AutoEnv, we construct AutoEnv-36, a dataset of 36 environments with 358 validated levels, on which seven language models achieve 12-49% normalized reward, demonstrating the challenge of AutoEnv-36. Second, we formalize agent learning as a component-centric process driven by three stages of Selection, Optimization, and Evaluation applied to an improvable agent component. Using this formulation, we design eight learning methods and evaluate them on AutoEnv-36. Empirically, the gain of any single learning method quickly decrease as the number of environments increases, revealing that fixed learning methods do not scale across heterogeneous environments. Environment-adaptive selection of learning methods substantially improves performance but exhibits diminishing returns as the method space expands. These results highlight both the necessity and the current limitations of agent learning for scalable cross-environment generalization, and position AutoEnv and AutoEnv-36 as a testbed for studying cross-environment agent learning.

However, the significant computational overhead of processing redundant visual tokens remains a critical bottleneck for real-time robotic deployment. While standard token pruning techniques can alleviate this, these task-agnostic methods struggle to preserve task-critical visual information. To address this challenge, simultaneously preserving both the holistic context and fine-grained details for precise action, we propose Compressor-VLA, a novel hybrid instruction-conditioned token compression framework designed for efficient, task-oriented compression of visual information in VLA models. The proposed Compressor-VLA framework consists of two token compression modules: a Semantic Task Compressor (STC) that distills holistic, task-relevant context, and a Spatial Refinement Compressor (SRC) that preserves fine-grained spatial details. This compression is dynamically modulated by the natural language instruction, allowing for the adaptive condensation of task-relevant visual information. Experimentally, extensive evaluations demonstrate that Compressor-VLA achieves a competitive success rate on the LIBERO benchmark while reducing FLOPs by 59% and the visual token count by over 3x compared to its baseline. The real-robot deployments on a dual-arm robot platform validate the model's sim-to-real transferability and practical applicability. Moreover, qualitative analyses reveal that our instruction guidance dynamically steers the model's perceptual focus toward task-relevant objects, thereby validating the effectiveness of our approach."}

While process reward models (PRMs) can guide agents by ranking candidate steps at test-time, existing PRMs, designed for short reasoning with binary judgment, cannot capture richer dimensions of information-seeking steps, such as tool interactions and reasoning over tool outputs, nor handle the rapidly growing context in long-horizon tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce PRInTS, a generative PRM trained with dual capabilities: (1) dense scoring based on the PRM's reasoning across multiple step quality dimensions (e.g., interpretation of tool outputs, tool call informativeness) and (2) trajectory summarization that compresses the growing context while preserving essential information for step evaluation. Extensive evaluations across FRAMES, GAIA (levels 1-3), and WebWalkerQA (easy-hard) benchmarks on multiple models, along with ablations, reveal that best-of-n sampling with PRInTS enhances information-seeking abilities of open-source models as well as specialized agents, matching or surpassing the performance of frontier models with a much smaller backbone agent and outperforming other strong reward modeling baselines."}

To address these issues, we propose a vehicle following framework that expands its capability from restricted scenarios to general scenario applications using only a camera.

The method incorporates a semantic mask to address causal confusion in multi-frame data fusion. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic sampling mechanism to precisely track the trajectories of preceding vehicles.

News recommender systems (NRSs) have shown to be useful in this process, minimizing political disengagement and information overload by providing individuals with articles on topics that matter to them. Unfortunately, NRSs often conflate underlying user interest with the partisan bias of the articles in their reading history and with the most popular biases present in the coverage of their favored topics. Over extended interaction, this can result in the formation of filter bubbles and the polarization of user partisanship. In this paper, we propose a novel embedding space called Constructed Political Coordinates (CPC), which models the political partisanship of users over a given topic-space, relative to a larger sample population. We apply a simple collaborative filtering (CF) framework using CPC-based correlation to recommend articles sourced from oppositional users, who have different biases from the user in question. We compare against classical CF methods and find that CPC-based methods promote pointed bias diversity and better match the true political tolerance of users, while classical methods implicitly exploit biases to maximize interaction."}

However, MASt3R-SLAM is limited to single-agent operation. In this paper, we extend MASt3R-SLAM to introduce the first multi-agent monocular dense SLAM system. Each agent performs local SLAM using a 3D reconstruction prior, and their individual maps are fused into a globally consistent map through a loop-closure-based map fusion mechanism.

Traditional solutions, such as regulatory actions, have been implemented to mitigate the spread of misinformation; however, these measures alone are not sufficient. To complement these efforts, educational approaches are becoming essential in empowering users to critically engage with misinformation. Conversation training, through serious games or personalized methods, has emerged as a promising strategy to help users handle science denial and toxic conversation tactics. This paper suggests an interdisciplinary seminar to explore the suitability of Large Language Models (LLMs) acting as a persona of a science denier to support people in identifying misinformation and improving resilience against toxic interactions. In the seminar, groups of four to five students will develop an AI-based chatbot that enables realistic interactions with science-denial argumentation structures. The task involves planning the setting, integrating a Large Language Model to facilitate natural dialogues, implementing the chatbot using the RASA framework, and evaluating the outcomes in a user study. It is crucial that users understand what they need to do during the interaction, how to conclude it, and how the relevant information is conveyed. The seminar does not aim to develop chatbots for practicing debunking but serves to teach AI technologies and test the feasibility of this idea for future applications.

As large language models increasingly enable the creation of sophisticated fake news, understanding human detection capabilities becomes crucial, particularly across different cultural contexts. We conducted a survey where 89 participants (56 South Africans, 33 from other nationalities) evaluated 10 true South African news articles and 10 AI-generated fake versions. Results reveal an asymmetric pattern: South Africans demonstrated superior performance in detecting true news about their country (40% deviation from ideal rating) compared to other participants (52%), but performed worse at identifying fake news (62% vs. 55%). This difference may reflect South Africans' higher overall trust in news sources. Our analysis further shows that South Africans relied more on content knowledge and contextual understanding when judging credibility, while participants from other countries emphasised formal linguistic features such as grammar and structure. Overall, the deviation from ideal rating was similar between groups (51% vs. 53%), suggesting that cultural familiarity appears to aid verification of authentic information but may also introduce bias when evaluating fabricated content. These insights contribute to understanding cross-cultural dimensions of misinformation detection and inform strategies for combating AI-generated fake news in increasingly globalised information ecosystems where content crosses cultural and geographical boundaries."}

However, it is still challenging to exert high actuation forces on the small robots over a large distance. Permanent magnets offer stronger magnetic torques and forces than electromagnetic coils, however, feedback control is more difficult. As proven by Earnshaw's theorem, it is not possible to achieve a stable magnetic trap in 3D by static permanent magnets. Here, we report a stable 2D magnetic force trap by an array of permanent magnets to control a millirobot. The trap is located in an open space with a tunable distance to the magnet array in the range of 20 - 120mm, which is relevant to human anatomical scales. The design is achieved by a novel GPU-accelerated optimization algorithm that uses mean squared error (MSE) and Adam optimizer to efficiently compute the optimal angles for any number of magnets in the array. The algorithm is verified using numerical simulation and physical experiments with an array of two magnets. A millirobot is successfully trapped and controlled to follow a complex trajectory. The algorithm demonstrates high scalability by optimizing the angles for 100 magnets in under three seconds. Moreover, the optimization workflow can be adapted to optimize a permanent magnet array to achieve the desired force vector fields."}

The capabilities enabled by these AI-augmented tools are rapidly leading to the commoditization of computational thinking, such that anyone who can articulate a problem in natural language can potentially harness computing power via AI.\n  This shift is poised to radically influence how we teach computer science and data science in the United States and around the world. Educators and industry leaders are grappling with how to adapt: What should students learn when the hottest new programming language is English? How do we prepare a generation of computational thinkers who need not code every algorithm manually, but must still think critically, design solutions, and verify AI-augmented results?\n  This paper explores these questions, examining the impact of natural language programming on software development, the emerging distinction between programmers and prompt-crafting problem solvers, the reforms needed in computer science and data science curricula, and the importance of maintaining our fundamental computational science principles in an AI-augmented future. Along the way, we compare approaches and share best practices for embracing this new paradigm in computing education."}

The load is modeled using Darcy's law with an added drainage term. A 2D soft arm unit is optimized by formulating it as a compliant mechanism design problem using the robust formulation. The problem is posed as a min-max optimization, where the output deformations of blueprint and eroded designs are considered. A volume constraint is imposed on the blueprint part, while a strain-energy constraint is enforced on the eroded part. The MMA is employed to solve the optimization problem and obtain the optimized soft unit. Finite element analysis with the Ogden material model confirms that the optimized 2D unit outperforms a conventional rectangular design under pneumatic loading. The optimized 2D unit is extruded to obtain a 3D module, and ten such units are assembled to create a soft arm. Deformation profiles of the optimized arm are analysed under different pressure loads. Four arms are 3D-printed and integrated with a supporting structure to realize the proposed SPG. The gripping performance of the SPG is demonstrated on objects with different weights, sizes, stiffness, and shapes."}

Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models leverage massive pretraining data to support diverse manipulation tasks, but they still depend heavily on task-specific fine-tuning, revealing a lack of continual learning capability. Existing continual learning methods are also resource-intensive to scale to VLA models. We propose Stellar VLA, a knowledge-driven continual learning framework with two variants: T-Stellar, modeling task-centric knowledge space, and TS-Stellar, capturing hierarchical task-skill structure. Stellar VLA enables self-supervised knowledge evolution through joint learning of task latent representation and the knowledge space, reducing annotation needs. Knowledge-guided expert routing provide task specialization without extra network parameters, lowering training overhead.Experiments on the LIBERO benchmark and real-world tasks show over 50 percentage average improvement in final success rates relative to baselines. TS-Stellar further excels in complex action inference, and in-depth analyses verify effective knowledge retention and discovery. Our code will be released soon."}

A Case Study on Childhood Lead Testing", "comment": null, "summary": "Public health agencies face critical challenges in identifying high-risk neighborhoods for childhood lead exposure with limited resources for outreach and intervention programs. To address this, we develop a Priority Score integrating untested children proportions, elevated blood lead prevalence, and public health coverage patterns to support optimized resource allocation decisions across 136 neighborhoods in Chicago, New York City, and Washington, D.C. We leverage these allocation tasks, which require integrating multiple vulnerability indicators and interpreting empirical evidence, to evaluate whether large language models (LLMs) with agentic reasoning and deep research capabilities can effectively allocate public health resources when presented with structured allocation scenarios. LLMs were tasked with distributing 1,000 test kits within each city based on neighborhood vulnerability indicators. Results reveal significant limitations: LLMs frequently overlooked neighborhoods with highest lead prevalence and largest proportions of untested children, such as West Englewood in Chicago, while allocating disproportionate resources to lower-priority areas like Hunts Point in New York City. Overall accuracy averaged 0.46, reaching a maximum of 0.66 with ChatGPT 5 Deep Research.

To mitigate the trade-off, we propose a $\\textbf{mixture of horizons (MoH)}$ strategy. MoH rearranges the action chunk into several segments with different horizons, processes them in parallel with a shared action transformer, and fuses outputs with a light linear gate. It has three appealing benefits. 1) MoH exploits long-term foresight and short-term precision jointly within a single model, improving both performance and generalizability to complex tasks. 2) MoH is plug-and-play for full-attention action modules with minimal training or inference overhead. 3) MoH enables dynamic inference with adaptive horizons, which selects stable actions through cross-horizon consensus, achieving 2.5$\\times$ higher throughput than baselines while preserving superior performance. Extensive experiments over flow-based policies $π_0$, $π_{0.5}$, and one-step regression policy $π_{\\text{reg}}$ demonstrate that MoH yields consistent and significant gains on both simulations and real-world tasks.

In a field experiment on a large online labor market, I hired 450 U.S.-based remote workers to complete an image-categorization job assisted by AI recommendations. Workers were incentivized by the prospect of a contract extension based on an HR evaluator's feedback. I find that workers adopt AI recommendations at lower rates when their reliance on AI is visible to the evaluator, resulting in a measurable decline in task performance. The effects are present despite a conservative design in which workers know that the evaluator is explicitly instructed to assess expected accuracy on the same AI-assisted task. This reduction in AI reliance persists even when the evaluator is reassured about workers' strong performance history on the platform, underscoring how difficult these concerns are to alleviate. Leveraging the platform's public feedback feature, I introduce a novel incentive-compatible elicitation method showing that workers fear heavy reliance on AI signals a lack of confidence in their own judgment, a trait they view as essential when collaborating with AI."}

Our key insight is to treat language as a probabilistic observation over the user's latent preferences, clarifying which reward features matter and how physical corrections should be interpreted. QuickLAP uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract reward feature attention masks and preference shifts from free-form utterances, which it integrates with physical feedback in a closed-form update rule. This enables fast, real-time, and robust reward learning that handles ambiguous feedback. In a semi-autonomous driving simulator, QuickLAP reduces reward learning error by over 70% compared to physical-only and heuristic multimodal baselines. A 15-participant user study further validates our approach: participants found QuickLAP significantly more understandable and collaborative, and preferred its learned behavior over baselines.

Achieving non-uniform coverage, where spatial priorities vary across the domain, requires coordinating agents while respecting dynamic and communication constraints. Density-driven approaches can distribute agents according to a prescribed reference density, but existing methods do not ensure connectivity. This limitation often leads to communication loss, reduced coordination, and degraded coverage performance.\n  This letter introduces a connectivity-preserving extension of the Density-Driven Optimal Control (D2OC) framework. The coverage objective, defined using the Wasserstein distance between the agent distribution and the reference density, admits a convex quadratic program formulation. Communication constraints are incorporated through a smooth connectivity penalty, which maintains strict convexity, supports distributed implementation, and preserves inter-agent communication without imposing rigid formations.\n  Simulation studies show that the proposed method consistently maintains connectivity, improves convergence speed, and enhances non-uniform coverage quality compared with density-driven schemes that do not incorporate explicit connectivity considerations."}

However, HD map-dependent models suffer from costly data acquisition, delayed updates, and vulnerability to corrupted inputs, causing prediction failures. Map-free approaches lack global context, with pairwise attention over-amplifying straight patterns while suppressing transitional patterns, resulting in motion-intention misalignment. This paper proposes GContextFormer, a plug-and-play encoder-decoder architecture with global context-aware hybrid attention and scaled additive aggregation achieving intention-aligned multimodal prediction without map reliance. The Motion-Aware Encoder builds scene-level intention prior via bounded scaled additive aggregation over mode-embedded trajectory tokens and refines per-mode representations under shared global context, mitigating inter-mode suppression and promoting intention alignment. The Hierarchical Interaction Decoder decomposes social reasoning into dual-pathway cross-attention: a standard pathway ensures uniform geometric coverage over agent-mode pairs while a neighbor-context-enhanced pathway emphasizes salient interactions, with gating module mediating their contributions to maintain coverage-focus balance. Experiments on eight highway-ramp scenarios from TOD-VT dataset show GContextFormer outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Compared to existing transformer models, GContextFormer achieves greater robustness and concentrated improvements in high-curvature and transition zones via spatial distributions. Interpretability is achieved through motion mode distinctions and neighbor context modulation exposing reasoning attribution.

We integrate error related potentials decoded from offline-trained EEG classifiers into reward shaping and systematically evaluate the impact of human-feedback weighting. Experiments on a 7-DoF manipulator in an obstacle-rich reaching environment show that neural feedback accelerates reinforcement learning and, depending on the human-feedback weighting, can yield task success rates that at times exceed those of sparse-reward baselines. Moreover, when applying the best-performing feedback weighting across all sub jects, we observe consistent acceleration of reinforcement learning relative to the sparse-reward setting. Furthermore, leave-one subject-out evaluations confirm that the proposed framework remains robust despite the intrinsic inter-individual variability in EEG decodability.

Our empirical study reveals an inherent trade-off: longer horizons provide stronger global foresight but degrade fine-grained accuracy, while shorter ones sharpen local control yet struggle on long-term tasks, implying fixed choice of single horizons being suboptimal. To mitigate the trade-off, we propose a $\\textbf{mixture of horizons (MoH)}$ strategy. MoH rearranges the action chunk into several segments with different horizons, processes them in parallel with a shared action transformer, and fuses outputs with a light linear gate. It has three appealing benefits. 1) MoH exploits long-term foresight and short-term precision jointly within a single model, improving both performance and generalizability to complex tasks. 2) MoH is plug-and-play for full-attention action modules with minimal training or inference overhead. 3) MoH enables dynamic inference with adaptive horizons, which selects stable actions through cross-horizon consensus, achieving 2.5$\\times$ higher throughput than baselines while preserving superior performance. Extensive experiments over flow-based policies $π_0$, $π_{0.5}$, and one-step regression policy $π_{\\text{reg}}$ demonstrate that MoH yields consistent and significant gains on both simulations and real-world tasks. Notably, under mixed-task setting, $π_{0.5}$ with MoH reaches a new state-of-the-art with 99$\\%$ average success rate on LIBERO after only $30k$ training iterations.
