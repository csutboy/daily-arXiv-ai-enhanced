To provide a reliable solution, this\npaper examines three bias-reduction methods: the Cox-Snell bias correction,\nFirth-score modification, and a maximum penalized likelihood estimator (MPLE)\nusing Jeffreys prior. Through comprehensive simulation studies, we evaluate the\nperformance of these methods in reducing bias and controlling variance,\nespecially when model assumptions are violated.

A key factor affecting circuit\nperformance is the mapping of the abstract quantum circuit to the physical\nlayout of the quantum hardware. This mapping can significantly influence output\nquality, especially since hardware noise profiles are non-uniform and dynamic.\nExisting solutions such as Mapomatic and Just-In-Time (JIT) Transpilation\nattempt to address this issue but are limited either by relying on stale\ncalibration data or high hardware usage, respectively. In this article, we\npropose Quality Indicator Circuits (QICs) as a lightweight, real-time method\nfor assessing layout quality. A QIC is a small probe circuit that is designed\nto retain the basic structure of the user's circuit and whose ideal noiseless\noutcome is known. It is used to evaluate which region of the quantum hardware\nis best suited for executing the circuit of interest. We first propose a basic\nmethod where a QIC is executed for each isomorphic layout to detect the best\namong them. Although this requires several targeted circuit executions, we show\nthat it still, in most cases, reduces the execution overheads as compared with\nJIT. To reduce the overheads further, we propose the union of multiple layouts\nwith a Union QIC approach that has no overlaps, and a Distortion Threshold\nbased approach allowing some overlap. Our results show that these outperform\nMapomatic in the quality of layout selection while reducing the hardware\noverhead of JIT by 79 percent on average.

The STVM uses an open-source voting\nsystem that has a universally designed interface, making the system accessible\nfor all voters independent of their ability or disability.

Existing models\nfor predicting ridesourcing mode choices often suffer from limited predictive\naccuracy due to their inability to capture key psychological factors, and are\nfurther challenged by severe class imbalance, as ridesourcing trips comprise\nonly a small fraction of individuals' daily travel. To address these\nlimitations, this paper introduces the Synthesizing Attitudes, Predicting\nActions (SAPA) framework, a hierarchical approach that uses Large Language\nModels (LLMs) to synthesize theory-grounded latent attitudes to predict\nridesourcing choices. SAPA first uses an LLM to generate qualitative traveler\npersonas from raw travel survey data and then trains a propensity-score model\non demographic and behavioral features, enriched by those personas, to produce\nan individual-level score. Next, the LLM assigns quantitative scores to\ntheory-driven latent variables (e.g., time and cost sensitivity), and a final\nclassifier integrates the propensity score, latent-variable scores (with their\ninteraction terms), and observable trip attributes to predict ridesourcing mode\nchoice. Experiments on a large-scale, multi-year travel survey show that SAPA\nsignificantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, improving ridesourcing\nchoice predictions by up to 75.9% in terms of PR-AUC on a held-out test set.\nThis study provides a powerful tool for accurately predicting ridesourcing mode\nchoices, and provides a methodology that is readily transferable to various\napplications."}

Much of the\nexisting work in nonprehensile manipulation relies on parallel-jaw grippers or\ntools such as rods and spatulas. In contrast, multi-fingered dexterous hands\noffer richer contact modes and versatility for handling diverse objects to\nprovide stable support over the objects, which compensates for the difficulty\nof modeling the dynamics of nonprehensile manipulation. Therefore, we propose\nGeometry-aware Dexterous Pushing and Pulling (GD2P) for nonprehensile\nmanipulation with dexterous robotic hands. We study pushing and pulling by\nframing the problem as synthesizing and learning pre-contact dexterous hand\nposes that lead to effective manipulation. We generate diverse hand poses via\ncontact-guided sampling, filter them using physics simulation, and train a\ndiffusion model conditioned on object geometry to predict viable poses. At test\ntime, we sample hand poses and use standard motion planners to select and\nexecute pushing and pulling actions. We perform 840 real-world experiments with\nan Allegro Hand, comparing our method to baselines. The results indicate that\nGD2P offers a scalable route for training dexterous nonprehensile manipulation\npolicies. We further demonstrate GD2P on a LEAP Hand, highlighting its\napplicability to different hand morphologies. Our pre-trained models and\ndataset, including 1.3 million hand poses across 2.3k objects, will be\nopen-source to facilitate further research.

Hence,\naccurate detection and isolation of faults in perception systems is important.\nFaults in perception systems pose particular challenges: faults are often tied\nto the perceptual context of the environment, and errors in their multi-stage\npipelines can propagate across modules. To address this, we adopt a\ncounterfactual reasoning approach to propose a framework for fault detection\nand isolation (FDI) in perception systems. As opposed to relying on physical\nredundancy (i.e., having extra sensors), our approach utilizes analytical\nredundancy with counterfactual reasoning to construct perception reliability\ntests as causal outcomes influenced by system states and fault scenarios.\nCounterfactual reasoning generates reliability test results under hypothesized\nfaults to update the belief over fault hypotheses. We derive both passive and\nactive FDI methods. While the passive FDI can be achieved by belief updates,\nthe active FDI approach is defined as a causal bandit problem, where we utilize\nMonte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with upper confidence bound (UCB) to find\ncontrol inputs that maximize a detection and isolation metric, designated as\nEffective Information (EI). The mentioned metric quantifies the informativeness\nof control inputs for FDI. We demonstrate the approach in a robot exploration\nscenario, where a space robot performing vision-based navigation actively\nadjusts its attitude to increase EI and correctly isolate faults caused by\nsensor damage, dynamic scenes, and perceptual degradation."}

The Supreme People's\nCourt (SPC) deploys a judicial linkage discourse that aligns adjudication with\nstate policy and administrative governance. Their interaction forms a\nbidirectional conceptual coupling (BCC): an inside-out projection of local\nreasoning and an outside-in translation of policy into doctrine. The coupling\nboth legitimizes and constrains courts and policymakers, balancing pressure for\nunified market standards with safeguards against platform monopolization.\nThrough cases such as HCZJ's Taobao v.

Moreover, the training process\ntends to exhibit strong randomness and slow convergence. It often requires\nconsiderable time or high computational resources. Another class of\nlearning-based method incorporates Lyapunov stability theory to obtain a\ncontrol policy with stability guarantees. However, these methods generally\nrequire an initially stable neural network control policy at the beginning of\ntraining. Evidently, a stable neural network controller can not only serve as\nan initial policy for reinforcement learning, allowing the training to focus on\nimproving controller performance, but also act as an initial state for\nlearning-based Lyapunov control methods. Although stable controllers can be\ndesigned using traditional control theory, designers still need to have a great\ndeal of control design knowledge to address increasingly complicated control\nproblems. The proposed neural network rapid initialization method in this paper\nachieves the initial training of the neural network control policy by\nconstructing datasets that conform to the stability conditions based on the\nsystem model. Furthermore, using the image-based visual servoing control for\nmulticopter interception as a case study, simulations and experiments were\nconducted to validate the effectiveness and practical performance of the\nproposed method. In the experiment, the trained control policy attains a final\ninterception velocity of 15 m/s."}

Hence,\naccurate detection and isolation of faults in perception systems is important.\nFaults in perception systems pose particular challenges: faults are often tied\nto the perceptual context of the environment, and errors in their multi-stage\npipelines can propagate across modules. To address this, we adopt a\ncounterfactual reasoning approach to propose a framework for fault detection\nand isolation (FDI) in perception systems. As opposed to relying on physical\nredundancy (i.e., having extra sensors), our approach utilizes analytical\nredundancy with counterfactual reasoning to construct perception reliability\ntests as causal outcomes influenced by system states and fault scenarios.\nCounterfactual reasoning generates reliability test results under hypothesized\nfaults to update the belief over fault hypotheses. We derive both passive and\nactive FDI methods. While the passive FDI can be achieved by belief updates,\nthe active FDI approach is defined as a causal bandit problem, where we utilize\nMonte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with upper confidence bound (UCB) to find\ncontrol inputs that maximize a detection and isolation metric, designated as\nEffective Information (EI).

Hence,\naccurate detection and isolation of faults in perception systems is important.\nFaults in perception systems pose particular challenges: faults are often tied\nto the perceptual context of the environment, and errors in their multi-stage\npipelines can propagate across modules. To address this, we adopt a\ncounterfactual reasoning approach to propose a framework for fault detection\nand isolation (FDI) in perception systems. As opposed to relying on physical\nredundancy (i.e., having extra sensors), our approach utilizes analytical\nredundancy with counterfactual reasoning to construct perception reliability\ntests as causal outcomes influenced by system states and fault scenarios.\nCounterfactual reasoning generates reliability test results under hypothesized\nfaults to update the belief over fault hypotheses. We derive both passive and\nactive FDI methods. While the passive FDI can be achieved by belief updates,\nthe active FDI approach is defined as a causal bandit problem, where we utilize\nMonte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with upper confidence bound (UCB) to find\ncontrol inputs that maximize a detection and isolation metric, designated as\nEffective Information (EI).

N2M features five key advantages: (1) reliance solely on\nego-centric observation without requiring global or historical information; (2)\nreal-time adaptation to environmental changes; (3) reliable prediction with\nhigh viewpoint robustness; (4) broad applicability across diverse tasks,\nmanipulation policies, and robot hardware; and (5) remarkable data efficiency\nand generalizability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of N2M through extensive\nsimulation and real-world experiments. In the PnPCounterToCab task, N2M\nimproves the averaged success rate from 3% with the reachability-based baseline\nto 54%. Furthermore, in the Toybox Handover task, N2M provides reliable\npredictions even in unseen environments with only 15 data samples, showing\nremarkable data efficiency and generalizability."}

These policies provide\na strong prior over how robots should behave -- e.g., how a robot arm should\nmanipulate food items. But in order for robots to match an individual person's\nneeds, users typically fine-tune these generalized policies -- e.g., showing\nthe robot arm how to make their own preferred dinners. Importantly, during the\nprocess of personalizing robots, end-users leak data about their preferences,\nhabits, and styles (e.g., the foods they prefer to eat). Other agents can\nsimply roll-out the fine-tuned policy and see these personally-trained\nbehaviors. This leads to a fundamental challenge: how can we develop robots\nthat personalize actions while keeping learning private from external agents?\nWe here explore this emerging topic in human-robot interaction and develop\nPRoP, a model-agnostic framework for personalized and private robot policies.\nOur core idea is to equip each user with a unique key; this key is then used to\nmathematically transform the weights of the robot's network. With the correct\nkey, the robot's policy switches to match that user's preferences -- but with\nincorrect keys, the robot reverts to its baseline behaviors. We show the\ngeneral applicability of our method across multiple model types in imitation\nlearning, reinforcement learning, and classification tasks. PRoP is practically\nadvantageous because it retains the architecture and behaviors of the original\npolicy, and experimentally outperforms existing encoder-based approaches.

With\nthe emergence of new AI regulations, the state of the art of artificial\nintelligence risk management seems to be highly immature due to upcoming AI\nregulations. Despite the appearance of several methodologies and generic\ncriteria, it is rare to find guidelines with real implementation value,\nconsidering that the most important issue is customizing artificial\nintelligence risk metrics and risk models for specific AI risk scenarios.\nFurthermore, the financial departments, legal departments and Government Risk\nCompliance teams seem to remain unaware of many technical aspects of AI\nsystems, in which data scientists and AI engineers emerge as the most\nappropriate implementers. It is crucial to decompose the problem of artificial\nintelligence risk in several dimensions: data protection, fairness, accuracy,\nrobustness, and information security.

Reinforcement learning can refine polices to alleviate this\nlimitation, yet real-robot training is costly and unsafe, while training in\nsimulators suffers from the sim-to-real gap. Recent advances in generative\nmodels have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in real-world simulation, with\ndiffusion models in particular excelling at generation. This raises the\nquestion of how diffusion model-based world models can be combined to enhance\npre-trained policies in robotic manipulation. In this work, we propose\nWorld4RL, a framework that employs diffusion-based world models as\nhigh-fidelity simulators to refine pre-trained policies entirely in imagined\nenvironments for robotic manipulation. Unlike prior works that primarily employ\nworld models for planning, our framework enables direct end-to-end policy\noptimization. World4RL is designed around two principles: pre-training a\ndiffusion world model that captures diverse dynamics on multi-task datasets and\nrefining policies entirely within a frozen world model to avoid online\nreal-world interactions. We further design a two-hot action encoding scheme\ntailored for robotic manipulation and adopt diffusion backbones to improve\nmodeling fidelity. Extensive simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate\nthat World4RL provides high-fidelity environment modeling and enables\nconsistent policy refinement, yielding significantly higher success rates\ncompared to imitation learning and other baselines.

However, this refinement is typically guided by short-term environmental\nfeedback, limiting LLMs from developing plans aligned with long-term rewards.\nWe propose Code Driven Planning with Domain-Adaptive Critic (CoPiC).

Although intermittent faults pose substantial challenges to\nreliability and coordination, existing studies of fault tolerance in robot\nswarms focus instead on permanent faults. One reason for this is that\nintermittent faults are prohibitively difficult to detect in the fully\nself-organized ad-hoc networks typical of robot swarms, as their network\ntopologies are transient and often unpredictable. However, in the recently\nintroduced self-organizing nervous systems (SoNS) approach, robot swarms are\nable to self-organize persistent network structures for the first time, easing\nthe problem of detecting intermittent faults. To address intermittent faults in\nrobot swarms that have persistent networks, we propose a novel\nproactive-reactive strategy to detection and mitigation, based on\nself-organized backup layers and distributed consensus in a multiplex network.\nProactively, the robots self-organize dynamic backup paths before faults occur,\nadapting to changes in the primary network topology and the robots' relative\npositions. Reactively, robots use one-shot likelihood ratio tests to compare\ninformation received along different paths in the multiplex network, enabling\nearly fault detection. Upon detection, communication is temporarily rerouted in\na self-organized way, until the detected fault resolves. We validate the\napproach in representative scenarios of faulty positional data occurring during\nformation control, demonstrating that intermittent faults are prevented from\ndisrupting convergence to desired formations, with high fault detection\naccuracy and low rates of false positives."}

In contrast, multi-fingered dexterous hands\noffer richer contact modes and versatility for handling diverse objects to\nprovide stable support over the objects, which compensates for the difficulty\nof modeling the dynamics of nonprehensile manipulation. Therefore, we propose\nGeometry-aware Dexterous Pushing and Pulling (GD2P) for nonprehensile\nmanipulation with dexterous robotic hands.

Hence,\naccurate detection and isolation of faults in perception systems is important.\nFaults in perception systems pose particular challenges: faults are often tied\nto the perceptual context of the environment, and errors in their multi-stage\npipelines can propagate across modules. To address this, we adopt a\ncounterfactual reasoning approach to propose a framework for fault detection\nand isolation (FDI) in perception systems. As opposed to relying on physical\nredundancy (i.e., having extra sensors), our approach utilizes analytical\nredundancy with counterfactual reasoning to construct perception reliability\ntests as causal outcomes influenced by system states and fault scenarios.\nCounterfactual reasoning generates reliability test results under hypothesized\nfaults to update the belief over fault hypotheses. We derive both passive and\nactive FDI methods. While the passive FDI can be achieved by belief updates,\nthe active FDI approach is defined as a causal bandit problem, where we utilize\nMonte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with upper confidence bound (UCB) to find\ncontrol inputs that maximize a detection and isolation metric, designated as\nEffective Information (EI).

We propose Self-Improvement via On-Manifold Exploration (SOE), a\nframework that enhances policy exploration and improvement in robotic\nmanipulation. SOE learns a compact latent representation of task-relevant\nfactors and constrains exploration to the manifold of valid actions, ensuring\nsafety, diversity, and effectiveness. It can be seamlessly integrated with\narbitrary policy models as a plug-in module, augmenting exploration without\ndegrading the base policy performance. Moreover, the structured latent space\nenables human-guided exploration, further improving efficiency and\ncontrollability. Extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world tasks\ndemonstrate that SOE consistently outperforms prior methods, achieving higher\ntask success rates, smoother and safer exploration, and superior sample\nefficiency. These results establish on-manifold exploration as a principled\napproach to sample-efficient policy self-improvement. Project website:\nhttps://ericjin2002.github.io/SOE"}

A key factor affecting circuit\nperformance is the mapping of the abstract quantum circuit to the physical\nlayout of the quantum hardware. This mapping can significantly influence output\nquality, especially since hardware noise profiles are non-uniform and dynamic.\nExisting solutions such as Mapomatic and Just-In-Time (JIT) Transpilation\nattempt to address this issue but are limited either by relying on stale\ncalibration data or high hardware usage, respectively. In this article, we\npropose Quality Indicator Circuits (QICs) as a lightweight, real-time method\nfor assessing layout quality. A QIC is a small probe circuit that is designed\nto retain the basic structure of the user's circuit and whose ideal noiseless\noutcome is known.

In\nthe UK, the National Energy System Operator (NESO) has introduced a suite of\nthree new dynamic services, where aggregation of assets is expected to play a\nkey role. For an Aggregated Response Unit (ARU), the required level of\nfrequency response varies with grid frequency, resulting in a frequency-varying\nequality constraint that assets should meet collectively.

Although intermittent faults pose substantial challenges to\nreliability and coordination, existing studies of fault tolerance in robot\nswarms focus instead on permanent faults. One reason for this is that\nintermittent faults are prohibitively difficult to detect in the fully\nself-organized ad-hoc networks typical of robot swarms, as their network\ntopologies are transient and often unpredictable. However, in the recently\nintroduced self-organizing nervous systems (SoNS) approach, robot swarms are\nable to self-organize persistent network structures for the first time, easing\nthe problem of detecting intermittent faults. To address intermittent faults in\nrobot swarms that have persistent networks, we propose a novel\nproactive-reactive strategy to detection and mitigation, based on\nself-organized backup layers and distributed consensus in a multiplex network.\nProactively, the robots self-organize dynamic backup paths before faults occur,\nadapting to changes in the primary network topology and the robots' relative\npositions. Reactively, robots use one-shot likelihood ratio tests to compare\ninformation received along different paths in the multiplex network, enabling\nearly fault detection. Upon detection, communication is temporarily rerouted in\na self-organized way, until the detected fault resolves.

Additionally, a Hierarchical\nDual-Stage Motion Architecture combines an Imitation Learning-based Global Path\nGenerator with a Quadratic Programming-driven Local Planner to ensure real-time\nmotion feasibility, obstacle avoidance, and superior manipulability. The\nproposed method is evaluated through a series of force-intensive tasks,\ndemonstrating significant improvements in grasp transition efficiency and\nmotion performance.

Although some work has\nexplored cultural alignment, the potential for cross-cultural transfer, using\nalignment in one culture to improve performance in others, remains\nunderexplored. This paper investigates cross-cultural transfer of commonsense\nreasoning in the Arab world, where linguistic and historical similarities\ncoexist with local cultural differences. Using a culturally grounded\ncommonsense reasoning dataset covering 13 Arab countries, we evaluate\nlightweight alignment methods such as in-context learning and\ndemonstration-based reinforcement (DITTO), alongside baselines like supervised\nfine-tuning and direct preference optimization. Our results show that merely 12\nculture-specific examples from one country can improve performance in others by\n10\\% on average, within multilingual models. In addition, we demonstrate that\nout-of-culture demonstrations from Indonesia and US contexts can match or\nsurpass in-culture alignment for MCQ reasoning, highlighting cultural\ncommonsense transferability beyond the Arab world. These findings demonstrate\nthat efficient cross-cultural alignment is possible and offer a promising\napproach to adapt LLMs to low-resource cultural settings."}

The\nmain goal of multitask LQR is to find a controller with satisfactory\nperformance on every task. Prior analyses on relevant contexts fail to capture\nclosed-loop task similarities, resulting in conservative performance\nguarantees. To account for such similarities, we propose bisimulation-based\nmeasures of task heterogeneity. Our measures employ new bisimulation functions\nto bound the cost gradient distance between a pair of tasks in closed loop with\na common stabilizing controller. Employing these measures, we derive\nsuboptimality bounds for both the multitask optimal controller and the\nasymptotic policy gradient controller with respect to each of the tasks. We\nfurther provide conditions under which the policy gradient iterates remain\nstabilizing for every system. For multiple random sets of certain tasks, we\nobserve that our bisimulation-based measures improve upon baseline measures of\ntask heterogeneity dramatically."}

Yet robot policies often lack\nsufficient exploration capability due to action mode collapse. Existing methods\nthat encourage exploration typically rely on random perturbations, which are\nunsafe and induce unstable, erratic behaviors, thereby limiting their\neffectiveness. We propose Self-Improvement via On-Manifold Exploration (SOE), a\nframework that enhances policy exploration and improvement in robotic\nmanipulation. SOE learns a compact latent representation of task-relevant\nfactors and constrains exploration to the manifold of valid actions, ensuring\nsafety, diversity, and effectiveness. It can be seamlessly integrated with\narbitrary policy models as a plug-in module, augmenting exploration without\ndegrading the base policy performance. Moreover, the structured latent space\nenables human-guided exploration, further improving efficiency and\ncontrollability. Extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world tasks\ndemonstrate that SOE consistently outperforms prior methods, achieving higher\ntask success rates, smoother and safer exploration, and superior sample\nefficiency. These results establish on-manifold exploration as a principled\napproach to sample-efficient policy self-improvement. Project website:\nhttps://ericjin2002.github.io/SOE"}

However, these approaches are limited by the quality of human\ndemonstrations, the manual effort required for data collection, and the\ndiminishing returns from increasing offline data. In comparison, reinforcement\nlearning (RL) trains an agent through autonomous interaction with the\nenvironment and has shown remarkable success in various domains. Still,\ntraining RL policies directly on real-world robots remains challenging due to\nsample inefficiency, safety concerns, and the difficulty of learning from\nsparse rewards for long-horizon tasks, especially for high-degree-of-freedom\n(DoF) systems. We present a recipe that combines the benefits of BC and RL\nthrough a residual learning framework. Our approach leverages BC policies as\nblack-box bases and learns lightweight per-step residual corrections via\nsample-efficient off-policy RL. We demonstrate that our method requires only\nsparse binary reward signals and can effectively improve manipulation policies\non high-degree-of-freedom (DoF) systems in both simulation and the real world.\nIn particular, we demonstrate, to the best of our knowledge, the first\nsuccessful real-world RL training on a humanoid robot with dexterous hands. Our\nresults demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in various vision-based tasks,\npointing towards a practical pathway for deploying RL in the real world.\nProject website: https://residual-offpolicy-rl.github.io"}
