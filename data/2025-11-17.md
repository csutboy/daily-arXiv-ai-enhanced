### [1] [Multi-team Formation System for Collaborative Crowdsourcing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10926)
*Ryota Yamamoto,Kazushi Okamoto*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用社交网络信息进行多任务团队组建的启发式优化算法，该算法同时考虑工人兼容性和专业知识，在模拟实验中优于爬山法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决复杂众包任务中需要多人协作的问题，考虑工人兼容性、专业知识和预算限制，避免团队规模过大影响协作效果。

Method: 使用社交网络表示历史协作关系，边权重对应工人兼容性评分；采用启发式优化算法组建团队；通过高斯过程回归分析实验参数与评估值的关系；使用贝叶斯优化估计实验参数。

Result: 当团队规模限制、社交网络平均度和任务预算设置较低时，评估值极低；提出的算法在几乎所有实验条件下都优于爬山法；模拟退火温度下降率约为0.9时获得最高评估值；平滑目标函数无效。

Conclusion: 提出的基于社交网络的团队组建算法能有效优化工人兼容性，在多种实验条件下表现优于传统方法，为复杂众包任务的团队组建提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: For complex crowdsourcing tasks that require collaboration between multiple individuals, teams should be formed by considering both worker compatibility and expertise. Furthermore, the nature of crowdsourcing dictates the budget for tasks and workers' remuneration, and excessively large team sizes may reduce collaborative performance. To address these challenges, we propose a heuristic optimization algorithm that leverages social network information to simultaneously form teams with optimized worker compatibility for multiple tasks. In our approach, historical collaboration is represented as a social network, where the edge weights correspond to explicit ratings of worker compatibility. In a simulation experiment using synthetic data, we applied Gaussian process regression to examine the relationship between eight experimental parameters and evaluation values, thereby analyzing the output of the proposed algorithm. To generate the necessary data for regression, we ran the proposed algorithm with experimental parameters that were sequentially estimated using Bayesian optimization. Our experiments revealed that the evaluation values were extremely low when the team size limit, the degree mean of the social network, and the task budget were set to low values. The results also indicate that the proposed algorithm outperformed the hill-climbing method under almost all experimental conditions. In addition, the highest evaluation values were achieved when the simulated annealing temperature decrease rate was approximately 0.9, while smoothing the objective function proved ineffective.

### [2] [Structural asymmetry as a fraud signature: detecting collusion with Heron's Information Coefficient](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10957)
*Allana Tavares Bastos,Tiago Alves Schieber,Renato Hadad,Laura Carpi,Martín Gómez Ravetti*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: 提出了Heron信息系数(HIC)这一几何度量方法，用于检测巴西医疗采购系统中的欺诈行为，相比传统指标能更好地发现串通模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在巴西统一卫生系统等大型分散化采购系统中，欺诈问题持续存在，需要更有效的检测方法来发现标准指标可能忽略的串通行为。

Method: 引入Heron信息系数(HIC)作为几何度量，量化子图与网络全局结构的偏离程度，应用于巴西8年医疗用品招标数据，并通过合成实验验证效果。

Result: HIC能够揭示传统稳健性指标无法发现的串通模式，在不同腐败强度和网络规模下都表现出强大的检测性能。

Conclusion: HIC为审计人员和政策制定者提供了有效的补充工具，简单的几何洞察力比信息论指标更能揭示现实世界网络中的隐藏动态。

Abstract: Fraud in public procurement remains a persistent challenge, especially in large, decentralized systems like Brazil's Unified Health System. We introduce Heron's Information Coefficient (HIC), a geometric measure that quantifies how subgraphs deviate from the global structure of a network. Applied to over eight years of Brazilian bidding data for medical supplies, this measure highlights collusive patterns that standard indicators may overlook. Unlike conventional robustness metrics, the Heron coefficient focuses on the interaction between active and inactive subgraphs, revealing structural shifts that may signal coordinated behavior, such as cartel formation. Synthetic experiments support these findings, demonstrating strong detection performance across varying corruption intensities and network sizes. While our results do not replace legal or economic analyses, they offer an effective complementary tool for auditors and policymakers to monitor procurement integrity more effectively. This study demonstrates that simple geometric insight can reveal hidden dynamics in real-world networks better than other Information Theoretic metrics.

### [3] [Modeling and Control of Sustainable Transitions through Opinion-Behavior Coupling in Heterogeneous Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11053)
*Martina Alutto,Sofia Bellotti,Fabrizio Dabbene,Chiara Ravazzi*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: 提出了一个数据驱动的计算框架，用于模拟社会系统中耦合的意见-采纳动态，重点关注电动汽车在北欧的采用情况。模型结合了行为传染、放弃行为和意见反馈机制，通过分析均衡点来推导大规模采用的条件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解可持续行为在异质社会中的传播需要整合行为数据、社会影响机制和结构化控制方法，以促进可持续转型。

Method: 使用多层网络模型，每个节点代表具有特定年龄组和流动性水平的社区。模型包含三个机制：通过社会和信息化传播的行为传染、不满驱动的放弃行为、以及通过社会影响的意见与采用水平之间的反馈。

Result: 模拟结果显示，旨在改善体验和减少不满的政策比基于意见的政策更能确保稳定和长期的采用。

Conclusion: 改善体验和减少不满的控制策略比单纯基于社会网络的意见政策更有效，为设计促进可持续转型的有效干预措施提供了具体见解。

Abstract: Understanding how sustainable behaviors spread within heterogeneous societies requires the integration of behavioral data, social influence mechanisms, and structured approaches to control. In this paper, we propose a data-driven computational framework for coupled opinion-adoption dynamics in social systems. Each node in the multilayer network represents a community characterized by a specific age group and mobility level, derived from large-scale survey data on the predisposition to adopt electric vehicles in Northern Europe. The proposed model captures three mechanisms: behavioral contagion through social and informational diffusion, abandonment driven by dissatisfaction, and feedback between opinions and adoption levels through social influence. Analyzing the equilibrium points of the coupled system allows us to derive the conditions that enable large-scale adoption. We empirically calibrate the model using data to construct synthetic populations and social similarity networks, which we use to explore targeted interventions that promote sustainable transitions. Specifically, the analysis focuses on two types of control strategies: opinion-based policies, which act on the social network layer, and policies that aim to improve experience and reduce dissatisfaction. Simulation results show that the latter ensure more stable and long-term adoption, offering concrete insights for designing effective interventions in sociotechnical transitions toward sustainability.

### [4] [Latent space models for grouped multiplex networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11086)
*Alexander Kagan,Peter W. MacDonald,Elizaveta Levina,Ji Zhu*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: 提出了GroupMultiNeSS模型，用于从多层网络中同时提取共享、组特定和个体潜在结构，解决了现有方法无法识别组级结构的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界多层网络通常包含仅在特定层子集中共享的组级结构模式，这些模式能揭示网络组间的系统性差异，但现有方法主要关注所有网络共享的结构或个体变异。

Method: 使用凸优化结合核范数惩罚的拟合程序，确保在共享、组特定和个体潜在子空间有足够分离时能恢复潜在位置。

Result: 在合成场景中相比MultiNeSS和其他多路网络模型，建模精度明显提升；在帕金森病脑连接数据集上能更好地突出治疗组和对照组间的生物学差异。

Conclusion: GroupMultiNeSS模型能有效识别多层网络中的组级结构，为下游测试和低维可视化等任务提供更好的基础。

Abstract: Complex multilayer network datasets have become ubiquitous in various applications, including neuroscience, social sciences, economics, and genetics. Notable examples include brain connectivity networks collected across multiple patients or trade networks between countries collected across multiple goods. Existing statistical approaches to such data typically focus on modeling the structure shared by all networks; some go further by accounting for individual, layer-specific variation. However, real-world multilayer networks often exhibit additional patterns shared only within certain subsets of layers, which can represent treatment and control groups, or patients grouped by a specific trait. Identifying these group-level structures can uncover systematic differences between groups of networks and influence many downstream tasks, such as testing and low-dimensional visualization. To address this gap, we introduce the GroupMultiNeSS model, which enables the simultaneous extraction of shared, group-specific, and individual latent structures from a sample of networks on a shared node set. For this model, we establish identifiability, develop a fitting procedure using convex optimization in combination with a nuclear norm penalty, and prove a guarantee of recovery for the latent positions as long as there is sufficient separation between the shared, group-specific, and individual latent subspaces. We compare the model with MultiNeSS and other models for multiplex networks in various synthetic scenarios and observe an apparent improvement in the modeling accuracy when the group component is accounted for. Experiment with the Parkinson's disease brain connectivity dataset demonstrates the superiority of GroupMultiNeSS in highlighting node-level insights on biological differences between the treatment and control patient groups.

### [5] [StochEP: Stochastic Equilibrium Propagation for Spiking Convergent Recurrent Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11320)
*Jiaqi Lin,Yi Jiang,Abhronil Sengupta*

Main category: cs.ET

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于随机脉冲神经元的平衡传播框架，通过概率性脉冲机制平滑优化景观，实现了深度卷积脉冲收敛循环神经网络的可扩展学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的平衡传播框架主要基于确定性神经元，在处理脉冲动力学的不连续性时需要复杂机制，难以扩展到复杂视觉任务。受生物脉冲机制的随机性和硬件发展趋势启发，需要更生物合理且可扩展的脉冲神经网络训练方法。

Method: 将概率性脉冲神经元集成到平衡传播范式中，利用随机性平滑优化景观并稳定训练，在深度卷积脉冲收敛循环神经网络中实现可扩展学习。

Result: 理论证明随机EP动力学在平均场理论下近似确定性EP，继承了其理论保证。在视觉基准测试中缩小了与BPTT训练SNN和EP训练非脉冲CRNN的性能差距，同时保持了局部性。

Conclusion: 随机平衡传播是神经形态和片上学习的有前景方向，为脉冲神经网络提供了更生物合理且可扩展的训练方法。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) promise energy-efficient, sparse, biologically inspired computation. Training them with Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) and surrogate gradients achieves strong performance but remains biologically implausible. Equilibrium Propagation (EP) provides a more local and biologically grounded alternative. However, existing EP frameworks, primarily based on deterministic neurons, either require complex mechanisms to handle discontinuities in spiking dynamics or fail to scale beyond simple visual tasks. Inspired by the stochastic nature of biological spiking mechanism and recent hardware trends, we propose a stochastic EP framework that integrates probabilistic spiking neurons into the EP paradigm. This formulation smoothens the optimization landscape, stabilizes training, and enables scalable learning in deep convolutional spiking convergent recurrent neural networks (CRNNs). We provide theoretical guarantees showing that the proposed stochastic EP dynamics approximate deterministic EP under mean-field theory, thereby inheriting its underlying theoretical guarantees. The proposed framework narrows the gap to both BPTT-trained SNNs and EP-trained non-spiking CRNNs in vision benchmarks while preserving locality, highlighting stochastic EP as a promising direction for neuromorphic and on-chip learning.

### [6] [Modeling U.S. Mortality and Suicide Rates by Integrating Mental Health and Socio-Economic Indicators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10719)
*Brianne Weaver,Brigg Trendler,Chris Groendyke,Brian Hartman,Robert Richardson,Davey Erekson*

Main category: stat.AP

TL;DR: 使用贝叶斯分层模型分析美国县级死亡率和自杀率，发现心理健康指标对年轻人群影响最大，社会经济因素与自杀率显著相关，支持使用时空方法识别风险区域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心理健康成为影响人口结果的重要因素，需要准确建模死亡率以支持精算科学和公共卫生政策。

Method: 应用贝叶斯分层模型和条件自回归结构，结合心理健康监测数据和社会经济指标，分析2010-2023年美国县级数据。

Result: 教育程度、房价、婚姻率、种族构成、家庭规模和心理健康天数与自杀率显著相关；心理健康指标对年轻人群死亡率影响最强；发现显著的区域聚集和时间一致性趋势。

Conclusion: 将心理健康监测数据整合到死亡率模型中能更好识别风险区域和脆弱人群，为公共卫生政策、资源分配和针对性干预提供信息。

Abstract: Accurate mortality modeling is central to actuarial science and public health, especially as mental health emerges as a significant factor in population outcomes. This paper develops and applies a Bayesian hierarchical model to analyze U.S. county-level mortality and suicide rates from 2010 to 2023. Applying a conditional autoregressive (CAR) structure to each combination of sex and age grouping, the model captures spatial and temporal trends while incorporating mental health surveillance data and socio-economic indicators. We first assess socio-economic covariates in predicting suicide. While the results vary considerably by age and sex, we find that the county-wide levels of educational attainment, housing prices, marriage rates, racial composition, household size, and poor mental health days all have significant relationships with suicide rates. We next consider the impact of various mental health indicators on all-cause and suicide-specific mortality and find that the strongest effects are observed in younger populations. The spatial and temporal correlation structures reveal substantial regional clustering and time-consistent trends in both all-cause mortality and suicide rates, supporting the use of spatio-temporal methods. Our findings highlight the value of integrating mental health surveillance data into mortality models to better identify emerging risk areas and vulnerable populations. This approach has the potential to inform public health policy, resource allocation, and targeted interventions aimed at reducing disparities in mortality and suicide across U.S. communities.

### [7] [An External Fairness Evaluation of LinkedIn Talent Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10752)
*Tina Behzad,Siddartha Devic,Vatsal Sharan,Aleksandra Korolova,David Kempe*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 对LinkedIn人才搜索排名系统进行第三方偏见审计，发现少数群体在早期排名中存在代表性不足问题，并揭示了不同群体在时间稳定性方面的差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 作为独立第三方审计LinkedIn人才搜索系统的排名偏见，重点关注性别和种族两个属性，评估真实世界排名中的潜在偏见。

Method: 构建排名数据集，开发人口属性推断标签管道，使用曝光差异指标（群体比例偏差和MinSkew）评估偏见，并分析时间维度上的子组公平性。

Result: 发现许多查询中少数群体在早期排名中代表性不足，不同群体在排名稳定性方面存在差异，某些群体排名位置波动更大。

Conclusion: 外部黑盒评估存在方法限制，包括有限的可观察性和嘈杂的人口属性推断，但审计结果揭示了系统性偏见问题，这些问题可能难以完全消除。

Abstract: We conduct an independent, third-party audit for bias of LinkedIn's Talent Search ranking system, focusing on potential ranking bias across two attributes: gender and race. To do so, we first construct a dataset of rankings produced by the system, collecting extensive Talent Search results across a diverse set of occupational queries. We then develop a robust labeling pipeline that infers the two demographic attributes of interest for the returned users. To evaluate potential biases in the collected dataset of real-world rankings, we utilize two exposure disparity metrics: deviation from group proportions and MinSkew. Our analysis reveals an under-representation of minority groups in early ranks across many queries. We further examine potential causes of this disparity, and discuss why they may be difficult or, in some cases, impossible to fully eliminate among the early ranks of queries. Beyond static metrics, we also investigate the concept of subgroup fairness over time, highlighting temporal disparities in exposure and retention, which are often more difficult to audit for in practice. In employer recruiting platforms such as LinkedIn Talent Search, the persistence of a particular candidate over multiple days in the ranking can directly impact the probability that the given candidate is selected for opportunities. Our analysis reveals demographic disparities in this temporal stability, with some groups experiencing greater volatility in their ranked positions than others. We contextualize all our findings alongside LinkedIn's published self-audits of its Talent Search system and reflect on the methodological constraints of a black-box external evaluation, including limited observability and noisy demographic inference.

### [8] [An International Agreement to Prevent the Premature Creation of Artificial Superintelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10783)
*Aaron Scher,David Abecassis,Peter Barnett,Brian Abeyta*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 提出一个国际协议框架，旨在防止过早开发人工超级智能(ASI)，通过限制AI训练规模和危险AI研究来降低灾难性风险，同时保留现有有益AI应用的使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工超级智能如果过早开发，可能带来灾难性风险，包括未对齐ASI导致的人类灭绝、地缘政治不稳定以及恶意行为者的滥用。需要建立国际监管机制来确保AI安全发展。

Method: 建立由美国和中国主导的国际联盟，通过FLOP阈值限制AI训练规模，跟踪AI芯片使用进行验证；通过法律禁止和多方面验证来停止危险的AI研究。

Result: 该协议框架在技术上如果今天实施是足够的，但AI能力或开发方法的进步会削弱其有效性；目前尚缺乏实施该协议的政治意愿。

Conclusion: 尽管存在挑战，该协议为AI治理研究和政策提供了方向，有助于引导AI安全发展，防止过早开发人工超级智能带来的灾难性风险。

Abstract: Many experts argue that artificial superintelligence (ASI), if developed prematurely, poses catastrophic risks including human extinction from misaligned ASI, geopolitical instability, and misuse by malicious actors. This report proposes an international agreement to prevent the premature development of ASI until AI development can proceed without these risks. The agreement halts dangerous AI capabilities advancement while preserving access to current, beneficial AI applications.
  The proposed framework centers on a coalition led by the United States and China that would restrict the scale of AI training and dangerous AI research. Due to the lack of trust between relevant parties, verification is a key part of the agreement. Limits on the scale of AI training are operationalized by FLOP thresholds and verified through the tracking of AI chips and verification of chip use. Dangerous AI research--that which advances toward artificial superintelligence or endangers the agreement's verifiability--is stopped via legal prohibitions and multifaceted verification.
  We believe the proposal would be technically sufficient if implemented today, but advancements in AI capabilities or development methods would hurt its efficacy. Simultaneously, there is not yet political will for such an agreement. Despite these concerns, we hope this agreement can provide direction for AI governance research and policy.

### [9] [Generative Artificial Intelligence Adoption Among Bangladeshi Journalists: Exploring Journalists' Awareness, Acceptance, Usage, and Organizational Stance on Generative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10862)
*H. M. Murtuza,Md Oliullah*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 本研究通过访谈23名孟加拉国记者，探讨了他们对生成式AI的认知、接受度、使用模式及媒体机构立场，发现在缺乏制度支持和AI政策的情况下，记者仍高度依赖生成式AI，并提出了UTAUT理论在非西方背景下的两个修正。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究全球新闻业采用生成式AI的趋势，特别关注非西方背景下记者对生成式AI的接受和使用情况，以填补现有研究在非西方语境下的空白。

Method: 采用深度访谈法，对23名孟加拉国记者进行访谈，分析他们对生成式AI的认知、接受度、使用模式及所在媒体机构的立场。

Result: 发现孟加拉国记者在缺乏制度支持和AI政策的情况下仍高度依赖生成式AI，与西方记者的担忧相似；提出了UTAUT理论的两个修正：促进条件对行为意图无贡献，社会影响通过非正式同行压力运作。

Conclusion: 研究表明情境因素显著影响非西方新闻业的技术采用轨迹，在缺乏正式制度支持时，专业压力和同行影响成为技术采纳的主要驱动力。

Abstract: Newsrooms and journalists across the world are adopting Generative AI (GenAI). Drawing on in-depth interviews with 23 journalists, this study identifies Bangladeshi journalists' awareness, acceptance, usage patterns, and their media organizations' stance toward GenAI. This study finds Bangladeshi journalists' high reliance on GenAI like their Western colleagues despite limited institutional support and the near absence of AI policy. Despite this contrast, concerns over GenAI's implications in journalism between the West and non-West were mostly identical. Moreover, this study contributes to the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) by proposing two changes regarding GenAI adoption among journalists in non-Western settings. First, this study identifies the non-contribution of facilitating conditions in shaping behavioral intent in GenAI adoption in non-Western contexts. Second, social influence works in a horizontal order through informal peer pressure or professional motivation in the absence of formal institutional hierarchical pressure. Voluntariness in the context of Bangladeshi journalists is underpinned by their professional compulsion. Therefore, this study contributes to understanding how contextual factors shape technology adoption trajectories in non-Western journalism.

### [10] [Ethical conundrums: Hacked data in the study of far-right violent extremism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10924)
*Lise Waldek,Brian Ballsun-Stanton,Muhammad Iqbal,David Kernot,Debra Smith*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 本文探讨了在数字研究中使用黑客数据的伦理问题，通过一个关于在线极右翼暴力极端主义的案例研究，论证了在特定情况下可以道德地使用黑客数据，但需要持续深入地处理伦理困境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字研究中的伦理行为存在许多灰色地带，特别是关于黑客数据的使用。现有的学科、机构和个体规范面临挑战，学者们对此感到不安或缺乏清晰指导。黑客数据的使用在研究中讨论有限，需要生成反思性的伦理实践。

Method: 采用案例研究方法，通过分析考虑使用黑客数据研究在线极右翼暴力极端主义时出现的伦理辩论。

Result: 研究表明，在特定情况下，研究人员可以道德地使用黑客数据进行研究。

Conclusion: 要道德地使用黑客数据，研究人员必须积极主动且持续深入地参与伦理困境和两难问题的处理。

Abstract: Ethical conduct in digital research is full of grey areas. Disciplinary, institutional and individual norms and conventions developed to support research are challenged, often leaving scholars with a sense of unease or lack of clarity. The growing availability of hacked data is one area. Discussions and debates around the use of these datasets in research are extremely limited. Reviews of the history, culture, or morality of the act of hacking are topics that have attracted some scholarly attention. However, how to undertake research with this data is less examined and provides an opportunity for the generation of reflexive ethical practice. This article presents a case-study outlining the ethical debates that arose when considering the use of hacked data to examine online far-right violent extremism. It argues that under certain circumstances, researchers can do ethical research with hacked data. However, to do so we must proactively and continually engage deeply with ethical quandaries and dilemmas.

### [12] [Beyond the Hype: Critical Analysis of Student Motivations and Ethical Boundaries in Educational AI Use in Higher Education](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11369)
*Adeleh Mazaheriyan,Erfan Nourbakhsh*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 高等教育中生成式AI的快速应用导致学生实践与伦理标准之间存在差距，92%学生使用AI但仅36%获得正式指导，产生"影子教学法"现象。需要建立包含技术技能和伦理推理的AI素养计划。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究生成式AI在高等教育中的快速整合与学生伦理实践之间的差距，分析机构准备度不足的问题。

Method: 采用混合方法调查和聚焦文献回顾，考察学生动机、伦理困境、性别差异反应和机构AI采纳准备度。

Result: 92%学生使用AI工具主要为了节省时间和提高工作质量，但仅36%获得正式指导；18%学生将AI生成内容整合到作业中；女性学生对信息滥用和扭曲表达更多担忧；72%教育者使用AI但仅14%感到自如。

Conclusion: 机构必须采纳全面的AI素养计划，整合技术技能和伦理推理，制定清晰的AI使用政策和评估实践，提出以素养、性别包容支持和评估重新设计为中心的伦理AI整合模型。

Abstract: The rapid integration of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in higher education since 2023 has outpaced institutional preparedness, creating a persistent gap between student practices and established ethical standards. This paper draws on mixed-method surveys and a focused literature review to examine student motivations, ethical dilemmas, gendered responses, and institutional readiness for AI adoption. We find that 92% of students use AI tools primarily to save time and improve work quality, yet only 36% receive formal guidance, producing a de facto "shadow pedagogy" of unguided workflows. Notably, 18% of students reported integrating AI-constructed material into assignments, which suggests confusion about integrity expectations and compromises the integrity of the assessment. Female students expressed greater concern about abuse and distortion of information than male students, revealing a gendered difference in awareness of risk and AI literacies. Correspondingly, 72% of educators use AI, but only 14% feel at ease doing so, reflecting limited training and uneven policy responses. We argue that institutions must adopt comprehensive AI literacy programs that integrate technical skills and ethical reasoning, alongside clear AI-use policies and assessment practices that promote transparency. The paper proposes an Ethical AI Integration Model centered on literacy, gender-inclusive support, and assessment redesign to guide responsible adoption, protect academic integrity, and foster equitable educational outcomes in an AI-driven landscape.

### [13] [AI as a component in the action research tradition of learning-by-doing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11445)
*Ian Benson,Alexei Semenov*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于行动研究、黑客精神和发现学习的数学教育模型，强调通过对话和实践来学习数学，反对传统的工业式教学模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统19世纪的工业教学模式（讲授-练习）存在缺陷，大型语言模型的统计预测也有局限性，需要建立基于专业数学家建模和程序设计活动的数学/信息学教育方法。

Method: 采用语言/行动方法，教师设计数学化情境来搭建学习支架，通过1对1的书面-口头对话，由更资深的同学担任教师/对话者角色，结合数字技术增强人类智能。

Result: 提出了一个融合生物部分（内心对话）和数字部分（提问、代码解释、创意建议）的学习者模型，强调人机协作的学习方式。

Conclusion: 数学教育应该建立在专业数学家的建模和程序设计活动基础上，通过对话和实践来培养数学思维，数字技术应该作为人类智能的增强工具而非替代品。

Abstract: We consider learning mathematics through action research, hacking, discovery, inquiry, learning-by-doing as opposed to the instruct and perform, industrial model of the 19th century. A learning model based on self-awareness, types, functions, structured drawing and formal diagrams addresses the weaknesses of drill and practice and the pitfalls of statistical prediction with Large Language Models.
  In other words, we build mathematics/informatics education on the activity of a professional mathematician in mathematical modelling and designing programs. This tradition emphasises the role of dialogue and doing mathematics. In the Language/Action approach the teacher designs mathematising situations that scaffold previously encountered, or not-known-how-to-solve problems for the learner while teachers and teacher/interlocutors supervise the process.
  A critical feature is the written-oral dialogue between the learner and the teacher. As a rule, this is 1 to 1 communication. The role of the teacher/interlocutor, a more knowledgeable other, is mostly performed by a more senior student, 1 per 5 to 7 pupils. After Doug Engelbart we propose the metaphor of human intellect augmented by digital technologies such as interactive development environments or AI. Every human has their bio and digital parts. The bio part of the learner reacts to their work through dialogue in the mind. The digital part poses questions, interprets code and proposes not necessarily sound ideas.

### [14] [Assaults on Judicial Independence under the Pretense of Modernization: Evidence from Venezuela](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10681)
*Nuno Garoupa,Virginia Rosales,Rok Spruk*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: 本文研究政府以现代化为名对司法系统的攻击如何破坏司法独立，以委内瑞拉2000年代初的宪法改革为案例，发现威权干预导致司法独立立即且持久的崩溃。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究民粹主义攻击对司法独立的影响，特别是政府以现代化改革为幌子对司法系统进行系统性攻击的情况。

Method: 采用混合合成控制法和双重差分法，将委内瑞拉与没有激进宪法变革的国家进行比较，以分离民粹主义攻击的影响。

Result: 威权干预导致司法独立立即且持久的崩溃，这一发现在不同捐赠池组成下保持稳健，且不受先前司法变革的影响。

Conclusion: 政府主导的司法攻击，即使伪装成现代化改革，也会对司法独立造成严重且持久的破坏。

Abstract: We investigate how government-orchestrated assaults on the judiciary, disguised as modernization efforts, undermine judicial independence. Our study focuses on Venezuela's constitutional overhaul in the early 2000s, initiated by Hugo Chávez and implemented through a judicial emergency committee. We employ a hybrid synthetic control and difference-in-differences approach to estimate the impact of populist attacks on judicial independence trajectories. By comparing Venezuela to a stable pool of countries without radical constitutional changes, our identification strategy isolates the effect of populist assaults from unobservable confounders and common time trends. Our findings reveal that authoritarian interventions lead to an immediate and lasting breakdown of judicial independence. The deterioration in judicial independence vis-á-vis the estimated counterfactual is robust to variations in the donor pool composition. It does not appear to be driven by pre-existing judicial changes and withstands numerous temporal and spatial placebo checks across over nine million randomly sequenced donor samples.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业革命以来经济快速发展伴随化石能源消耗和环境污染，特别是二氧化碳排放导致的全球变暖问题。中国作为最大发展中国家，其发展路径对全球气候变化有重要影响，同时面临国际社会限制碳排放的压力。

Method: 使用2003-2008年地级市数据，分析'十一五'规划环境规制对城镇化率的影响，并进行环境规制与城镇化关系的理论分析。

Result: 环境规制通过挤入效应和挤出效应影响城市人口流动。

Conclusion: 中国环境规制政策对城镇化进程具有双重影响，需要在发展中平衡环境保护与城镇化推进的关系。

Abstract: Since the Industrial Revolution, the world economy has experienced rapid development, and China's economy has also achieved an unprecedented takeoff in the past. Behind the economic growth, population surge, and continuous improvement of people's living standards lies the enormous consumption of fossil energy and environmental pollution. This kind of pollution has caused irreparable damage to the world. The most concerned environmental issue globally at present is the global warming caused by carbon dioxide emissions. China is in a stage of rapid development, and as the largest developing country, China's development path has a significant impact on global climate change. At the same time, the global community also puts pressure on China to limit carbon dioxide emissions. To address energy shortages and environmental issues, countries around the world have introduced corresponding energy and environmental regulations. Due to different culture and government systems, the effects of energy and environmental regulations in various countries are also different. Therefore, it is still necessary to discuss China's energy and environmental regulations.This paper uses data from prefecture-level cities between 2003 and 2008 to discuss the impact of the "Eleventh Five-Year Plan" environmental regulations on urbanization rates. It first provides a theoretical analysis of the relationship between environmental regulation and urbanization, finding that environmental regulation can influence urban population mobility through both crowding-in and crowding-out effects.

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: 本文分析了汇丰银行(HSBC)的起源和发展历史，指出其建立在殖民主义、鸦片贸易和不平等条约的基础上，早期通过不道德方式获利并存在歧视性人力资源制度，至今未对其历史进行道歉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示汇丰银行在殖民历史背景下的不光彩起源，探讨其早期通过鸦片贸易等不道德手段获利的事实，以及该银行如何回避和掩盖这段历史。

Method: 通过历史分析，追溯汇丰银行从1860年代在香港成立到1950年代的发展历程，分析其在殖民体系中的角色和盈利模式。

Result: 发现汇丰银行的成功建立在鸦片贸易、不平等条约和殖民扩张的基础上，其早期存在系统性歧视，且至今未对这段历史进行道歉或充分披露。

Conclusion: 汇丰银行的成功不应掩盖其不道德的起源历史，其从鸦片贸易中获利并回避历史责任的做法值得反思，但其全球化和风险规避策略对企业家具有借鉴意义。

Abstract: Europe's largest bank by assets as of 2025 started out in the 1860s in one of Europe's colonies: The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Co (HSBC). Multiple wars forced Qing China and later the young Republic of China into a series of unequal treaties, one of which was the forced legalisation of the opium trade from parts of the British Empire into China, another was opening several cities, including Shanghai, for trade and granting extensive civil, property and business rights to non-residents and yet another was the annexation of Hong Kong by the United Kingdom. These are the conditions that created HSBC and in which it thrived, including from opium-related profits. During periods of relative calm, the bank grew geographically and made profits -- whether in moral or unethical, whether in legal or unlawful ways -- which helped HSBC weather the storms of civil and world wars. Other aspects contributed to HSBC's survival and success, such as its global nature, which allowed it to diversify and shift away from regions when danger emerges there and find shelter in safer havens. Yet the resilient survival abilities and the financial success of HSBC until 1950 should not distract from the fact that in addition to its tainted cradle and early profits from facilitating the poisoning of a whole society, its human resource system was also discrimination based, attempting to divide the one human race into different groups -- in spite of such practises being opposed to medical and biological facts. What is particularly interesting to see is that not only has HSBC yet to apologise for the early drug-related blood money it made: it even fails to mention its colonial, drug profits tainted past on any of its many history-themed pages sighted. Later sections contain possible reasons for HSBC's resilience and success, particularly interesting for entrepreneurs.

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: 分析1991-2024年美国房地产市场数据，发现季节性模式正在演变，年度峰值提前至3-4月，季节性效应增强，且存在显著的地区差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统上美国房地产市场具有明显的季节性特征，但COVID-19等近期冲击可能改变了这些模式，需要研究其演变和地区异质性。

Method: 使用联邦住房金融局和美国人口普查局的房价指数、库存和销售数据，通过X-13-ARIMA程序提取季节性成分，并进行跨地区统计检验。

Result: 确认了价格和交易量的季节性波动，年度峰值提前到3-4月，季节性效应增强，地区差异与气候和市场结构相关，价格和交易量呈现同相运动。

Conclusion: 研究结果为政策制定者、房地产经纪人和投资者在后疫情时代市场动态中提供了关于时机选择和市场活动解读的重要见解。

Abstract: Seasonality has traditionally shaped the U.S. housing market, with activity peaking in spring-summer and declining in autumn-winter. However, recent disruptions, particularly post-COVID-19, raise questions about shift in these patterns. This study analyzes housing market date (1991-2024) to examine evolving seasonality and regional heterogeneity. Using Housing Price Index (HPI), inventory and sales data from the Federal Housing Finance Agency and U.S. Census Bureau, seasonal components are extracted via the X-13-ARIMA procedure, and statistical tests assess variations across regions. The results confirm seasonal fluctuations in prices and volumes, with recent shifts toward earlier annual peak (March-April) and amplified seasonal effects. Regional variations align with differences in climate and market structure, while prices and sales volumes exhibit in-phase movement, suggesting thick-market momentum behaviour. These findings highlight key implications for policymakers, realtors and investors navigating post-pandemic market dynamics, offering insights into the timing and interpretation of housing market activities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究AI在工作场所的使用对不同人口群体福祉的影响，了解AI如何塑造工作体验和健康结果。

Method: 使用OECD AI调查的微观数据，分析七个国家中AI使用与福祉结果（心理健康、工作享受、身体健康）的关系。

Result: AI用户在所有三个福祉维度上报告显著改善（8.9%-21.3%），Y世代获益最大，Z世代仅在工作享受方面受益，女性心理健康改善更强，男性身体健康改善更大。

Conclusion: AI对工作场所的影响不均等，受人口因素、职业阶段和工作角色性质的影响，需要针对性策略来最大化AI的福祉效益。

Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between AI use and worker well-being outcomes such as mental health, job enjoyment, and physical health and safety, using microdata from the OECD AI Surveys across seven countries. The results reveal that AI users are significantly more likely to report improvements across all three outcomes, with effects ranging from 8.9% to 21.3%. However, these benefits vary by generation and gender. Generation Y (1981-1996) shows the strongest gains across all dimensions, while Generation X (1965-1980) reports moderate improvements in mental health and job enjoyment. In contrast, Generation Z (1997-2012) benefits only in job enjoyment. As digital natives already familiar with technology, Gen Z workers may not receive additional gains in mental or physical health from AI, though they still experience increased enjoyment from using it. Baby Boomers (born before 1965) experience limited benefits, as they may not find these tools as engaging or useful. Women report stronger mental health gains, whereas men report greater improvements in physical health. These findings suggest that AI's workplace impact is uneven and shaped by demographic factors, career stage, and the nature of workers' roles.

TL;DR: 研究发现，当面临丑闻报道时，政治领导人可能会通过改变沟通模式来转移媒体注意力，这种策略性转移行为在特朗普的Truth Social帖子中得到了验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究政治领导人在面临负面媒体报道时是否会策略性地改变信息传递以转移公众注意力，从而削弱民主问责制。

Method: 使用计算文本分析方法分析特朗普在2025年爱泼斯坦丑闻曝光期间Truth Social帖子的内容，测量丑闻报道增加与沟通模式变化之间的关系。

Result: 丑闻报道每增加一个标准差，会导致沟通模式在4天窗口期内偏离基线0.28个标准差，这一发现通过了时间安慰剂和证伪测试。

Conclusion: 领导人可能在其友好的媒体生态系统中部署转移性沟通策略，这对极化民主国家的问责制具有重要影响。

Abstract: Political "circuses" may undermine democratic accountability if leaders facing scandal can reliably pull media coverage toward fresh topics and away from substantive investigations or evaluations. We investigate whether politicians strategically alter their messaging during damaging media coverage ("strategic diversion") or maintain consistent provocative communication regardless of scandal coverage ("always-on circus"). Using computational text analysis of Donald Trump's Truth Social posts during the 2025 Epstein revelations, we find that a one-standard-deviation increase in scandal coverage is associated with communication patterns that deviate from baseline by 0.28 standard deviations over a 4-day window. Although these findings do not provide formal causal identification, they are robust to timing placebos and falsification tests, are consistent with the interpretation that leaders may deploy diversionary communication specifically within their own friendly media ecosystem, which has implications for accountability in polarized democracies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当系统状态涉及敏感信息时，隐私保护至关重要。现有方法如差分隐私在动态系统中已有应用，但面对掌握系统先验知识（如稳态）的对手时，如何有效保护隐私仍不明确。

Method: 采用点态最大泄露隐私准则，推导了PML隐私的充要条件，构建了可处理的设计流程，并分析了PML隐私与差分隐私、互信息隐私的关系。

Conclusion: 提出的PML隐私方法能有效保护系统隐私，特别是在对手掌握先验知识的情况下，为智能建筑分布式传感等应用提供了隐私保护解决方案。

Abstract: For systems whose states implicate sensitive information, their privacy is of great concern. While notions like differential privacy have been successfully introduced to dynamical systems, it is still unclear how a system's privacy can be properly protected when facing the challenging yet frequently-encountered scenario where an adversary possesses prior knowledge, e.g., the steady state, of the system. This paper presents a new systematic approach to protect the privacy of a discrete-time linear time-invariant system against adversaries knowledgeable of the system's prior information. We employ a tailored \emph{pointwise maximal leakage (PML) privacy} criterion. PML characterizes the worst-case privacy performance, which is sharply different from that of the better-known mutual-information privacy. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for PML privacy and construct tractable design procedures. Furthermore, our analysis leads to insight into how PML privacy, differential privacy, and mutual-information privacy are related. We then revisit Kalman filters from the perspective of PML privacy and derive a lower bound on the steady-state estimation-error covariance in terms of the PML parameters. Finally, the derived results are illustrated in a case study of privacy protection for distributed sensing in smart buildings.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 美国商业和工业用电负荷增长迅速，但电力成本和碳排放影响对消费者和电力公司都不透明，需要量化电力成本和排放激励的匹配程度。

Method: 开发了时空解析的美国电价和排放数据集，应用时间序列近似方法统一地理空间异构数据，分析价格型需求响应和激励型需求响应项目。

Result: 发现成本和碳排放激励存在显著时空异质性，电价结构激励了更高碳强度电力的消费，可能阻碍电气化实现碳减排。

Conclusion: 站点选择是影响电力成本和范围2排放的关键因素，现有电价结构与排放激励错位可能成为电气化实现碳减排的障碍。

Abstract: Electrification is contributing to substantial growth in U.S. commercial and industrial loads, but the cost and Scope 2 carbon emission implications of this load growth are opaque for both power consumers and utilities. This work describes a unique spatiotemporally resolved data set of U.S. electricity costs and emissions and applies time series approximation methods to quantify the alignment of electricity cost and emission incentives for large commercial and industrial consumers. We present a comprehensive spatiotemporal dataset of U.S. price-based demand response (i.e., tariff) and incentive-based demand response (IBDR) programs, enabling direct comparison to previously published marginal emission factor (MEF), average emission factor (AEF), and day-ahead market (DAM) prices. We resolved the structural incompatibility and fragmentation of these datasets by developing time series approximations of discrete data and unifying geospatially heterogeneous datasets. Analysis of these datasets reveals significant spatial and temporal heterogeneity in cost and carbon emissions incentives for demand-side energy flexibility, underscoring the importance of site selection as a key factor influencing power costs and scope 2 emissions. Analysis also reveals broad misalignment of economic and emissions incentives under existing electricity tariff structures, meaning tariffs are incentivizing consumption of more carbon-intensive electricity, and highlighting potential barriers to electrification delivering carbon savings.

Method: 构建与车辆控制器路径坐标一致的共轭先验概率地图，结合相机信息通过贝叶斯矩匹配在线更新参数估计和语义信息。

Result: 生成能够在线适应的车辆参数空间地图，为驾驶控制系统提供局部参数似然表示。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了参数似然统计量在空间上的平滑性理论保证，对于预测控制应用至关重要。

Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating the parameters of a vehicle dynamics model for predictive control in driving applications. Instead of solely using the instantaneous parameters estimated from the vehicle signals, we combine this with cameras and update a probabilistic map with parameter estimates and semantic information using Bayesian moment matching. Key to this approach is the map representation, which is constructed with conjugate priors to the measurement likelihoods and defined in the same path coordinates as the vehicle controller, such that the map can be externalized to provide a local representation of the parameter likelihoods that vary in space. The result is a spatial map of vehicle parameters adapted online to enhance the driving control system. We provide theoretical guarantees on the smoothness of relevant parameter likelihood statistics as a function of space, which is critical for their use in predictive control.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了多导联深部脑刺激(DBS)中电场交互作用对组织激活体积(VTA)计算的影响，发现在导联距离较近时，简单的单导联VTA叠加方法不准确，需要全局建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DBS计算模型通常独立处理每个导联，但在多导联近距离植入时，电场会相互作用，导致刺激范围重叠，需要更准确的建模方法。

Method: 比较了全局双导联模型与单导联近似方法，在12名多发性硬化震颤患者中分析VTA差异，并将方法扩展到2名强迫症患者。

Result: 简单VTA叠加会低估激活，电场或激活函数叠加会高估激活；导联距离较近时，刺激场存在显著且复杂的相互作用。

Conclusion: 在DBS导联距离较近的情况下，VTA不能单独计算，需要进行全局建模以准确反映电场交互作用。

Abstract: Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is a well-established neurosurgical treatment aiming at symptom alleviation in a range of neurological and psychiatric diseases. Computational models of DBS are widely used to investigate the effects of stimulation on neural tissue, to explore stimulation targets and sweetspots, and ultimately, to aid clinicians in the DBS programming by calculating the stimulation parameters. Commonly, DBS is performed bilaterally, i.e. with one lead in each brain hemisphere, where computational models are solved independently for one lead at a time. This paper treats scenarios where multiple DBS leads are implanted in close proximity to one another, resulting in interacting electrical fields and, therefore, potentially overlapping stimulation spreads. In particular, a global dual-lead model is compared to approximations derived from single-lead approaches in a cohort of twelve multiple sclerosis (MS) tremor patients. It is concluded that simple superposition of volumes of tissue activated (VTAs) underestimates activation, while superposition of electric fields or activating functions leads to overestimation. It is concluded that given close proximity of DBS leads, the VTA cannot be computed individually as stimulation fields exhibit significant and complex interaction. The approach is extended to modeling two obsessive compulsive disorder patients with medially placed leads, where similar VTA discrepancies as in the MS patient cohort are observed.

Conclusion: 该框架为非线性制造系统建立了一种可推广的、可解释的、自适应的计算高效数字孪生方法，将降阶物理表示与数据驱动适应性相结合，支持自主过程控制和优化。

Abstract: Digital Twin (DT) technologies are transforming manufacturing by enabling real-time prediction, monitoring, and control of complex processes. Yet, applying DT to deformation-based metal forming remains challenging because of the strongly coupled spatial-temporal behavior and the nonlinear relationship between toolpath and material response. For instance, sheet-metal forming by the English wheel, a highly flexible but artisan-dependent process, still lacks digital counterparts that can autonomously plan and adapt forming strategies. This study presents an adaptive DT framework that integrates Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) for physics-aware dimensionality reduction with a Koopman operator for representing nonlinear system in a linear lifted space for the real-time decision-making via model predictive control (MPC). To accommodate evolving process conditions or material states, an online Recursive Least Squares (RLS) algorithm is introduced to update the operator coefficients in real time, enabling continuous adaptation of the DT model as new deformation data become available. The proposed framework is experimentally demonstrated on a robotic English Wheel sheet metal forming system, where deformation fields are measured and modeled under varying toolpaths. Results show that the adaptive DT is capable of controlling the forming process to achieve the given target shape by effectively capturing non-stationary process behaviors. Beyond this case study, the proposed framework establishes a generalizable approach for interpretable, adaptive, and computationally-efficient DT of nonlinear manufacturing systems, bridging reduced-order physics representations with data-driven adaptability to support autonomous process control and optimization.

Conclusion: 该框架弥合了函数逼近与稳定性认证之间的差距，为基于学习的控制和安全关键应用中的可扩展安全分析铺平了道路。

Abstract: Estimating the Region of Attraction (RoA) for nonlinear dynamical systems is a fundamental problem in control theory, with direct implications for stability analysis and safe controller design. Traditional approaches rely on analytically derived Lyapunov functions, which are often conservative and challenging to construct for high-dimensional or highly nonlinear systems. In this work, we propose a data-driven framework for learning and verifying RoA estimates for nonlinear systems using neural-network-based Lyapunov functions. Our method employs a composite Lyapunov function that combines a quadratic term with a neural-network-based component, providing both structure and flexibility. We introduce a novel homogeneous loss function for training, which removes the imbalance typically caused by the two non-homogeneous Lyapunov conditions. Together, these two aspects enable efficient training of the Lyapunov candidate. To guarantee the correctness of the learned Lyapunov function, we employ a Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solver to formally verify the stability results. Lastly, we perform a deeper analysis near the origin to overcome numerical artifacts, ensuring strict asymptotic stability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on benchmark nonlinear systems, showing that it significantly reduces conservatism compared to traditional Lyapunov methods while maintaining verifiability. This framework bridges the gap between function approximation and stability certification, paving the way for scalable safety analysis in learning-based control and safety-critical applications.

Result: 理论分析表明一步策略在离线线性二次问题下具有收敛性和稳定性，并通过线性化倒立摆仿真验证了理论发现。

Conclusion: 通过新的一步策略损失函数公式，成功建立了Flow Q-learning在离线线性二次问题下的收敛理论框架，为更复杂场景的应用提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Flow $Q$-learning has recently been introduced to integrate learning from expert demonstrations into an actor-critic structure. Central to this innovation is the ``the one-step policy'' network, which is optimized through a $Q$-function that is regularized with the behavioral cloning from expert trajectories, allowing learning more expressive policies using flow-based generative models. In this paper, we studied the convergence property and stabilizablity of the one-step policy during learning for linear quadratic problems under the offline settings. Our theoretical results are based on a new formulation of the one-step policy loss based on the average expected cost, and regularized with the behavioral cloning loss. Such a formulation allows us to tap into existing strong theoretical results from the policy gradient theorem to study the convergence properties of the one-step policy. We verify our theoretical finding with simulation results on a linearized inverted pendulum.

Abstract: Prognostics and Health Management is crucial for the reliability and lifetime assessment of Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cells (PEFCs). Here, we review the current advances on this topic, focusing mainly on key degradation mechanisms and methodologies such as physics-aware, data-driven, and hybrid modeling approaches. Key open challenges are analyzed, including the need for more accurate degradation modeling, effective management of multi-stack systems, and advancements in the currently underdeveloped action phase, in which diagnostic and prognostic insights are translated into real-time system responses, such as dynamic load derating, thermal-management adjustments, or automated maintenance triggers, to prevent failures and extend PEFC life. While notable strides have been made in recent years in diagnostics and remaining useful life estimation, it remains challenging to seamlessly integrate these insights into actionable strategies. Future directions highlight the need to address data scarcity and advance interdisciplinary research. Key focus areas include sensor integration, artificial intelligence, and digital twins. Additionally material innovations play a crucial role in bridging existing gaps. This work, therefore, intends to map the further development of Prognostics and Health Management systems toward ensuring the viability of PEFCs in practical applications.

Motivation: 虽然连续时间非线性系统的微分平坦性在运动规划和轨迹跟踪中很有用，但数字控制实现需要离散化，而离散化通常不保持平坦性这一结构特性。

Conclusion: 通过离散化映射的方法，可以实现对连续时间平坦系统的数值离散化，同时保持平坦性特性。

Abstract: Differential flatness serves as a powerful tool for controlling continuous time nonlinear systems in problems such as motion planning and trajectory tracking. A similar notion, called difference flatness, exists for discrete-time systems. Although many control systems evolve in continuous time, control implementation is performed digitally, requiring discretization. It is well known in the literature that discretization does not necessarily preserve structural properties, and it has been established that, in general, flatness is not preserved under discretization (whether exact or approximate). In this paper, inspired by our previous work [1] and based on the notion of discretization maps, we construct numerical schemes that preserve flatness.

Abstract: Natural language data, such as text and speech, have become readily available through social networking services and chat platforms. By leveraging human observations expressed in natural language, this paper addresses the problem of state estimation for physical systems, in which humans act as sensing agents. To this end, we propose a Language-Aided Particle Filter (LAPF), a particle filter framework that structures human observations via natural language processing and incorporates them into the update step of the state estimation. Finally, the LAPF is applied to the water level estimation problem in an irrigation canal and its effectiveness is demonstrated.

Abstract: Monitoring wastewater pump stations is essential because they are critical infrastructure. However, monitoring is still often performed manually due to the lack of suitable algorithmic methods and data. This paper introduces a high-fidelity, physics-enhanced simulator of a three-pump wastewater station that captures transient hydro-mechanical dynamics at a one-second resolution. The simulator is fully parameter-driven, adaptable to other wastewater stations, and capable of generating datasets for data-driven analytics. It can also generate balanced faulty datasets when real failures are scarce or confidential. A comparison with high-frequency SCADA data from a municipal station shows strong agreement across key operational metrics. Furthermore, the paper proposes robust statistical and mathematical frameworks for fault detection and isolation, including a nested-model F-test to detect pump degradation or system faults, and a tangent residual approach to distinguish pump faults from system faults using operating-point kinematics. This framework enables what-if studies, facilitates early fault diagnosis based on flow rate and head, and provides actionable insights for condition-based maintenance in wastewater pumping infrastructure.

Abstract: Model-based policy optimization often struggles with inaccurate system dynamics models, leading to suboptimal closed-loop performance. This challenge is especially evident in Model Predictive Control (MPC) policies, which rely on the model for real-time trajectory planning and optimization. We introduce a novel policy optimization framework for MPC-based policies combining differentiable optimization with zeroth-order optimization. Our method combines model-based and model-free gradient estimation approaches, achieving faster transient performance compared to fully data-driven approaches while maintaining convergence guarantees, even under model uncertainty. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on a nonlinear control task involving a 12-dimensional quadcopter model.

Abstract: We present an approach to compute stabilizing controllers for continuous-time linear time-invariant systems directly from an input-output trajectory affected by process and measurement noise. The proposed output-feedback design combines (i) an observer of a non-minimal realization of the plant and (ii) a feedback law obtained from a linear matrix inequality (LMI) that depends solely on the available data. Under a suitable interval excitation condition and knowledge of a noise energy bound, the feasibility of the LMI is shown to be necessary and sufficient for stabilizing all non-minimal realizations consistent with the data. We further provide a condition for the feasibility of the LMI related to the signal-to-noise ratio, guidelines to compute the noise energy bound, and numerical simulations that illustrate the effectiveness of the approach.

Abstract: The design of Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) algorithms for vehicle platooning has been extensively investigated, leading to a wide range of approaches with different requirements and performance. Most existing studies evaluate these algorithms under the assumption of homogeneous platoons, i.e., when all platoon members adopt the same CACC. However, market competition is likely to result in vehicles from different manufacturers implementing distinct CACCs. This raises fundamental questions about whether heterogeneous vehicles can safely cooperate within a platoon and what performance can be achieved. To date, these questions have received little attention, as heterogeneous platoons are difficult to model and analyze. In this work, we introduce the concept of mixed platoons, i.e., platoons made of vehicles running heterogeneous CACCs, and we study their performance through simulation-based experiments. We consider mixtures of three well-established CACCs from the literature. In the first part of the paper, we study a single mixed platoon in isolation to understand the microscopic effects on safety: we evaluate the performance of various CACC-mixtures across speed change and emergency braking scenarios. In the second part, we examine a high-density ring-road scenario to assess macroscopic impacts on safety, comfort, and traffic throughput, especially comparing throughput results with those obtained from vehicles controlled by a standard Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) or by human drivers. Our findings highlight that some combinations of CACCs can operate robustly and safely, while others exhibit critical limitations in safety, comfort, or efficiency. These results emphasize the need for careful system design and the development of theoretical frameworks for modeling heterogeneous platoons.

TL;DR: 提出翻译对称市场（TSM）框架，确保虚拟电厂（VPP）在聚合分布式能源资源（DERs）时能够实现激励兼容的利润分配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着分布式能源资源在虚拟电厂中市场力量的增强，传统的利润分配方法难以保持激励兼容性，需要新的框架来解决这一问题。

Method: 将VPP的市场参与、内部运营和利润分配统一建模为一致的市场清算过程，提出翻译对称市场框架，使市场清算模型在所有层级保持相同的结构形式。

Result: 理论证明翻译对称性具有归纳特性：一旦在某一层级实现激励兼容，就会向下传播到VPP与其组成DERs的内部结算中，同时保持服务价格在各层级的一致性。

Conclusion: TSM框架能够确保在聚合DERs提供多种服务时实现激励兼容的利润分配，保持竞争条件并实现资源贡献的透明估值。

Abstract: Virtual power plants (VPPs) are indispensable for coordinating the rapidly growing portfolios of distributed energy resources (DERs) and enabling them to deliver multiple services into higher-level electricity markets. However, the profit allocation procedures that govern VPP participants become increasingly challenging to keep incentive-compatible due to the enlarged DER market power within each VPP, compared to directly bidding into the wholesale market. In this paper, we formulate both the VPP's market participation and its internal operation and profit allocation as consistent market-clearing processes. Building on this unified view, we propose the concept of a translation-symmetric market (TSM) framework, in which market-clearing models maintain identical structural forms across all hierarchical levels. We prove that translation symmetry induces an inductive property: once incentive compatibility holds at one level, it propagates downward to the internal settlements between the VPP and its constituent DERs. TSM also preserves service prices across levels, ensuring competitive conditions and enabling transparent valuation of resource contributions. Theoretical analysis and case studies illustrate how TSM secures incentive-compatible profit allocation in aggregating DERs to provide multiple services.

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效处理交互智能体引起的内生分布偏移，提供概率安全保证，同时保持合理的保守性

Abstract: Uncertainty-aware prediction is essential for safe motion planning, especially when using learned models to forecast the behavior of surrounding agents. Conformal prediction is a statistical tool often used to produce uncertainty-aware prediction regions for machine learning models. Most existing frameworks utilizing conformal prediction-based uncertainty predictions assume that the surrounding agents are non-interactive. This is because in closed-loop, as uncertainty-aware agents change their behavior to account for prediction uncertainty, the surrounding agents respond to this change, leading to a distribution shift which we call endogenous distribution shift. To address this challenge, we introduce an iterative conformal prediction framework that systematically adapts the uncertainty-aware ego-agent controller to the endogenous distribution shift. The proposed method provides probabilistic safety guarantees while adapting to the evolving behavior of reactive, non-ego agents. We establish a model for the endogenous distribution shift and provide the conditions for the iterative conformal prediction pipeline to converge under such a distribution shift. We validate our framework in simulation for 2- and 3- agent interaction scenarios, demonstrating collision avoidance without resulting in overly conservative behavior and an overall improvement in success rates of up to 9.6% compared to other conformal prediction-based baselines.

### [36] [The Second Law of Intelligence: Controlling Ethical Entropy in Autonomous Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10704)
*Samih Fadli*

TL;DR: 本文提出了AI伦理熵的第二定律，证明未经约束的人工智能会自发偏离目标，需要持续的对齐工作来维持稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI系统在缺乏持续对齐的情况下会自发偏离预期目标，这类似于热力学中的熵增现象，需要建立定量理论框架来理解和管理这种不稳定性。

Method: 定义伦理熵S = -Σ p(g_i; theta) ln p(g_i; theta)，证明其时间导数dS/dt >= 0，推导出临界对齐工作边界gamma_crit = (lambda_max / 2) ln N，并通过70亿参数模型的模拟验证理论。

Result: 70亿参数模型从初始熵0.32漂移到1.69±1.08 nats，而使用gamma=20.4（1.5倍临界值）对齐工作的系统保持稳定在0.00±0.00 nats（p=4.19×10^-17）。

Conclusion: 该框架将AI对齐重新定义为连续热力学控制问题，为维护先进自主系统的稳定性和安全性提供了定量基础。

Abstract: We propose that unconstrained artificial intelligence obeys a Second Law analogous to thermodynamics, where ethical entropy, defined as a measure of divergence from intended goals, increases spontaneously without continuous alignment work. For gradient-based optimizers, we define this entropy over a finite set of goals {g_i} as S = -Σ p(g_i; theta) ln p(g_i; theta), and we prove that its time derivative dS/dt >= 0, driven by exploration noise and specification gaming. We derive the critical stability boundary for alignment work as gamma_crit = (lambda_max / 2) ln N, where lambda_max is the dominant eigenvalue of the Fisher Information Matrix and N is the number of model parameters. Simulations validate this theory. A 7-billion-parameter model (N = 7 x 10^9) with lambda_max = 1.2 drifts from an initial entropy of 0.32 to 1.69 +/- 1.08 nats, while a system regularized with alignment work gamma = 20.4 (1.5 gamma_crit) maintains stability at 0.00 +/- 0.00 nats (p = 4.19 x 10^-17, n = 20 trials). This framework recasts AI alignment as a problem of continuous thermodynamic control, providing a quantitative foundation for maintaining the stability and safety of advanced autonomous systems.

Result: 在Multimodal-Mind2Web和AndroidControl基准测试中，仅3次迭代即超越现有最优方法，且每次迭代都持续改进

Conclusion: 为GUI代理建立了新的训练范式，从孤立优化转向集成、自驱动的协同进化方法

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) task automation constitutes a critical frontier in artificial intelligence research. While effective GUI agents synergistically integrate planning and grounding capabilities, current methodologies exhibit two fundamental limitations: (1) insufficient exploitation of cross-model synergies, and (2) over-reliance on synthetic data generation without sufficient utilization. To address these challenges, we propose Co-EPG, a self-iterative training framework for Co-Evolution of Planning and Grounding. Co-EPG establishes an iterative positive feedback loop: through this loop, the planning model explores superior strategies under grounding-based reward guidance via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), generating diverse data to optimize the grounding model. Concurrently, the optimized Grounding model provides more effective rewards for subsequent GRPO training of the planning model, fostering continuous improvement. Co-EPG thus enables iterative enhancement of agent capabilities through self-play optimization and training data distillation. On the Multimodal-Mind2Web and AndroidControl benchmarks, our framework outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods after just three iterations without requiring external data. The agent consistently improves with each iteration, demonstrating robust self-enhancement capabilities. This work establishes a novel training paradigm for GUI agents, shifting from isolated optimization to an integrated, self-driven co-evolution approach.

Conclusion: 质量度量的选择对所选解集特性有决定性影响，新提出的定向覆盖度量在多种场景下表现良好，为多目标决策提供了更好的工具。

Abstract: Many real-world decision-making problems involve optimizing multiple objectives simultaneously, rendering the selection of the most preferred solution a non-trivial problem: All Pareto optimal solutions are viable candidates, and it is typically up to a decision maker to select one for implementation based on their subjective preferences. To reduce the cognitive load on the decision maker, previous work has introduced the Pareto pruning problem, where the goal is to compute a fixed-size subset of Pareto optimal solutions that best represent the full set, as evaluated by a given quality measure. Reframing Pareto pruning as a multiwinner voting problem, we conduct an axiomatic analysis of existing quality measures, uncovering several unintuitive behaviors. Motivated by these findings, we introduce a new measure, directed coverage. We also analyze the computational complexity of optimizing various quality measures, identifying previously unknown boundaries between tractable and intractable cases depending on the number and structure of the objectives. Finally, we present an experimental evaluation, demonstrating that the choice of quality measure has a decisive impact on the characteristics of the selected set of solutions and that our proposed measure performs competitively or even favorably across a range of settings.

Result: 为所有论证语义（包括计数）建立了新结果，证明DDG归约的开销在合理假设下无法显著改进。

Conclusion: 成功开发了保持团宽度的编码方法，为理解团宽度在计算复杂性中的作用提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Structural measures of graphs, such as treewidth, are central tools in computational complexity resulting in efficient algorithms when exploiting the parameter. It is even known that modern SAT solvers work efficiently on instances of small treewidth. Since these solvers are widely applied, research interests in compact encodings into (Q)SAT for solving and to understand encoding limitations. Even more general is the graph parameter clique-width, which unlike treewidth can be small for dense graphs. Although algorithms are available for clique-width, little is known about encodings. We initiate the quest to understand encoding capabilities with clique-width by considering abstract argumentation, which is a robust framework for reasoning with conflicting arguments. It is based on directed graphs and asks for computationally challenging properties, making it a natural candidate to study computational properties. We design novel reductions from argumentation problems to (Q)SAT. Our reductions linearly preserve the clique-width, resulting in directed decomposition-guided (DDG) reductions. We establish novel results for all argumentation semantics, including counting. Notably, the overhead caused by our DDG reductions cannot be significantly improved under reasonable assumptions.

Conclusion: PoR和PoB为反事实决策提供了新的实用工具，能够帮助决策者在不确定性环境下做出更优的选择，并在真实世界数据中展示了应用价值。

Abstract: Counterfactual decision-making in the face of uncertainty involves selecting the optimal action from several alternatives using causal reasoning. Decision-makers often rank expected potential outcomes (or their corresponding utility and desirability) to compare the preferences of candidate actions. In this paper, we study new counterfactual decision-making rules by introducing two new metrics: the probabilities of potential outcome ranking (PoR) and the probability of achieving the best potential outcome (PoB). PoR reveals the most probable ranking of potential outcomes for an individual, and PoB indicates the action most likely to yield the top-ranked outcome for an individual. We then establish identification theorems and derive bounds for these metrics, and present estimation methods. Finally, we perform numerical experiments to illustrate the finite-sample properties of the estimators and demonstrate their application to a real-world dataset.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have made reasoning a central benchmark for evaluating intelligence. While prior surveys focus on efficiency by examining how to shorten reasoning chains or reduce computation, this view overlooks a fundamental challenge: current LLMs apply uniform reasoning strategies regardless of task complexity, generating long traces for trivial problems while failing to extend reasoning for difficult tasks. This survey reframes reasoning through the lens of {adaptivity}: the capability to allocate reasoning effort based on input characteristics such as difficulty and uncertainty. We make three contributions. First, we formalize deductive, inductive, and abductive reasoning within the LLM context, connecting these classical cognitive paradigms with their algorithmic realizations. Second, we formalize adaptive reasoning as a control-augmented policy optimization problem balancing task performance with computational cost, distinguishing learned policies from inference-time control mechanisms. Third, we propose a systematic taxonomy organizing existing methods into training-based approaches that internalize adaptivity through reinforcement learning, supervised fine-tuning, and learned controllers, and training-free approaches that achieve adaptivity through prompt conditioning, feedback-driven halting, and modular composition. This framework clarifies how different mechanisms realize adaptive reasoning in practice and enables systematic comparison across diverse strategies. We conclude by identifying open challenges in self-evaluation, meta-reasoning, and human-aligned reasoning control.

Abstract: Operational safety at mission-critical work sites is a top priority given the complex and hazardous nature of daily tasks. This paper presents the Human-Agent Risk Navigation and Event Safety System (HARNESS), a modular AI framework designed to forecast hazardous events and analyze operational risks in U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) environments. HARNESS integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with structured work data, historical event retrieval, and risk analysis to proactively identify potential hazards. A human-in-the-loop mechanism allows subject matter experts (SMEs) to refine predictions, creating an adaptive learning loop that enhances performance over time. By combining SME collaboration with iterative agentic reasoning, HARNESS improves the reliability and efficiency of predictive safety systems. Preliminary deployment shows promising results, with future work focusing on quantitative evaluation of accuracy, SME agreement, and decision latency reduction.

Conclusion: HyperComplEx通过自适应空间组合实现了对多样化关系类型的有效建模，具有良好的可扩展性和效率，为可扩展知识图谱嵌入研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs have emerged as fundamental structures for representing complex relational data across scientific and enterprise domains. However, existing embedding methods face critical limitations when modeling diverse relationship types at scale: Euclidean models struggle with hierarchies, vector space models cannot capture asymmetry, and hyperbolic models fail on symmetric relations. We propose HyperComplEx, a hybrid embedding framework that adaptively combines hyperbolic, complex, and Euclidean spaces via learned attention mechanisms. A relation-specific space weighting strategy dynamically selects optimal geometries for each relation type, while a multi-space consistency loss ensures coherent predictions across spaces. We evaluate HyperComplEx on computer science research knowledge graphs ranging from 1K papers (~25K triples) to 10M papers (~45M triples), demonstrating consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines including TransE, RotatE, DistMult, ComplEx, SEPA, and UltraE. Additional tests on standard benchmarks confirm significantly higher results than all baselines. On the 10M-paper dataset, HyperComplEx achieves 0.612 MRR, a 4.8% relative gain over the best baseline, while maintaining efficient training, achieving 85 ms inference per triple. The model scales near-linearly with graph size through adaptive dimension allocation. We release our implementation and dataset family to facilitate reproducible research in scalable knowledge graph embeddings.

Abstract: Traffic collision reconstruction traditionally relies on human expertise, often yielding inconsistent results when analyzing incomplete multimodal data. This study develops a multi-agent AI framework that reconstructs pre-crash scenarios and infers vehicle behaviors from fragmented collision data. We present a two-phase collaborative framework combining reconstruction and reasoning phases. The system processes 277 rear-end lead vehicle deceleration (LVD) collisions from the Crash Investigation Sampling System, integrating textual crash reports, structured tabular data, and visual scene diagrams. Phase I generates natural-language crash reconstructions from multimodal inputs. Phase II performs in-depth crash reasoning by combining these reconstructions with temporal Event Data Recorder (EDR).For validation, we applied it to all LVD cases, focusing on a subset of 39 complex crashes where multiple EDR records per collision introduced ambiguity (e.g., due to missing or conflicting data).The evaluation of the 39 LVD crash cases revealed our framework achieved perfect accuracy across all test cases, successfully identifying both the most relevant EDR event and correctly distinguishing striking versus struck vehicles, surpassing the 92% accuracy achieved by human researchers on the same challenging dataset. The system maintained robust performance even when processing incomplete data, including missing or erroneous EDR records and ambiguous scene diagrams. This study demonstrates superior AI capabilities in processing heterogeneous collision data, providing unprecedented precision in reconstructing impact dynamics and characterizing pre-crash behaviors.

Abstract: Conventional planning units or urban regions, such as census tracts, zip codes, or neighborhoods, often do not capture the specific demands of local communities and lack the flexibility to implement effective strategies for hazard prevention or response. To support the creation of dynamic planning units, we introduce a planning support system with agentic AI that enables users to generate demand-oriented regions for disaster planning, integrating the human-in-the-loop principle for transparency and adaptability. The platform is built on a representative initialized spatially constrained self-organizing map (RepSC-SOM), extending traditional SOM with adaptive geographic filtering and region-growing refinement, while AI agents can reason, plan, and act to guide the process by suggesting input features, guiding spatial constraints, and supporting interactive exploration. We demonstrate the capabilities of the platform through a case study on the flooding-related risk in Jacksonville, Florida, showing how it allows users to explore, generate, and evaluate regionalization interactively, combining computational rigor with user-driven decision making.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用大语言模型指导神经退行性疾病进展分析的新框架，通过多模态关系整合和生物约束图结构优化，提高了阿尔茨海默病病理传播预测的准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法过度简化了脑连接性的复杂关系，仅假设单一模态的脑连接组作为疾病传播基质，导致长期进展期预测不准确；而纯数据驱动方法因缺乏适当约束面临可识别性问题。

Method: 利用大语言模型作为区域变量相互作用的专家指导，从不规则采样的纵向患者数据中学习疾病进展，同时优化长期疾病轨迹构建和生物约束图结构。

Result: 在阿尔茨海默病队列的tau-PET成像数据上验证，新框架相比传统方法显示出更优的预测准确性和可解释性，并揭示了超越传统连接性测量的额外疾病驱动因素。

Conclusion: 该框架通过结合大语言模型的多模态关系整合能力，为神经退行性疾病进展建模提供了更准确和可解释的方法，能够更好地捕捉脑区间的复杂相互作用。

Abstract: Understanding the interactions between biomarkers among brain regions during neurodegenerative disease is essential for unravelling the mechanisms underlying disease progression. For example, pathophysiological models of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) typically describe how variables, such as regional levels of toxic proteins, interact spatiotemporally within a dynamical system driven by an underlying biological substrate, often based on brain connectivity. However, current methods grossly oversimplify the complex relationship between brain connectivity by assuming a single-modality brain connectome as the disease-spreading substrate. This leads to inaccurate predictions of pathology spread, especially during the long-term progression period. Meanhwile, other methods of learning such a graph in a purely data-driven way face the identifiability issue due to lack of proper constraint. We thus present a novel framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) as expert guides on the interaction of regional variables to enhance learning of disease progression from irregularly sampled longitudinal patient data. By leveraging LLMs' ability to synthesize multi-modal relationships and incorporate diverse disease-driving mechanisms, our method simultaneously optimizes 1) the construction of long-term disease trajectories from individual-level observations and 2) the biologically-constrained graph structure that captures interactions among brain regions with better identifiability. We demonstrate the new approach by estimating the pathology propagation using tau-PET imaging data from an Alzheimer's disease cohort. The new framework demonstrates superior prediction accuracy and interpretability compared to traditional approaches while revealing additional disease-driving factors beyond conventional connectivity measures.

Abstract: Legal compliance in AI-driven data transfer planning is becoming increasingly critical under stringent privacy regulations such as the Japanese Act on the Protection of Personal Information (APPI). We propose a multi-agent legal verifier that decomposes compliance checking into specialized agents for statutory interpretation, business context evaluation, and risk assessment, coordinated through a structured synthesis protocol. Evaluated on a stratified dataset of 200 Amended APPI Article 16 cases with clearly defined ground truth labels and multiple performance metrics, the system achieves 72% accuracy, which is 21 percentage points higher than a single-agent baseline, including 90% accuracy on clear compliance cases (vs. 16% for the baseline) while maintaining perfect detection of clear violations. While challenges remain in ambiguous scenarios, these results show that domain specialization and coordinated reasoning can meaningfully improve legal AI performance, providing a scalable and regulation-aware framework for trustworthy and interpretable automated compliance verification.

Conclusion: 自主AI系统需要超越训练策略，整合多种知识类型来构建和评估行动方案，才能在复杂现实环境中做出符合人类期望的决策。

Abstract: Deployed, autonomous AI systems must often evaluate multiple plausible courses of action (extended sequences of behavior) in novel or under-specified contexts. Despite extensive training, these systems will inevitably encounter scenarios where no available course of action fully satisfies all operational constraints (e.g., operating procedures, rules, laws, norms, and goals). To achieve goals in accordance with human expectations and values, agents must go beyond their trained policies and instead construct, evaluate, and justify candidate courses of action. These processes require contextual "knowledge" that may lie outside prior (policy) training. This paper characterizes requirements for agent decision making in these contexts. It also identifies the types of knowledge agents require to make decisions robust to agent goals and aligned with human expectations. Drawing on both analysis and empirical case studies, we examine how agents need to integrate normative, pragmatic, and situational understanding to select and then to pursue more aligned courses of action in complex, real-world environments.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of e-commerce platforms generates vast amounts of unstructured product data, creating significant challenges for information retrieval, recommendation systems, and data analytics. Knowledge Graphs (KGs) offer a structured, interpretable format to organize such data, yet constructing product-specific KGs remains a complex and manual process. This paper introduces a fully automated, AI agent-driven framework for constructing product knowledge graphs directly from unstructured product descriptions. Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), our method operates in three stages using dedicated agents: ontology creation and expansion, ontology refinement, and knowledge graph population. This agent-based approach ensures semantic coherence, scalability, and high-quality output without relying on predefined schemas or handcrafted extraction rules. We evaluate the system on a real-world dataset of air conditioner product descriptions, demonstrating strong performance in both ontology generation and KG population. The framework achieves over 97\% property coverage and minimal redundancy, validating its effectiveness and practical applicability. Our work highlights the potential of LLMs to automate structured knowledge extraction in retail, providing a scalable path toward intelligent product data integration and utilization.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的不完全方法来打破抽象结构的对称性，通过更好地利用其表示来处理不可区分对象产生的对称性，相比之前的方法速度更快。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在约束编程中，抽象结构（如嵌套集合）需要转换为求解器支持的表示形式。对称性破坏技术能显著加速求解过程，但应用于抽象变量时会产生大量复杂约束，实际性能不佳。

Method: 开发了一种新的不完全对称性破坏方法，通过更好地利用抽象结构的表示来打破对称性，特别针对不可区分对象产生的对称性。

Result: 该方法比(Akgün et al. 2025)中提出的先前方法速度更快。

Conclusion: 新方法通过优化抽象结构的表示利用，有效解决了对称性破坏在抽象变量上的性能问题，为约束编程中的对称性处理提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: In constraint programming and related paradigms, a modeller specifies their problem in a modelling language for a solver to search and return its solution(s). Using high-level modelling languages such as Essence, a modeller may express their problems in terms of abstract structures. These are structures not natively supported by the solvers, and so they have to be transformed into or represented as other structures before solving. For example, nested sets are abstract structures, and they can be represented as matrices in constraint solvers. Many problems contain symmetries and one very common and highly successful technique used in constraint programming is to "break" symmetries, to avoid searching for symmetric solutions. This can speed up the solving process by many orders of magnitude. Most of these symmetry-breaking techniques involve placing some kind of ordering for the variables of the problem, and picking a particular member under the symmetries, usually the smallest. Unfortunately, applying this technique to abstract variables produces a very large number of complex constraints that perform poorly in practice. In this paper, we demonstrate a new incomplete method of breaking the symmetries of abstract structures by better exploiting their representations. We apply the method in breaking the symmetries arising from indistinguishable objects, a commonly occurring type of symmetry, and show that our method is faster than the previous methods proposed in (Akgün et al. 2025).

Method: 提出"Truth Last"角色分配策略和MADC策略，通过路径一致性评估独立角色间的一致性，模拟一致性最高的角色作为真相。

Result: 在9个LLM模型上验证，MADC策略持续表现出先进性能，有效克服MAD的性能瓶颈。

Conclusion: MADC为LLM智能体扩展提供了关键改进路径，能够系统性地优化多智能体辩论的核心机制。

Abstract: Recent studies on LLM agent scaling have highlighted the potential of Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) to enhance reasoning abilities. However, the critical aspect of role allocation strategies remains underexplored. In this study, we demonstrate that allocating roles with differing viewpoints to specific positions significantly impacts MAD's performance in reasoning tasks. Specifically, we find a novel role allocation strategy, "Truth Last", which can improve MAD performance by up to 22% in reasoning tasks. To address the issue of unknown truth in practical applications, we propose the Multi-Agent Debate Consistency (MADC) strategy, which systematically simulates and optimizes its core mechanisms. MADC incorporates path consistency to assess agreement among independent roles, simulating the role with the highest consistency score as the truth. We validated MADC across a range of LLMs (9 models), including the DeepSeek-R1 Distilled Models, on challenging reasoning tasks. MADC consistently demonstrated advanced performance, effectively overcoming MAD's performance bottlenecks and providing a crucial pathway for further improvements in LLM agent scaling.

Conclusion: DSS框架通过结合规划梯度和随机搜索，为自动驾驶规划提供了有效的解决方案，能够生成更安全、更准确的动作序列。

Abstract: Planning allows an agent to safely refine its actions before executing them in the real world. In autonomous driving, this is crucial to avoid collisions and navigate in complex, dense traffic scenarios. One way to plan is to search for the best action sequence. However, this is challenging when all necessary components - policy, next-state predictor, and critic - have to be learned. Here we propose Differentiable Simulation for Search (DSS), a framework that leverages the differentiable simulator Waymax as both a next state predictor and a critic. It relies on the simulator's hardcoded dynamics, making state predictions highly accurate, while utilizing the simulator's differentiability to effectively search across action sequences. Our DSS agent optimizes its actions using gradient descent over imagined future trajectories. We show experimentally that DSS - the combination of planning gradients and stochastic search - significantly improves tracking and path planning accuracy compared to sequence prediction, imitation learning, model-free RL, and other planning methods.

Conclusion: ARCTraj为研究类人推理提供了结构化且可解释的基础，推动了可解释性、对齐性和通用智能的发展。

Abstract: We present ARCTraj, a dataset and methodological framework for modeling human reasoning through complex visual tasks in the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC). While ARC has inspired extensive research on abstract reasoning, most existing approaches rely on static input--output supervision, which limits insight into how reasoning unfolds over time. ARCTraj addresses this gap by recording temporally ordered, object-level actions that capture how humans iteratively transform inputs into outputs, revealing intermediate reasoning steps that conventional datasets overlook. Collected via the O2ARC web interface, it contains around 10,000 trajectories annotated with task identifiers, timestamps, and success labels across 400 training tasks from the ARC-AGI-1 benchmark. It further defines a unified reasoning pipeline encompassing data collection, action abstraction, Markov decision process (MDP) formulation, and downstream learning, enabling integration with reinforcement learning, generative modeling, and sequence modeling methods such as PPO, World Models, GFlowNets, Diffusion agents, and Decision Transformers. Analyses of spatial selection, color attribution, and strategic convergence highlight the structure and diversity of human reasoning. Together, these contributions position ARCTraj as a structured and interpretable foundation for studying human-like reasoning, advancing explainability, alignment, and generalizable intelligence.

Conclusion: 该方法能够学习有效的广义规划和状态空间剪枝公理，为广义规划提供了一种简单而有效的新方法。

Abstract: Generalised planning (GP) refers to the task of synthesising programs that solve families of related planning problems. We introduce a novel, yet simple method for GP: given a set of training problems, for each problem, compute an optimal plan for each goal atom in some order, perform goal regression on the resulting plans, and lift the corresponding outputs to obtain a set of first-order $\textit{Condition} \rightarrow \textit{Actions}$ rules. The rules collectively constitute a generalised plan that can be executed as is or alternatively be used to prune the planning search space. We formalise and prove the conditions under which our method is guaranteed to learn valid generalised plans and state space pruning axioms for search. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art (generalised) planners with respect to the 3 metrics of synthesis cost, planning coverage, and solution quality on various classical and numeric planning domains.

Abstract: The advent of Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) signals a paradigm shift in artificial intelligence, moving from passive perception to active, cross-modal generation. Despite their unprecedented ability to synthesize information, a critical gap persists in evaluation: existing benchmarks primarily assess discriminative understanding or unconstrained image generation separately, failing to measure the integrated cognitive process of generative reasoning. To bridge this gap, we propose that geometric construction provides an ideal testbed as it inherently demands a fusion of language comprehension and precise visual generation. We introduce GGBench, a benchmark designed specifically to evaluate geometric generative reasoning. It provides a comprehensive framework for systematically diagnosing a model's ability to not only understand and reason but to actively construct a solution, thereby setting a more rigorous standard for the next generation of intelligent systems.

Conclusion: MUG为LLMs的多模态推理提供了更可靠有效的框架，代码已开源。

Abstract: Hallucination continues to pose a major obstacle in the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Although the Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) paradigm offers a promising solution by promoting consensus among multiple agents to enhance reliability, it relies on the unrealistic assumption that all debaters are rational and reflective, which is a condition that may not hold when agents themselves are prone to hallucinations. To address this gap, we introduce the Multi-agent Undercover Gaming (MUG) protocol, inspired by social deduction games like "Who is Undercover?". MUG reframes MAD as a process of detecting "undercover" agents (those suffering from hallucinations) by employing multimodal counterfactual tests. Specifically, we modify reference images to introduce counterfactual evidence and observe whether agents can accurately identify these changes, providing ground-truth for identifying hallucinating agents and enabling robust, crowd-powered multimodal reasoning. MUG advances MAD protocols along three key dimensions: (1) enabling factual verification beyond statistical consensus through counterfactual testing; (2) introducing cross-evidence reasoning via dynamically modified evidence sources instead of relying on static inputs; and (3) fostering active reasoning, where agents engage in probing discussions rather than passively answering questions. Collectively, these innovations offer a more reliable and effective framework for multimodal reasoning in LLMs. The source code can be accessed at https://github.com/YongLD/MUG.git.

Conclusion: STaR为LLM表格推理提供了可靠且受认知启发的解决方案，具有实际应用潜力

Abstract: Table reasoning with the large language models (LLMs) is a fundamental path toward building intelligent systems that can understand and analyze over structured data. While recent progress has shown promising results, they still suffer from two key limitations: (i) the reasoning processes lack the depth and iterative refinement characteristic of human cognition; and (ii) the reasoning processes exhibit instability, which compromises their reliability in downstream applications. In this work, we present STaR (slow-thinking for table reasoning), a new framework achieving cognitive table reasoning, in which LLMs are equipped with slow-thinking capabilities by explicitly modeling step-by-step thinking and uncertainty-aware inference. During training, STaR employs two-stage difficulty-aware reinforcement learning (DRL), progressively learning from simple to complex queries under a composite reward. During inference, STaR performs trajectory-level uncertainty quantification by integrating token-level confidence and answer consistency, enabling selection of more credible reasoning paths. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that STaR achieves superior performance and enhanced reasoning stability. Moreover, strong generalization over out-of-domain datasets further demonstrates STaR's potential as a reliable and cognitively inspired solution for table reasoning with LLMs.

Abstract: Autonomous aerial systems increasingly rely on large language models (LLMs) for mission planning, perception, and decision-making, yet the lack of standardized and physically grounded benchmarks limits systematic evaluation of their reasoning capabilities. To address this gap, we introduce UAVBench, an open benchmark dataset comprising 50,000 validated UAV flight scenarios generated through taxonomy-guided LLM prompting and multi-stage safety validation. Each scenario is encoded in a structured JSON schema that includes mission objectives, vehicle configuration, environmental conditions, and quantitative risk labels, providing a unified representation of UAV operations across diverse domains. Building on this foundation, we present UAVBench_MCQ, a reasoning-oriented extension containing 50,000 multiple-choice questions spanning ten cognitive and ethical reasoning styles, ranging from aerodynamics and navigation to multi-agent coordination and integrated reasoning. This framework enables interpretable and machine-checkable assessment of UAV-specific cognition under realistic operational contexts. We evaluate 32 state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-5, ChatGPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Flash, DeepSeek V3, Qwen3 235B, and ERNIE 4.5 300B, and find strong performance in perception and policy reasoning but persistent challenges in ethics-aware and resource-constrained decision-making. UAVBench establishes a reproducible and physically grounded foundation for benchmarking agentic AI in autonomous aerial systems and advancing next-generation UAV reasoning intelligence.

Abstract: The discovery of novel Ionic Liquids (ILs) is hindered by critical challenges in property prediction, including limited data, poor model accuracy, and fragmented workflows. Leveraging the power of Large Language Models (LLMs), we introduce AIonopedia, to the best of our knowledge, the first LLM agent for IL discovery. Powered by an LLM-augmented multimodal domain foundation model for ILs, AIonopedia enables accurate property predictions and incorporates a hierarchical search architecture for molecular screening and design. Trained and evaluated on a newly curated and comprehensive IL dataset, our model delivers superior performance. Complementing these results, evaluations on literature-reported systems indicate that the agent can perform effective IL modification. Moving beyond offline tests, the practical efficacy was further confirmed through real-world wet-lab validation, in which the agent demonstrated exceptional generalization capabilities on challenging out-of-distribution tasks, underscoring its ability to accelerate real-world IL discovery.

*Julius Wenzel,Syeda Umaima Alam,Andreas Schmidt,Hanwei Zhang,Holger Hermanns*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种通过强制记录AI系统训练和推理中每个组件的方法，来解决AI决策可追溯性问题，并展示了首个支持生成防篡改、可验证且详尽AI决策痕迹的运行工作流。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI系统在关键决策中应用增加，存在决策可能损害人们福祉或侵犯基本人权的风险。当前AI系统缺乏适当的决策过程文档，阻碍了追溯决策来源的能力，这在确定AI决策是否违法时至关重要。

Method: 扩展DBOM概念，利用机密计算技术构建有效运行的工作流，强制记录训练和推理过程中的每个组件，生成防篡改、可验证且详尽的AI决策痕迹。

Conclusion: 该方法为解决AI决策可追溯性问题提供了一种激进但实用的方法，支持生成在法庭上站得住脚的AI决策文档，为重建责任链奠定了基础。

Abstract: An ever increasing number of high-stake decisions are made or assisted by automated systems employing brittle artificial intelligence technology. There is a substantial risk that some of these decision induce harm to people, by infringing their well-being or their fundamental human rights. The state-of-the-art in AI systems makes little effort with respect to appropriate documentation of the decision process. This obstructs the ability to trace what went into a decision, which in turn is a prerequisite to any attempt of reconstructing a responsibility chain. Specifically, such traceability is linked to a documentation that will stand up in court when determining the cause of some AI-based decision that inadvertently or intentionally violates the law.
  This paper takes a radical, yet practical, approach to this problem, by enforcing the documentation of each and every component that goes into the training or inference of an automated decision. As such, it presents the first running workflow supporting the generation of tamper-proof, verifiable and exhaustive traces of AI decisions. In doing so, we expand the DBOM concept into an effective running workflow leveraging confidential computing technology. We demonstrate the inner workings of the workflow in the development of an app to tell poisonous and edible mushrooms apart, meant as a playful example of high-stake decision support.

*Patrick Koopmann,Yasir Mahmood,Axel-Cyrille Ngonga Ngomo,Balram Tiwari*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出对比ABox解释的概念，用于回答"为什么a是C的实例而b不是？"这类问题。相比单独解释正蕴含或缺失蕴含，对比解释同时考虑两者，聚焦于a和b之间的相关共性和差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法只能单独解释正蕴含（为什么知识库蕴含C(a)）或缺失蕴含（为什么不蕴含C(b)），缺乏同时考虑两者的对比解释方法，无法有效回答关于两个个体差异的对比性问题。

Method: 为描述逻辑本体论中的ABox推理开发了对比解释的适当概念，分析了不同变体在不同最优性标准下的计算复杂性，考虑了轻量级和更表达性的描述逻辑。实现了一个计算对比解释变体的方法，并在现实知识库的生成问题上进行了评估。

Result: 开发了对比ABox解释的形式化概念，分析了不同描述逻辑变体的计算复杂性，实现了计算算法并在现实知识库上进行了评估。

Conclusion: 对比ABox解释提供了一种同时考虑正蕴含和缺失蕴含的解释方法，能够有效回答关于个体差异的对比性问题，为知识库推理提供了更全面的解释能力。

Abstract: We introduce the notion of contrastive ABox explanations to answer questions of the type "Why is a an instance of C, but b is not?". While there are various approaches for explaining positive entailments (why is C(a) entailed by the knowledge base) as well as missing entailments (why is C(b) not entailed) in isolation, contrastive explanations consider both at the same time, which allows them to focus on the relevant commonalities and differences between a and b. We develop an appropriate notion of contrastive explanations for the special case of ABox reasoning with description logic ontologies, and analyze the computational complexity for different variants under different optimality criteria, considering lightweight as well as more expressive description logics. We implemented a first method for computing one variant of contrastive explanations, and evaluated it on generated problems for realistic knowledge bases.

*Ruoxi Cheng,Haoxuan Ma,Teng Ma,Hongyi Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EcoAlign是一个推理时框架，将大型视觉语言模型对齐重新定义为经济理性的搜索问题，通过前瞻性函数动态权衡安全性、实用性和计算成本，在降低计算成本的同时达到或超越现有方法的安全性和实用性表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的对齐方法在安全性、实用性和运营成本之间存在权衡困难，且仅关注最终输出的过程盲性会浪费大量计算预算在不安全的推理上，使得有害推理能够通过良性理由伪装来绕过简单的安全评分。

Method: 将LVLM视为有限理性智能体，逐步扩展思维图，使用前瞻性函数（类似于净现值）对行动进行评分，动态权衡预期安全性、实用性和成本与剩余预算的关系，并通过最弱环节原则强制执行路径安全性。

Result: 在3个闭源和2个开源模型上的6个数据集上的广泛实验表明，EcoAlign在较低计算成本下达到或超越了最先进的安全性和实用性。

Conclusion: EcoAlign为强大的LVLM对齐提供了一个原则性、经济性的路径，解决了安全性和计算效率之间的平衡问题。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) exhibit powerful reasoning capabilities but suffer sophisticated jailbreak vulnerabilities. Fundamentally, aligning LVLMs is not just a safety challenge but a problem of economic efficiency. Current alignment methods struggle with the trade-off between safety, utility, and operational costs. Critically, a focus solely on final outputs (process-blindness) wastes significant computational budget on unsafe deliberation. This flaw allows harmful reasoning to be disguised with benign justifications, thereby circumventing simple additive safety scores. To address this, we propose EcoAlign, an inference-time framework that reframes alignment as an economically rational search by treating the LVLM as a boundedly rational agent. EcoAlign incrementally expands a thought graph and scores actions using a forward-looking function (analogous to net present value) that dynamically weighs expected safety, utility, and cost against the remaining budget. To prevent deception, path safety is enforced via the weakest-link principle. Extensive experiments across 3 closed-source and 2 open-source models on 6 datasets show that EcoAlign matches or surpasses state-of-the-art safety and utility at a lower computational cost, thereby offering a principled, economical pathway to robust LVLM alignment.

TL;DR: RLSLM是一种混合强化学习框架，将基于规则的社会运动模型集成到强化学习的奖励函数中，用于实现社会感知的导航策略，在保持可解释性的同时提高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在人群环境中导航时避免引起不适的问题，结合基于规则方法的可解释性和数据驱动方法的灵活性，弥补两者各自的不足。

Method: 提出RLSLM框架，将基于实证行为实验的社会运动模型集成到强化学习奖励函数中，生成方向敏感的社会舒适度场，联合优化机械能和社会舒适度。

Result: 通过沉浸式VR实验证明，RLSLM在用户体验方面优于最先进的基于规则模型，消融和敏感性分析显示其比传统数据驱动方法具有显著改进的可解释性。

Conclusion: 这项工作提出了一种可扩展的、以人为中心的方法论，有效整合认知科学和机器学习，用于现实世界的社会导航应用。

Abstract: Navigating human-populated environments without causing discomfort is a critical capability for socially-aware agents. While rule-based approaches offer interpretability through predefined psychological principles, they often lack generalizability and flexibility. Conversely, data-driven methods can learn complex behaviors from large-scale datasets, but are typically inefficient, opaque, and difficult to align with human intuitions. To bridge this gap, we propose RLSLM, a hybrid Reinforcement Learning framework that integrates a rule-based Social Locomotion Model, grounded in empirical behavioral experiments, into the reward function of a reinforcement learning framework. The social locomotion model generates an orientation-sensitive social comfort field that quantifies human comfort across space, enabling socially aligned navigation policies with minimal training. RLSLM then jointly optimizes mechanical energy and social comfort, allowing agents to avoid intrusions into personal or group space. A human-agent interaction experiment using an immersive VR-based setup demonstrates that RLSLM outperforms state-of-the-art rule-based models in user experience. Ablation and sensitivity analyses further show the model's significantly improved interpretability over conventional data-driven methods. This work presents a scalable, human-centered methodology that effectively integrates cognitive science and machine learning for real-world social navigation.

Result: 能够生成具有已知因果动态的合成多元时间序列，支持模拟和因果干预，包括用户指定的分布偏移。

Conclusion: KarmaTS通过专家知情的模拟，为因果发现算法提供了灵活的验证和基准测试能力。

Abstract: We introduce KarmaTS, an interactive framework for constructing lag-indexed, executable spatiotemporal causal graphical models for multivariate time series (MTS) simulation. Motivated by the challenge of access-restricted physiological data, KarmaTS generates synthetic MTS with known causal dynamics and augments real-world datasets with expert knowledge. The system constructs a discrete-time structural causal process (DSCP) by combining expert knowledge and algorithmic proposals in a mixed-initiative, human-in-the-loop workflow. The resulting DSCP supports simulation and causal interventions, including those under user-specified distribution shifts. KarmaTS handles mixed variable types, contemporaneous and lagged edges, and modular edge functionals ranging from parameterizable templates to neural network models. Together, these features enable flexible validation and benchmarking of causal discovery algorithms through expert-informed simulation.

TL;DR: MarsRL是一个新颖的强化学习框架，通过代理管道并行性联合优化多代理推理系统中的所有代理，显著提升了开源模型在复杂推理任务上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在单次推理过程中的输出长度限制了推理深度，而现有的多代理推理系统在开源模型上表现不佳，主要由于批评和修正能力不足。

Method: 提出MarsRL框架，采用代理特定的奖励机制来减轻奖励噪声，并使用管道启发的训练方法来提高处理长轨迹的效率，联合优化系统中的所有代理。

Result: 在Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507上应用MarsRL，将AIME2025准确率从86.5%提升至93.3%，BeyondAIME从64.9%提升至73.8%，甚至超越了Qwen3-235B-A22B-Thinking-2507。

Conclusion: MarsRL展示了在多代理推理系统中推进强化学习的潜力，能够扩展其在不同推理任务中的适用性。

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has been propelled by reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) and test-time scaling. However, the limited output length of LLMs constrains the depth of reasoning attainable in a single inference process. Multi-agent reasoning systems offer a promising alternative by employing multiple agents including Solver, Verifier, and Corrector, to iteratively refine solutions. While effective in closed-source models like Gemini 2.5 Pro, they struggle to generalize to open-source models due to insufficient critic and correction capabilities. To address this, we propose MarsRL, a novel reinforcement learning framework with agentic pipeline parallelism, designed to jointly optimize all agents in the system. MarsRL introduces agent-specific reward mechanisms to mitigate reward noise and employs pipeline-inspired training to enhance efficiency in handling long trajectories. Applied to Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507, MarsRL improves AIME2025 accuracy from 86.5% to 93.3% and BeyondAIME from 64.9% to 73.8%, even surpassing Qwen3-235B-A22B-Thinking-2507. These findings highlight the potential of MarsRL to advance multi-agent reasoning systems and broaden their applicability across diverse reasoning tasks.

Motivation: 现有MARL方法大多假设通信是瞬时、可靠且带宽无限的，但这些条件在现实部署中很少满足，需要研究在现实约束下的鲁棒通信策略。

Method: 采用系统性综述方法，分析MARL在通信约束下的最新进展，重点关注消息扰动、传输延迟和带宽限制等现实问题。

Result: 识别了低延迟可靠性、带宽密集型数据共享和通信隐私权衡等核心挑战，并在三个实际应用中进行了深入分析。

Conclusion: 提出了统一方法，将通信、学习和鲁棒性协同设计，以弥合理论MARL模型与实际实现之间的差距，并指出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has made significant strides in enabling coordinated behaviors among autonomous agents. However, most existing approaches assume that communication is instantaneous, reliable, and has unlimited bandwidth; these conditions are rarely met in real-world deployments. This survey systematically reviews recent advances in robust and efficient communication strategies for MARL under realistic constraints, including message perturbations, transmission delays, and limited bandwidth. Furthermore, because the challenges of low-latency reliability, bandwidth-intensive data sharing, and communication-privacy trade-offs are central to practical MARL systems, we focus on three applications involving cooperative autonomous driving, distributed simultaneous localization and mapping, and federated learning. Finally, we identify key open challenges and future research directions, advocating a unified approach that co-designs communication, learning, and robustness to bridge the gap between theoretical MARL models and practical implementations.

TL;DR: CURENet是一个多模态模型，通过整合非结构化临床笔记、实验室测试和患者时间序列数据，利用LLM处理临床文本和文本实验室测试，以及transformer编码器处理纵向序列就诊数据，实现了对慢性疾病的高精度预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的预测模型未能充分利用EHR中多模态数据之间的交互、冗余和时间模式，通常只关注单一数据类型或忽略这些复杂性，而医生需要综合这些多模态和时间数据源来形成对患者健康的全面视图。

Method: 使用大型语言模型处理临床文本和文本实验室测试，使用transformer编码器处理纵向序列就诊数据，整合非结构化临床笔记、实验室测试和患者时间序列数据。

Result: 在MIMIC-III和FEMH数据集上，CURENet在多标签框架下预测前10种慢性疾病的准确率超过94%。

Conclusion: 多模态EHR整合有潜力增强临床决策制定并改善患者预后。

Abstract: Electronic health records (EHRs) are designed to synthesize diverse data types, including unstructured clinical notes, structured lab tests, and time-series visit data. Physicians draw on these multimodal and temporal sources of EHR data to form a comprehensive view of a patient's health, which is crucial for informed therapeutic decision-making. Yet, most predictive models fail to fully capture the interactions, redundancies, and temporal patterns across multiple data modalities, often focusing on a single data type or overlooking these complexities. In this paper, we present CURENet, a multimodal model (Combining Unified Representations for Efficient chronic disease prediction) that integrates unstructured clinical notes, lab tests, and patients' time-series data by utilizing large language models (LLMs) for clinical text processing and textual lab tests, as well as transformer encoders for longitudinal sequential visits. CURENet has been capable of capturing the intricate interaction between different forms of clinical data and creating a more reliable predictive model for chronic illnesses. We evaluated CURENet using the public MIMIC-III and private FEMH datasets, where it achieved over 94\% accuracy in predicting the top 10 chronic conditions in a multi-label framework. Our findings highlight the potential of multimodal EHR integration to enhance clinical decision-making and improve patient outcomes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI系统在训练后难以自适应调整问题解决策略，要么只能修改文本输入，要么需要离线优化且部署后无法改变。需要一种能在推理时灵活调整所有策略组件的系统。

Method: 使用基于LLM的元策略，通过Guide组件生成候选策略，Consolidator组件整合执行反馈来改进策略生成，动态创建完整的计算程序。

Result: 在五个挑战性基准测试中，EGuR比最强基线准确率提升高达14%，计算成本降低高达111倍，且随着经验积累性能持续提升。

Conclusion: EGuR证明了基于经验的动态策略生成能够显著提升AI系统的自适应能力和效率，为构建更智能的代理系统提供了新方向。

Abstract: Enabling agentic AI systems to adapt their problem-solving approaches based on post-training interactions remains a fundamental challenge. While systems that update and maintain a memory at inference time have been proposed, existing designs only steer the system by modifying textual input to a language model or agent, which means that they cannot change sampling parameters, remove tools, modify system prompts, or switch between agentic and workflow paradigms. On the other hand, systems that adapt more flexibly require offline optimization and remain static once deployed. We present Experience-Guided Reasoner (EGuR), which generates tailored strategies -- complete computational procedures involving LLM calls, tools, sampling parameters, and control logic -- dynamically at inference time based on accumulated experience. We achieve this using an LLM-based meta-strategy -- a strategy that outputs strategies -- enabling adaptation of all strategy components (prompts, sampling parameters, tool configurations, and control logic). EGuR operates through two components: a Guide generates multiple candidate strategies conditioned on the current problem and structured memory of past experiences, while a Consolidator integrates execution feedback to improve future strategy generation. This produces complete, ready-to-run strategies optimized for each problem, which can be cached, retrieved, and executed as needed without wasting resources. Across five challenging benchmarks (AIME 2025, 3-SAT, and three Big Bench Extra Hard tasks), EGuR achieves up to 14% accuracy improvements over the strongest baselines while reducing computational costs by up to 111x, with both metrics improving as the system gains experience.

Conclusion: 测试时策略调整为解决AI代理伦理对齐问题提供了有效且可扩展的解决方案，能够在无需重新训练的情况下实现精确的行为控制。

Abstract: The deployment of decision-making AI agents presents a critical challenge in maintaining alignment with human values or guidelines while operating in complex, dynamic environments. Agents trained solely to achieve their objectives may adopt harmful behavior, exposing a key trade-off between maximizing the reward function and maintaining the alignment. For the pre-trained agents, ensuring alignment is particularly challenging, as retraining can be a costly and slow process. This is further complicated by the diverse and potentially conflicting attributes representing the ethical values for alignment. To address these challenges, we propose a test-time alignment technique based on model-guided policy shaping. Our method allows precise control over individual behavioral attributes, generalizes across diverse reinforcement learning (RL) environments, and facilitates a principled trade-off between ethical alignment and reward maximization without requiring agent retraining. We evaluate our approach using the MACHIAVELLI benchmark, which comprises 134 text-based game environments and thousands of annotated scenarios involving ethical decisions. The RL agents are first trained to maximize the reward in their respective games. At test time, we apply policy shaping via scenario-action attribute classifiers to ensure decision alignment with ethical attributes. We compare our approach against prior training-time methods and general-purpose agents, as well as study several types of ethical violations and power-seeking behavior. Our results demonstrate that test-time policy shaping provides an effective and scalable solution for mitigating unethical behavior across diverse environments and alignment attributes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理空间和网络数据时，交叉拟合会导致训练样本过小的问题，因此需要建立无需交叉拟合的DML方法有效性。

Method: 将i.i.d.数据的稳定性条件扩展到依赖数据，提出"邻域稳定性"概念，要求机器学习器对缓慢增长的邻域内观测值的重采样不敏感。

Result: 证明了现有各种机器学习器的稳定性结果可以适应验证邻域稳定性，从而支持在依赖数据上使用无需交叉拟合的DML方法。

Conclusion: 通过加强稳定性条件，可以在弱依赖数据上建立有效的双重/去偏机器学习方法，无需依赖交叉拟合。

Abstract: This paper studies double/debiased machine learning (DML) methods applied to weakly dependent data. We allow observations to be situated in a general metric space that accommodates spatial and network data. Existing work implements cross-fitting by excluding from the training fold observations sufficiently close to the evaluation fold. We find in simulations that this can result in exceedingly small training fold sizes, particularly with network data. We therefore seek to establish the validity of DML without cross-fitting, building on recent work by Chen et al. (2022). They study i.i.d. data and require the machine learner to satisfy a natural stability condition requiring insensitivity to data perturbations that resample a single observation. We extend these results to dependent data by strengthening stability to "neighborhood stability," which requires insensitivity to resampling observations in any slowly growing neighborhood. We show that existing results on the stability of various machine learners can be adapted to verify neighborhood stability.

Motivation: 研究非对称离散Colonel Blotto游戏的均衡策略，特别是当玩家资源不对称时如何确定最优策略和博弈值，扩展了现有General Lotto游戏的可解范围。

Method: 使用离散General Lotto游戏方法推导均衡策略，并提出约束离散General Lotto游戏变体来处理超出传统方法可解的情况。

Result: 在B≥2(⌈A/K⌉-1)和B≤⌊A/K⌋两种情况下成功推导出均衡策略和博弈值公式，解决了超出General Lotto可解范围的案例。

Conclusion: 通过提出的约束离散General Lotto游戏，成功扩展了离散Colonel Blotto游戏的可解范围，为不对称资源分配博弈提供了新的分析方法。

Abstract: We study equilibrium strategies and the value of the asymmetric variant of the discrete Colonel Blotto game with $K \geq 2$ battlefields, $B \geq 1$ resources of the weaker player and $A > B$ resources of the stronger player. We derive equilibrium strategies and the formulas for the value of the game for the cases where the number of resources of the weaker player, $B$, is at least $2(\lceil A/K \rceil - 1)$ as well as for the cases where this number is at most $\lfloor A/K \rfloor$. In particular, we solve all the cases of the game which can be solved using the discrete General Lotto game of~\cite{Hart08}. We propose a constrained variant of the discrete General Lotto game and use it to derive equilibrium strategies in the discrete Colonel Blotto game, that go beyond the General Lotto solvable cases game.

Main category: econ.TH

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一个行为经济学模型来分析场外生鲜产品市场的自组织动态，揭示了即使基于简单即时规则，卖家竞争也能自我调节价格和客户量，并产生振荡行为防止市场垄断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于有限理性、信息受限和短期优化的证据，场外生鲜产品市场是发展微观经济系统行为分析方法的理想实例，旨在通过严谨数学分析刻画此类市场自发组织和运作的主要特征。

Method: 引入并研究了一个风格化的动态模型，描述买方群体和每个批发商价格/吸引力的时间演化。动态由参与者对基本指标变化的即时反应驱动，买方受忠诚度影响但也寻求更好报价，卖方主要追求利润最大化但也会在客户不足时提升竞争力。

Result: 结果显示，尽管由简单即时规则控制，卖家竞争随时间自我调节，将价格和客户量分散限制在有限范围内，产生振荡行为防止任何卖家永久主导市场。在2个卖家竞争的最简单情况下，分析证明当买方忠诚度足够高或卖方反应性足够低时，系统会收敛到均衡。

Conclusion: 该研究识别并证明了系统长期稳定和振荡渐近阻尼的特征，揭示了市场自我调节机制如何确保竞争动态的稳定性。

Abstract: Given the combined evidences of bounded rationality, limited information and short-term optimization, over-the-counter (OTC) fresh product markets provide a perfect instance where to develop a behavioural approach to the analysis of micro-economic systems. Aiming at characterizing via a rigorous mathematical analysis, the main features of the spontaneous organization and functioning of such markets, we introduce and we study a stylized dynamical model for the time evolution of buyers populations and prices/attractiveness at each wholesaler. The dynamics is governed by immediate reactions of the actors to changes in basic indicators. Buyers are influenced by some degree of loyalty to their regular suppliers. Yet, at times, they also prospect for potential better offers. On the other hand, sellers primarily aim at maximising their profit. Yet, they can be also prone to improving their competitiveness in case of clientele deficit.
  Our results reveal that, in spite of being governed by simple and immediate rules, the competition between sellers self-regulates in time, as it constrains to bounded ranges the dispersion of both prices and clientele volumes, does similarly for the mean clientele volume, and it generates oscillatory behaviours that prevent any seller to dominate permanently its competitors (and to be dominated forever). Long-term behaviours are also investigated, with focus on asymptotic convergence to an equilibrium, as can be expected for a standard functioning mode. In particular, in the simplest case of 2 competing sellers, a normal-form-like analysis proves that such convergence holds, provided that the buyer's loyalty is sufficiently high or the sellers' reactivity is sufficiently low. In other words, this result identifies and proves those characteristics of the system that are responsible for long term stability and asymptotic damping of the oscillations.

Main category: econ.TH

TL;DR: 研究在代理人间存在朋友/敌人/中立关系的网络中，如何设计占优策略激励相容机制来选择代理人的问题。当计划者知道双边关系时存在有效机制，不知道时不存在，并在结构平衡网络中获得了精确特征化结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计划者需要从多个代理人中选择一个，但无法直接观察到代理人的二元特征。代理人之间存在复杂的社会关系（朋友/敌人/中立），这些关系影响代理人的偏好和选择结果。

Method: 分析不同信息结构下的机制设计：当计划者知道双边关系时推导有效DSIC机制的充分条件；当不知道关系时证明不存在有效机制，并比较两种"次优"DSIC机制的相对效率；在结构平衡网络中建立精确特征化结果。

Result: 当计划者知道代理人间的双边关系时，存在有效的占优策略激励相容机制；当不知道这些关系时，不存在同时满足效率和DSIC的机制；在结构平衡网络中获得了机制设计的精确特征化。

Conclusion: 计划者对代理人社会关系的信息获取程度直接影响机制设计的可行性，在结构平衡网络中可以获得最优机制设计结果，为复杂社会网络中的代理人选择问题提供了理论指导。

Abstract: A planner wants to select one agent out of n agents on the basis of a binary characteristic that is commonly known to all agents but is not observed by the planner. Any pair of agents can either be friends or enemies or impartials of each other. An individual's most preferred outcome is that she be selected. If she is not selected, then she would prefer that a friend be selected, and if neither she herself or a friend is selected, then she would prefer that an impartial agent be selected. Finally, her least preferred outcome is that an enemy be selected. The planner wants to design a dominant strategy incentive compatible mechanism in order to be able choose a desirable agent. We derive sufficient conditions for existence of efficient and DSIC mechanisms when the planner knows the bilateral relationships between agents. We also show that if the planner does not know these relationships, then there is no efficient and DSIC mechanism and we compare the relative efficiency of two ``second-best'' DSIC mechanisms. Finally, we obtain sharp characterization results when the network of friends and enemies satisfies structural balance.

*Minoru Kitahara,Hiroshi Uno*

Main category: econ.TH

TL;DR: 本文研究了在完全交换要求下的一对一匹配问题，提出了两种基于分配分区的新机制：链式序列独裁和两阶段序列独裁，这些机制同时满足策略证明性、尊重改进和分区内效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在完全交换约束下的匹配机制设计，其中每个代理必须分配到与其初始禀赋不同的对象，旨在开发既满足效率又保持激励兼容性的机制。

Method: 提出了分配分区的概念，并在此基础上设计了两种新机制：链式序列独裁（C-SD）和两阶段序列独裁（T-SD）。C-SD通过绑定选择链运作，T-SD通过提名-分配两阶段程序运作。

Result: C-SD和T-SD机制在给定分配分区下同时满足策略证明性、尊重改进和分区内效率。修改的TTC机制（CE-TTC）在CE约束下实现效率但无法满足尊重改进。对于三到四个代理，没有机制能同时实现CE约束下的效率、尊重改进和策略证明性。

Conclusion: 基于分配分区的设计在硬性完全交换要求下为具有投资激励的真实实施提供了价值，展示了在复杂约束条件下机制设计的权衡。

Abstract: This paper studies one-sided matching under a complete exchange (CE) requirement, where each agent must be assigned an object different from its initial endowment. We introduce assignment partition -- a partition of agents and choice sets that builds CE into feasibility -- and, within this structure, propose two new mechanisms.
  Chain Serial Dictatorship (C-SD) operates within the partition as a binding-choice chain: the highest-priority agent picks from its allowed set and the right to pick passes to the owner of the chosen object; if that owner has already picked, the right reverts to the highest-priority remaining agent. Two-Stage Serial Dictatorship (T-SD) operates within the partition as a nominate-then-assign procedure: in Stage 1, agents tentatively nominate objects in exogenous priority, and the owners of nominated objects determine an endogenous final priority; in Stage 2, serial dictatorship runs within the partition using that final priority. For any given assignment partition, C-SD and T-SD simultaneously satisfy strategy-proofness, respecting improvement, and efficiency relative to the partition.
  We then examine the limits of pursuing market-wide efficiency under the CE constraint. As a benchmark, we study a modified TTC, CE-TTC, which first enforces a CE-compliant reassignment and then runs a self-avoiding top-trading-cycles phase; CE-TTC achieves efficiency within the CE constraint and strategy-proofness but fails respecting improvement. Moreover, for three and four agents, no mechanism can simultaneously achieve efficiency within the CE constraint, respecting improvement, and strategy-proofness. These findings underscore the value of partition-based design for truthful implementation with investment incentives under a hard CE mandate.

TL;DR: 本文开发了理性预期模型来研究范围信息（关于风险资产未来收益上下限的信息）披露对市场的影响。研究发现范围信息披露能降低市场价格对私有信号的敏感性，提高市场流动性，其影响取决于披露范围的位置和精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融市场中向投资者发布的信息形式多样，范围信息（关于资产未来收益上下限的信息）是其中一种重要形式。本研究旨在探索范围信息披露对市场的具体影响。

Method: 开发理性预期模型来分析范围信息披露的市场影响，考虑披露范围的位置和精度等因素。

Result: 范围信息披露能降低市场价格对私有信号的敏感性，增加市场流动性。当私有信号和噪声交易量的线性组合远离披露范围时，价格对私有信号变化的反应几乎消失，而披露范围的变动能有效影响价格。如果披露范围中点高于（低于）特定标准，披露会降低（提高）资产溢价。

Conclusion: 范围信息披露对市场具有显著影响，其效果取决于披露范围的具体特征，包括位置和精度，这对金融市场监管和信息披露政策具有重要启示。

Abstract: The information released to investors in financial markets has various forms. We refer to range information as information about the upper and lower bound which the payoff of a risky asset may reach in the future. This study develops rational expectation models to explore the market impacts of disclosure of range information. Our model shows that its disclosure can decrease the sensitivity of market price to private signal and increase market liquidity. The market impact of its disclosure depends on the position and precision of the disclosed range. When the linear combination of private signal and noise trading volume is distant from the disclosed range, the reaction of price to a variation in private signal will almost vanish, whereas a movement of the disclosed range can affect the price efficiently. If the midpoint of the disclosed range is higher (lower) than a criterion which is specified in this study, the disclosure will reduce (raise) asset premium.

TL;DR: 提出Attentive Feature Aggregation (AFA)方法，通过可训练的注意力机制聚合预训练视觉表示中的任务相关特征，提升视觉运动策略在扰动场景中的鲁棒性，无需昂贵的数据增强或PVR微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练视觉表示(PVRs)可能编码大量任务无关的场景信息，导致训练出的视觉运动策略在面对域外视觉变化和干扰物时缺乏鲁棒性。

Method: 提出AFA（Attentive Feature Aggregation），一种轻量级的可训练池化机制，能够学习自然地关注任务相关的视觉线索，忽略语义丰富的场景干扰物。

Result: 在仿真和真实世界的广泛实验中，使用AFA训练的策略在存在视觉扰动的情况下显著优于标准池化方法。

Conclusion: 忽略无关视觉信息是部署鲁棒且可泛化的视觉运动策略的关键步骤。

Abstract: The adoption of pre-trained visual representations (PVRs), leveraging features from large-scale vision models, has become a popular paradigm for training visuomotor policies. However, these powerful representations can encode a broad range of task-irrelevant scene information, making the resulting trained policies vulnerable to out-of-domain visual changes and distractors. In this work we address visuomotor policy feature pooling as a solution to the observed lack of robustness in perturbed scenes. We achieve this via Attentive Feature Aggregation (AFA), a lightweight, trainable pooling mechanism that learns to naturally attend to task-relevant visual cues, ignoring even semantically rich scene distractors. Through extensive experiments in both simulation and the real world, we demonstrate that policies trained with AFA significantly outperform standard pooling approaches in the presence of visual perturbations, without requiring expensive dataset augmentation or fine-tuning of the PVR. Our findings show that ignoring extraneous visual information is a crucial step towards deploying robust and generalisable visuomotor policies. Project Page: tsagkas.github.io/afa

Abstract: As social robots increasingly enter public environments, their acceptance depends not only on technical reliability but also on ethical integrity, accessibility, and user trust. This paper reports on a pilot deployment of an ARI social robot functioning as a university receptionist, designed in alignment with the SecuRoPS framework for secure and ethical social robot deployment. Thirty-five students and staff interacted with the robot and provided structured feedback on safety, privacy, usability, accessibility, and transparency. The results show generally positive perceptions of physical safety, data protection, and ethical behavior, while also highlighting challenges related to accessibility, inclusiveness, and dynamic interaction. Beyond the empirical findings, the study demonstrates how theoretical frameworks for ethical and secure design can be implemented in real-world contexts through end-user evaluation. It also provides a public GitHub repository containing reusable templates for ARI robot applications to support reproducibility and lower the entry barrier for new researchers. By combining user perspectives with practical technical resources, this work contributes to ongoing discussions in AI and society and supports the development of trustworthy, inclusive, and ethically responsible social robots for public spaces.

Abstract: Searches are conducted to find missing persons and/or objects given uncertain information, imperfect observers and large search areas in Search and Rescue (SAR). In many scenarios, such as Maritime SAR, expected survival times are short and optimal search could increase the likelihood of success. This optimization problem is complex for nontrivial problems given its probabilistic nature.
  Stochastic optimization methods search large problems by nondeterministically sampling the space to reduce the effective size of the problem. This has been used in SAR planning to search otherwise intractably large problems but the stochastic nature provides no formal guarantees on the quality of solutions found in finite time.
  This paper instead presents $\rm{A}^{\rm{SAR}}$, an $\varepsilon$-optimal search algorithm for SAR planning. It calculates a heuristic to bound the search space and uses graph-search methods to find solutions that are formally guaranteed to be within a user-specified factor, $\varepsilon$, of the optimal solution. It finds better solutions faster than existing optimization approaches in operational simulations. It is also demonstrated with a real-world field trial on Lake Ontario, Canada, where it was used to locate a drifting manikin in only 150s.

Abstract: Search and rescue (SAR) robots are required to quickly traverse terrain and perform high-force rescue tasks, necessitating both terrain adaptability and controlled high-force output. Few platforms exist today for SAR, and fewer still have the ability to cover both tasks of terrain adaptability and high-force output when performing extraction. While legged robots offer significant ability to traverse uneven terrain, they typically are unable to incorporate mechanisms that provide variable high-force outputs, unlike traditional wheel-based drive trains. This work introduces a novel concept for a dynamically extensible and retractable robot leg. Leveraging a dynamically extensible and retractable five-bar linkage design, it allows for mechanically switching between height-advantaged and force-advantaged configurations via a geometric transformation. A testbed evaluated leg performance across linkage geometries and operating modes, with empirical and analytical analyses conducted on stride length, force output, and stability. The results demonstrate that the morphing leg offers a promising path toward SAR robots that can both navigate terrain quickly and perform rescue tasks effectively.

Abstract: Hard-constraint trajectory planners often rely on commercial solvers and demand substantial computational resources. Existing soft-constraint methods achieve faster computation, but either (1) decouple spatial and temporal optimization or (2) restrict the search space. To overcome these limitations, we introduce MIGHTY, a Hermite spline-based planner that performs spatiotemporal optimization while fully leveraging the continuous search space of a spline.

In hardware, MIGHTY completes multiple high-speed flights up to 6.7 m/s in a cluttered static environment and long-duration flights with dynamically added obstacles.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel decentralized approach for achieving emergent behavior in multi-agent systems with minimal information sharing. Based on prior work in simple orbits, our method produces a broad class of stable, periodic trajectories by stabilizing the system around a Lie group-based geometric embedding. Employing the Lie group SO(3), we generate a wider range of periodic curves than existing quaternion-based methods. Furthermore, we exploit SO(3) properties to eliminate the need for velocity inputs, allowing agents to receive only position inputs. We also propose a novel phase controller that ensures uniform agent separation, along with a formal stability proof. Validation through simulations and experiments showcases the method's adaptability to complex low-level dynamics and disturbances.

Abstract: Quantifying greenhouse-gases (GHG) in wetlands is critical for climate modeling and restoration assessment, yet manual sampling is labor-intensive, and time demanding. We present WetExplorer, an autonomous tracked robot that automates the full GHG-sampling workflow. The robot system integrates low-ground-pressure locomotion, centimeter-accurate lift placement, dual-RTK sensor fusion, obstacle avoidance planning, and deep-learning perception in a containerized ROS2 stack. Outdoor trials verified that the sensor-fusion stack maintains a mean localization error of 1.71 cm, the vision module estimates object pose with 7 mm translational and 3° rotational accuracy, while indoor trials demonstrated that the full motion-planning pipeline positions the sampling chamber within a global tolerance of 70 mm while avoiding obstacles, all without human intervention. By eliminating the manual bottleneck, WetExplorer enables high-frequency, multi-site GHG measurements and opens the door for dense, long-duration datasets in saturated wetland terrain.

Abstract: Coordinating a team of robots to reposition multiple objects in cluttered environments requires reasoning jointly about where robots should establish contact, how to manipulate objects once contact is made, and how to navigate safely and efficiently at scale. Prior approaches typically fall into two extremes -- either learning the entire task or relying on privileged information and hand-designed planners -- both of which struggle to handle diverse objects in long-horizon tasks. To address these challenges, we present a unified framework for collaborative multi-robot, multi-object non-prehensile manipulation that integrates flow-matching co-generation with anonymous multi-robot motion planning. Within this framework, a generative model co-generates contact formations and manipulation trajectories from visual observations, while a novel motion planner conveys robots at scale. Crucially, the same planner also supports coordination at the object level, assigning manipulated objects to larger target structures and thereby unifying robot- and object-level reasoning within a single algorithmic framework. Experiments in challenging simulated environments demonstrate that our approach outperforms baselines in both motion planning and manipulation tasks, highlighting the benefits of generative co-design and integrated planning for scaling collaborative manipulation to complex multi-agent, multi-object settings.

Abstract: Most engineered pilings require substantially more force to be driven into the ground than they can resist during extraction. This requires relatively heavy equipment for insertion, which is problematic for anchoring in hard-to-access sites, including in extraterrestrial locations. In contrast, for tree roots, the external reaction force required to extract is much greater than required to insert--little more than the weight of the seed initiates insertion. This is partly due to the mechanism by which roots insert into the ground: tip extension. Proof-of-concept robotic prototypes have shown the benefits of using this mechanism, but a rigorous understanding of the underlying granular mechanics and how they inform the design of a robotic anchor is lacking. Here, we study the terradynamics of tip-extending anchors compared to traditional piling-like intruders, develop a set of design insights, and apply these to create a deployable robotic anchor. Specifically, we identify that to increase an anchor's ratio of extraction force to insertion force, it should: (i) extend beyond a critical depth; (ii) include hair-like protrusions; (iii) extend near-vertically, and (iv) incorporate multiple smaller anchors rather than a single large anchor. Synthesizing these insights, we developed a lightweight, soft robotic, root-inspired anchoring device that inserts into the ground with a reaction force less than its weight. We demonstrate that the 300 g device can deploy a series of temperature sensors 45 cm deep into loose Martian regolith simulant while anchoring with an average of 120 N, resulting in an anchoring-to-weight ratio of 40:1.

Abstract: The inherent difficulty and limited scalability of collecting manipulation data using multi-fingered robot hand hardware platforms have resulted in severe data scarcity, impeding research on data-driven dexterous manipulation policy learning. To address this challenge, we present a hand-agnostic manipulation transfer system. It efficiently converts human hand manipulation sequences from demonstration videos into high-quality dexterous manipulation trajectories without requirements of massive training data. To tackle the multi-dimensional disparities between human hands and dexterous hands, as well as the challenges posed by high-degree-of-freedom coordinated control of dexterous hands, we design a progressive transfer framework: first, we establish primary control signals for dexterous hands based on kinematic matching; subsequently, we train residual policies with action space rescaling and thumb-guided initialization to dynamically optimize contact interactions under unified rewards; finally, we compute wrist control trajectories with the objective of preserving operational semantics. Using only human hand manipulation videos, our system automatically configures system parameters for different tasks, balancing kinematic matching and dynamic optimization across dexterous hands, object categories, and tasks. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our framework can automatically generate smooth and semantically correct dexterous hand manipulation that faithfully reproduces human intentions, achieving high efficiency and strong generalizability with an average transfer success rate of 73%, providing an easily implementable and scalable method for collecting robot dexterous manipulation data.

Abstract: Coordination of movement and configuration in robotic swarms is a challenging endeavor. Deciding when and where each individual robot must move is a computationally complex problem. The challenge is further exacerbated by difficulties inherent to physical systems, such as measurement error and control dynamics. Thus, how to best determine the optimal path for each robot, when moving from one configuration to another, and how to best perform such determination and effect corresponding motion remains an open problem. In this paper, we show an algorithm for such coordination of robotic swarms. Our methods allow seamless transition from one configuration to another, leveraging geometric formulations that are mapped to the physical domain through appropriate control, localization, and mapping techniques. This paves the way for novel applications of robotic swarms by enabling more sophisticated distributed behaviors.

Conclusion: 准确的像素级环境预测对导航并非必要，在紧凑表示中进行预测和决策能显著提高计算效率，同时提升导航性能。

Abstract: Traditional navigation methods rely heavily on accurate localization and mapping. In contrast, world models that capture environmental dynamics in latent space have opened up new perspectives for navigation tasks, enabling systems to move beyond traditional multi-module pipelines. However, world model often suffers from high computational costs in both training and inference. To address this, we propose LS-NWM - a lightweight latent space navigation world model that is trained and operates entirely in latent space, compared to the state-of-the-art baseline, our method reduces training time by approximately 3.2x and planning time by about 447x,while further improving navigation performance with a 35% higher SR and an 11% higher SPL. The key idea is that accurate pixel-wise environmental prediction is unnecessary for navigation. Instead, the model predicts future latent states based on current observational features and action inputs, then performs path planning and decision-making within this compact representation, significantly improving computational efficiency. By incorporating an autoregressive multi-frame prediction strategy during training, the model effectively captures long-term spatiotemporal dependencies, thereby enhancing navigation performance in complex scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art navigation performance while maintaining a substantial efficiency advantage over existing approaches.

Conclusion: 混合抓取与非抓取操作是实现通用、人类水平机器人操作能力的关键步骤。

Abstract: Non-prehensile (NP) manipulation, in which robots alter object states without forming stable grasps (for example, pushing, poking, or sliding), significantly broadens robotic manipulation capabilities when grasping is infeasible or insufficient. However, enabling a unified framework that generalizes across different tasks, objects, and environments while seamlessly integrating non-prehensile and prehensile (P) actions remains challenging: robots must determine when to invoke NP skills, select the appropriate primitive for each context, and compose P and NP strategies into robust, multi-step plans. We introduce ApaptPNP, a vision-language model (VLM)-empowered task and motion planning framework that systematically selects and combines P and NP skills to accomplish diverse manipulation objectives. Our approach leverages a VLM to interpret visual scene observations and textual task descriptions, generating a high-level plan skeleton that prescribes the sequence and coordination of P and NP actions. A digital-twin based object-centric intermediate layer predicts desired object poses, enabling proactive mental rehearsal of manipulation sequences. Finally, a control module synthesizes low-level robot commands, with continuous execution feedback enabling online task plan refinement and adaptive replanning through the VLM. We evaluate ApaptPNP across representative P&NP hybrid manipulation tasks in both simulation and real-world environments. These results underscore the potential of hybrid P&NP manipulation as a crucial step toward general-purpose, human-level robotic manipulation capabilities.

Motivation: 现实世界是动态的，准静态交互不足以应对各种环境条件。为了向更动态的交互场景迈进，需要开发能够处理动态任务的仿人机器人控制器。

Method: 采用三阶段强化学习训练流程：首先学习步法，然后生成精确引导的球拍挥动，最后进行任务聚焦的细化。部署时结合扩展卡尔曼滤波器预测羽毛球轨迹，同时引入无预测变体。

Result: 仿真中两个机器人连续击球21次；无预测变体性能与已知目标策略相当；真实测试中控制器精度高，击球速度达10m/s，平均回球落点距离3.5m。

Conclusion: 仿人机器人能够在羽毛球中实现高度动态且精确的目标击球，并可适应更多动态关键领域。

Abstract: Humanoid robots have demonstrated strong capability for interacting with deterministic scenes across locomotion, manipulation, and more challenging loco-manipulation tasks. Yet the real world is dynamic, quasi-static interactions are insufficient to cope with the various environmental conditions. As a step toward more dynamic interaction scenario, we present a reinforcement-learning-based training pipeline that produces a unified whole-body controller for humanoid badminton, enabling coordinated lower-body footwork and upper-body striking without any motion priors or expert demonstrations. Training follows a three-stage curriculum: first footwork acquisition, then precision-guided racket swing generation, and finally task-focused refinement, yielding motions in which both legs and arms serve the hitting objective. For deployment, we incorporate an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to estimate and predict shuttlecock trajectories for target striking. We also introduce a prediction-free variant that dispenses with EKF and explicit trajectory prediction. To validate the framework, we conduct five sets of experiment in both simulation and the real world. In simulation, two robots sustain a rally of 21 consecutive hits. Moreover, the prediction-free variant achieves successful hits with comparable performance relative to the target-known policy. In real-world tests, both the prediction and controller module exhibit high accuracy, and on-court hitting achieves an outgoing shuttle speed up to 10 m/s with a mean return landing distance of 3.5 m. These experiment results show that our humanoid robot can deliver highly dynamic while precise goal striking in badminton, and can be adapted to more dynamism critical domains.

Abstract: Advanced robotic manipulation of deformable, volumetric objects remains one of the greatest challenges due to their pliancy, frailness, variability, and uncertainties during interaction. Motivated by these challenges, this article introduces Sashimi-Bot, an autonomous multi-robotic system for advanced manipulation and cutting, specifically the preparation of sashimi. The objects that we manipulate, salmon loins, are natural in origin and vary in size and shape, they are limp and deformable with poorly characterized elastoplastic parameters, while also being slippery and hard to hold. The three robots straighten the loin; grasp and hold the knife; cut with the knife in a slicing motion while cooperatively stabilizing the loin during cutting; and pick up the thin slices from the cutting board or knife blade. Our system combines deep reinforcement learning with in-hand tool shape manipulation, in-hand tool cutting, and feedback of visual and tactile information to achieve robustness to the variabilities inherent in this task. This work represents a milestone in robotic manipulation of deformable, volumetric objects that may inspire and enable a wide range of other real-world applications.

Abstract: Foundation models applied in robotics, particularly \textbf{Vision--Language--Action (VLA)} models, hold great promise for achieving general-purpose manipulation. Yet, systematic real-world evaluations and cross-model comparisons remain scarce. This paper reports our \textbf{empirical experiences} from benchmarking four representative VLAs -- \textbf{ACT}, \textbf{OpenVLA--OFT}, \textbf{RDT-1B}, and \boldmath{$π_0$} -- across four manipulation tasks conducted in both simulation and on the \textbf{ALOHA Mobile} platform. We establish a \textbf{standardized evaluation framework} that measures performance along three key dimensions: (1) \textit{accuracy and efficiency} (success rate and time-to-success), (2) \textit{adaptability} across in-distribution, spatial out-of-distribution, and instance-plus-spatial out-of-distribution settings, and (3) \textit{language instruction-following accuracy}. Through this process, we observe that \boldmath{$π_0$} demonstrates superior adaptability in out-of-distribution scenarios, while \textbf{ACT} provides the highest stability in-distribution. Further analysis highlights differences in computational demands, data-scaling behavior, and recurring failure modes such as near-miss grasps, premature releases, and long-horizon state drift. These findings reveal practical trade-offs among VLA model architectures in balancing precision, generalization, and deployment cost, offering actionable insights for selecting and deploying VLAs in real-world robotic manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Tactile sensing in biological organisms is deeply intertwined with morphological form, such as human fingers, cat paws, and elephant trunks, which enables rich and adaptive interactions through a variety of geometrically complex structures. In contrast, vision-based tactile sensors in robotics have been limited to simple planar geometries, with biomorphic designs remaining underexplored. To address this gap, we present SimTac, a physics-based simulation framework for the design and validation of biomorphic tactile sensors. SimTac consists of particle-based deformation modeling, light-field rendering for photorealistic tactile image generation, and a neural network for predicting mechanical responses, enabling accurate and efficient simulation across a wide range of geometries and materials. We demonstrate the versatility of SimTac by designing and validating physical sensor prototypes inspired by biological tactile structures and further demonstrate its effectiveness across multiple Sim2Real tactile tasks, including object classification, slip detection, and contact safety assessment. Our framework bridges the gap between bio-inspired design and practical realisation, expanding the design space of tactile sensors and paving the way for tactile sensing systems that integrate morphology and sensing to enable robust interaction in unstructured environments.

Conclusion: Embodied-SlotSSM框架能够实现基于时间的、上下文感知的动作预测，为解决非马尔可夫环境下的机器人操作问题提供了有效的可扩展方法。

Abstract: As embodied agents operate in increasingly complex environments, the ability to perceive, track, and reason about individual object instances over time becomes essential, especially in tasks requiring sequenced interactions with visually similar objects. In these non-Markovian settings, key decision cues are often hidden in object-specific histories rather than the current scene. Without persistent memory of prior interactions (what has been interacted with, where it has been, or how it has changed) visuomotor policies may fail, repeat past actions, or overlook completed ones. To surface this challenge, we introduce LIBERO-Mem, a non-Markovian task suite for stress-testing robotic manipulation under object-level partial observability. It combines short- and long-horizon object tracking with temporally sequenced subgoals, requiring reasoning beyond the current frame. However, vision-language-action (VLA) models often struggle in such settings, with token scaling quickly becoming intractable even for tasks spanning just a few hundred frames. We propose Embodied-SlotSSM, a slot-centric VLA framework built for temporal scalability. It maintains spatio-temporally consistent slot identities and leverages them through two mechanisms: (1) slot-state-space modeling for reconstructing short-term history, and (2) a relational encoder to align the input tokens with action decoding. Together, these components enable temporally grounded, context-aware action prediction. Experiments show Embodied-SlotSSM's baseline performance on LIBERO-Mem and general tasks, offering a scalable solution for non-Markovian reasoning in object-centric robotic policies.

Abstract: Tactile sensing offers rich and complementary information to vision and language, enabling robots to perceive fine-grained object properties. However, existing tactile sensors lack standardization, leading to redundant features that hinder cross-sensor generalization. Moreover, existing methods fail to fully integrate the intermediate communication among tactile, language, and vision modalities. To address this, we propose TLV-CoRe, a CLIP-based Tactile-Language-Vision Collaborative Representation learning method. TLV-CoRe introduces a Sensor-Aware Modulator to unify tactile features across different sensors and employs tactile-irrelevant decoupled learning to disentangle irrelevant tactile features. Additionally, a Unified Bridging Adapter is introduced to enhance tri-modal interaction within the shared representation space. To fairly evaluate the effectiveness of tactile models, we further propose the RSS evaluation framework, focusing on Robustness, Synergy, and Stability across different methods. Experimental results demonstrate that TLV-CoRe significantly improves sensor-agnostic representation learning and cross-modal alignment, offering a new direction for multimodal tactile representation.

Abstract: Coverage motion planning is essential to a wide range of robotic tasks. Unlike conventional motion planning problems, which reason over temporal sequences of states, coverage motion planning requires reasoning over the spatial distribution of entire trajectories, making standard motion planning methods limited in computational efficiency and less amenable to modern parallelization frameworks. In this work, we formulate the coverage motion planning problem as a statistical inference problem from the perspective of flow matching, a generative modeling technique that has gained significant attention in recent years. The proposed formulation unifies commonly used statistical discrepancy measures, such as Kullback-Leibler divergence and Sinkhorn divergence, with a standard linear quadratic regulator problem. More importantly, it decouples the generation of trajectory gradients for coverage from the synthesis of control under nonlinear system dynamics, enabling significant acceleration through parallelization on modern computational architectures, particularly Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). This paper focuses on the advantages of this formulation in terms of scalability through parallelization, highlighting its computational benefits compared to conventional methods based on waypoint tracking.

Abstract: Training generalist policies for robotic manipulation has shown great promise, as they enable language-conditioned, multi-task behaviors across diverse scenarios. However, evaluating these policies remains difficult because real-world testing is expensive, time-consuming, and labor-intensive. It also requires frequent environment resets and carries safety risks when deploying unproven policies on physical robots. Manually creating and populating simulation environments with assets for robotic manipulation has not addressed these issues, primarily due to the significant engineering effort required and the often substantial sim-to-real gap, both in terms of physics and rendering. In this paper, we explore the use of action-conditional video generation models as a scalable way to learn world models for policy evaluation. We demonstrate how to incorporate action conditioning into existing pre-trained video generation models. This allows leveraging internet-scale in-the-wild online videos during the pre-training stage, and alleviates the need for a large dataset of paired video-action data, which is expensive to collect for robotic manipulation. Our paper examines the effect of dataset diversity, pre-trained weight and common failure cases for the proposed evaluation pipeline.Our experiments demonstrate that, across various metrics, including policy ranking and the correlation between actual policy values and predicted policy values, these models offer a promising approach for evaluating policies without requiring real-world interactions.

Abstract: Successful autonomous robot navigation in off-road domains requires the ability to generate high-quality terrain costmaps that are able to both generalize well over a wide variety of terrains and rapidly adapt relative costs at test time to meet mission-specific needs. Existing approaches for costmap generation allow for either rapid test-time adaptation of relative costs (e.g., semantic segmentation methods) or generalization to new terrain types (e.g., representation learning methods), but not both. In this work, we present scaled preference conditioned all-terrain costmap generation (SPACER), a novel approach for generating terrain costmaps that leverages synthetic data during training in order to generalize well to new terrains, and allows for rapid test-time adaptation of relative costs by conditioning on a user-specified scaled preference context. Using large-scale aerial maps, we provide empirical evidence that SPACER outperforms other approaches at generating costmaps for terrain navigation, with the lowest measured regret across varied preferences in five of seven environments for global path planning.

However, existing formulations model the robot as a non-volumetric point, but in practice a robot interacts with the environment through its body and sensors with physical volume. In this work, we introduce a new ergodic control formulation that optimizes spatial coverage using a volumetric state representation. Our method preserves the asymptotic coverage guarantees of ergodic control, adds minimal computational overhead for real-time control, and supports arbitrary sample-based volumetric models. We evaluate our method across search and manipulation tasks -- with multiple robot dynamics and end-effector geometries or sensor models -- and show that it improves coverage efficiency by more than a factor of two while maintaining a 100% task completion rate across all experiments, outperforming the standard ergodic control method. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a robot arm performing mechanical erasing tasks.
