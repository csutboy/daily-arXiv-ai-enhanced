The proposed NMPC is\nimplemented to a non-holonomic vehicle with a differential drive system, using\nodometry data as localization feedback to guide the vehicle towards its target\npose while achieving objectives and adhering to constraints, such as obstacle\navoidance. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, a number of\nsimulations have been conducted in both obstacle-free and static obstacle\nenvironments. The SEATER model and testing environment have been developed in\nthe Gazebo Simulation and the NMPC are implemented within the Robot Operating\nSystem (ROS) framework. The simulation results demonstrate that the NMPC-based\napproach successfully controls the vehicle to reach the desired target location\nwhile satisfying the imposed constraints. Furthermore, this study highlights\nthe robustness and real-time effectiveness of NMPC with a single-shooting\napproach for autonomous vehicle control in the evaluated scenarios."}

The LLM Cascade is a paradigm\nthat defers difficult queries from weak/cheap to strong/expensive models. This\napproach is nonadaptive: the deferral decision is trained offline. When\nconfronted with similar or repeated queries, the LLM Cascade may then\nrepeatedly consult the expensive model and incur higher cost. To improve the\ncascading efficiency, we propose Inter-Cascade, an online and interactive LLM\nCascade that extends the role of strong model from a backup helper to a\nlong-term teacher. In our system, when a strong model resolves a difficult\nquery, it also distills its solution into a generalized, reusable\nproblem-solving strategy that boosts the weak model on subsequent queries.\nAdding strategies to queries enables the weak model to dynamically improve its\nperformance over time, avoiding computationally and time-intensive fine-tuning.\nEmpirically, compared with standard LLM Cascade baselines across multiple\nbenchmarks, the Inter-Cascade significantly improves the accuracy of the weak\nmodel (by up to 33.06 absolute percentage points) and the overall system (by up\nto 5.53 absolute percentage points), while reducing the calls to strong models\n(by up to 48.05% relative reduction) and saving the corresponding fees (by up\nto 49.63% relative reduction).

In 2021, the State Government of\nWestern Australia (WA) required attendees at \"Leavers\" -- a large-scale\nstate-supported graduation party held annually in November in a WA regional\ntown -- to be vaccinated. Using administrative data that link date-of-birth (at\nthe month level), school attendance, and first-dose vaccination records, we\nexploit the strict school-age laws in WA to run regression discontinuity\ndesigns (RDDs).

Classical planners often generate\ninefficient, high-cost plans by shuffling objects individually and using fixed\nbuffers--temporary spaces such as empty table regions or static stacks--to\nresolve conflicts. When only free table locations are used as buffers, dense\nscenes become inefficient, since placing an object can restrict others from\nreaching their goals and complicate planning. Allowing stacking provides extra\nbuffer capacity, but conventional stacking is static: once an object supports\nanother, the base cannot be moved, which limits efficiency. To overcome these\nissues, a novel planning primitive called the Dynamic Buffer is introduced.\nInspired by human grouping strategies, it enables robots to form temporary,\nmovable stacks that can be transported as a unit. This improves both\nfeasibility and efficiency in dense layouts, and it also reduces travel in\nlarge-scale settings where space is abundant. Compared with a state-of-the-art\nrearrangement planner, the approach reduces manipulator travel cost by 11.89%\nin dense scenarios with a stationary robot and by 5.69% in large, low-density\nsettings with a mobile manipulator. Practicality is validated through\nexperiments on a Delta parallel robot with a two-finger gripper.

Common methods, such\nas approximate convex decomposition, represent a mesh as a collection of simple\nparts, which are computationally inexpensive to simulate. However, existing\napproaches apply a uniform error tolerance across the entire mesh, which can\nresult in a sub-optimal trade-off between accuracy and performance. For\ninstance, a robot grasping an object needs high-fidelity geometry in the\nvicinity of the contact surfaces but can tolerate a coarser simplification\nelsewhere. A uniform tolerance can lead to excessive detail in non-critical\nareas or insufficient detail where it's needed most.\n  To address this limitation, we introduce Empart, an interactive tool that\nallows users to specify different simplification tolerances for selected\nregions of a mesh. Our method leverages existing convex decomposition\nalgorithms as a sub-routine but uses a novel, parallelized framework to handle\nregion-specific constraints efficiently.

Delegation may also\nundermine governance's legitimacy. This paper begins to develop a principled\nframework for when to delegate AI governance to AIs and when (and how) to\nmaintain human participation. Administrative law, which governs agencies that\nare (1) more expert in their domains than the legislatures that create them and\nthe courts that oversee them and (2) potentially misaligned to their original\ngoals, offers useful lessons. Administrative law doctrine provides examples of\nclear, articulated rules for when delegation can occur, what delegation can\nconsist of, and what processes can keep agencies aligned even as they are\nempowered to achieve their goals.

This paper\noffers a first attempt at a taxonomy to organize the diverse narratives of AI\neducation and to inform discipline-based curricular discussions. We place these\nnarratives within the enduring responsibility of higher education: the mission\nof knowledge. This mission includes not only the preservation and advancement\nof disciplinary expertise, but also the cultivation of skills and wisdom, i.e.,\nforms of meta-knowledge that encompass judgment, ethics, and social\nresponsibility. For the purpose of this paper's discussion, AI is defined as\nadaptive, data-driven systems that automate analysis, modeling, and\ndecision-making, highlighting its dual role as enabler and disruptor across\ndisciplines.

We show how disciplines evolve through the\ninterplay of research, curriculum, pedagogy, and faculty expertise, and why\ncurricular reform is the central lever for meaningful change. Pedagogical\ninnovation offers a strategic and accessible entry point, providing actionable\nsteps that help faculty and students build the expertise needed to engage in\ndeeper curricular rethinking and disciplinary renewal.

We present ARMimic, a novel framework\nthat overcomes these limitations with a lightweight and hardware-minimal setup\nfor scalable, robot-free data collection using only a consumer XR headset and a\nstationary workplace camera. ARMimic integrates egocentric hand tracking,\naugmented reality (AR) robot overlays, and real-time depth sensing to ensure\ncollision-aware, kinematically feasible demonstrations. A unified imitation\nlearning pipeline is at the core of our method, treating both human and virtual\nrobot trajectories as interchangeable, which enables policies that generalize\nacross different embodiments and environments. We validate ARMimic on two\nmanipulation tasks, including challenging long-horizon bowl stacking. In our\nexperiments, ARMimic reduces demonstration time by 50% compared to\nteleoperation and improves task success by 11% over ACT, a state-of-the-art\nbaseline trained on teleoperated data. Our results demonstrate that ARMimic\nenables safe, seamless, and in-the-wild data collection, offering great\npotential for scalable robot learning in diverse real-world settings."}

Almost universally, Large Language Models\n(LLMs) perform best on tasks which may be included in their training data and\ncan be accomplished solely using natural language, limiting our understanding\nof their emergent sophisticated cognitive capacities. In this work, we created\ndozens of novel items of a classic mental imagery task from cognitive\npsychology. A task which, traditionally, cognitive psychologists have argued is\nsolvable exclusively via visual mental imagery (i.e., language alone would be\ninsufficient). LLMs are perfect for testing this hypothesis. First, we tested\nseveral state-of-the-art LLMs by giving text-only models written instructions\nand asking them to report the resulting object after performing the\ntransformations in the aforementioned task. Then, we created a baseline by\ntesting 100 human subjects in exactly the same task. We found that the best\nLLMs performed significantly above average human performance. Finally, we\ntested reasoning models set to different levels of reasoning and found the\nstrongest performance when models allocate greater amounts of reasoning tokens.\nThese results provide evidence that the best LLMs may have the capability to\ncomplete imagery-dependent tasks despite the non-pictorial nature of their\narchitectures. Our study not only demonstrates an emergent cognitive capacity\nin LLMs while performing a novel task, but it also provides the field with a\nnew task that leaves lots of room for improvement in otherwise already highly\ncapable models. Finally, our findings reignite the debate over the formats of\nrepresentation of visual imagery in humans, suggesting that propositional\nreasoning (or at least non-imagistic reasoning) may be sufficient to complete\ntasks that were long-thought to be imagery-dependent."}

The main question in this paper is: to what extent can\nnon-discrimination law protect people against online price differentiation? The\npaper shows that online price differentiation and algorithmic decision-making\ncould lead to indirect discrimination, for instance harming people with a\ncertain ethnicity. Indirect discrimination occurs when a practice is neutral at\nfirst glance, but ends up discriminating against people with a protected\ncharacteristic, such as ethnicity. In principle, non-discrimination law\nprohibits indirect discrimination. The paper also shows, however, that\nnon-discrimination law has flaws when applied to algorithmic decision-making.\nFor instance, algorithmic discrimination can remain hidden: people may not\nrealise that they are being discriminated against.

Similarly, a key reason why today's vision language\nmodels (VLMs) hallucinate and underperform pure language models is that they\nrely on direct concatenation of image and text tokens with a modality-blinded\npositional encoding, which conveniently adopts the pretrained LLM backbone but\nforces unnecessary long-distance attention between semantically related tokens\nacross modalities. This underscores the urgent need for mechanisms that\nefficiently enhance token locality and cross-modal alignment. In response, we\npropose Attention Anchor, a parameter-free framework that efficiently groups\nsemantically similar tokens across modalities, improving cross-modal locality.\nBy inserting text tokens near relevant visual patches, we create semantic\nsignposts that reveal true content-based cross-modal attention scores, guiding\nthe model to focus on the correct image regions for tasks such as VQA, MMBench\nand POPE. This improves answer accuracy and reduces hallucinations without\ndisrupting the prompt's semantic flow. AttAnchor achieves improvements across\n13 out of 15 different metrics and benchmarks, including up to 32% gains on\nreasoning tasks and up to 15% improvements on hallucination benchmarks.\nAttAnchor enables TinyLLaVA 1B to outperform much larger models like LLaVA 7B\nand QwenVL 3B on POPE with only 0.1% inference time overhead.

It is shown that the stochastic gradient dynamics\nexhibit small-covariance NSS if the objective function satisfies the\n$\\mathcal{K}$-PL condition and possesses a globally Lipschitz continuous\ngradient. This result implies that the trajectories of stochastic gradient\ndynamics converge to a neighborhood of the optimum with high probability, with\nthe size of the neighborhood determined by the noise covariance.

To analyze the robustness of such\nstochastic gradient systems, the concept of small-covariance noise-to-state\nstability (NSS) is introduced, along with a Lyapunov-based characterization.\nFurthermore, the classical Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) condition on the objective\nfunction is generalized to the $\\mathcal{K}$-PL condition via comparison\nfunctions, thereby extending its applicability to a broader class of\noptimization problems. It is shown that the stochastic gradient dynamics\nexhibit small-covariance NSS if the objective function satisfies the\n$\\mathcal{K}$-PL condition and possesses a globally Lipschitz continuous\ngradient. This result implies that the trajectories of stochastic gradient\ndynamics converge to a neighborhood of the optimum with high probability, with\nthe size of the neighborhood determined by the noise covariance. Moreover, if\nthe $\\mathcal{K}$-PL condition is strengthened to a $\\mathcal{K}_\\infty$-PL\ncondition, the dynamics are NSS; whereas if it is weakened to a general\npositive-definite-PL condition, the dynamics exhibit integral NSS. The results\nfurther extend to objectives without globally Lipschitz gradients through\nappropriate step-size tuning.

When given the freedom to determine their\nown target amounts and betting sizes, bankruptcy rates rose substantially\nalongside increased irrational behavior, demonstrating that greater autonomy\namplifies risk-taking tendencies. Through neural circuit analysis using a\nSparse Autoencoder, we confirmed that model behavior is controlled by abstract\ndecision-making features related to risky and safe behaviors, not merely by\nprompts.

Conventional\nshared-control approaches often rely on fixed blending strategies that fail to\ncapture the dynamics of legged locomotion and may compromise safety. This paper\npresents a teleoperator-aware, safety-critical, adaptive nonlinear model\npredictive control (ANMPC) framework for shared autonomy of quadrupedal robots\nin obstacle-avoidance tasks. The framework employs a fixed arbitration weight\nbetween human and robot actions but enhances this scheme by modeling the human\ninput with a noisily rational Boltzmann model, whose parameters are adapted\nonline using a projected gradient descent (PGD) law from observed joystick\ncommands. Safety is enforced through control barrier function (CBF) constraints\nintegrated into a computationally efficient NMPC, ensuring forward invariance\nof safe sets despite uncertainty in human behavior. The control architecture is\nhierarchical: a high-level CBF-based ANMPC (10 Hz) generates blended\nhuman-robot velocity references, a mid-level dynamics-aware NMPC (60 Hz)\nenforces reduced-order single rigid body (SRB) dynamics to track these\nreferences, and a low-level nonlinear whole-body controller (500 Hz) imposes\nthe full-order dynamics via quadratic programming to track the mid-level\ntrajectories.

Given a problem\nthat the prover is unable to solve, Hilbert employs recursive decomposition to\nsplit the problem into subgoals that it solves with the prover or reasoner LLM.\nIt leverages verifier feedback to refine incorrect proofs as necessary.\nExperimental results demonstrate that Hilbert substantially outperforms\nexisting approaches on key benchmarks, achieving 99.2% on miniF2F, 6.6% points\nabove the best publicly available method. Hilbert achieves the best known\nresult on PutnamBench. It solves 462/660 problems (70.0%), outperforming\nproprietary approaches like SeedProver (50.4%) and achieving a 422% improvement\nover the best publicly available baseline. Thus, Hilbert effectively narrows\nthe gap between informal reasoning and formal proof generation."}

However, they\noften struggle with long-horizon tasks, leading to frequent failures. Process\nReward Models (PRMs) are a promising solution, as they can guide these agents\nwith crucial process signals during inference. Nevertheless, their application\nto the GUI domain presents unique challenges. When processing dense artificial\ninputs with long history data, PRMs suffer from a \"lost in the middle\"\nphenomenon, where the overwhelming historical context compromises the\nevaluation of the current step. Furthermore, standard PRMs lacks GUI changing\nawareness, providing static evaluations that are disconnected from the dynamic\nconsequences of actions, a critical mismatch with the inherently dynamic nature\nof GUI tasks. In response to these challenges, we introduce GUI-PRA (Process\nReward Agent for GUI Tasks), a judge agent designed to better provide process\nreward than standard PRM by intelligently processing historical context and\nactively perceiving UI state changes. Specifically, to directly combat the\n``lost in the middle'' phenomenon, we introduce a dynamic memory mechanism\nconsisting of two core components: a Relevance-based Retrieval Module to\nactively fetch pertinent information from long histories and a Progressive\nSummarization Module to dynamically condense growing interaction data, ensuring\nthe model focuses on relevant context. Moreover, to address the lack of UI\nchanging awareness, we introduce an Aadaptive UI Perception mechanism.

Classical planners often generate\ninefficient, high-cost plans by shuffling objects individually and using fixed\nbuffers--temporary spaces such as empty table regions or static stacks--to\nresolve conflicts. When only free table locations are used as buffers, dense\nscenes become inefficient, since placing an object can restrict others from\nreaching their goals and complicate planning. Allowing stacking provides extra\nbuffer capacity, but conventional stacking is static: once an object supports\nanother, the base cannot be moved, which limits efficiency. To overcome these\nissues, a novel planning primitive called the Dynamic Buffer is introduced.\nInspired by human grouping strategies, it enables robots to form temporary,\nmovable stacks that can be transported as a unit. This improves both\nfeasibility and efficiency in dense layouts, and it also reduces travel in\nlarge-scale settings where space is abundant. Compared with a state-of-the-art\nrearrangement planner, the approach reduces manipulator travel cost by 11.89%\nin dense scenarios with a stationary robot and by 5.69% in large, low-density\nsettings with a mobile manipulator. Practicality is validated through\nexperiments on a Delta parallel robot with a two-finger gripper.

The invariance of local representations\nfor task-relevant objects offers a solution. By efficiently utilizing these\nlocal representations, training and testing data can be mapped to a more\nsimilar feature space, thereby mitigating the covariate shift problem.\nAccordingly, we propose GLUE, a global-local unified encoding framework for\nimitation learning based on key-patch tracking. GLUE selects and tracks\nkey-patches as critical local representations by employing a text-guided\nmechanism. It features a novel fusion framework where global patch features\nquery local patches to distill essential information, yielding fine-grained\nlocal features with low heterogeneity relative to the global context. This\nfused representation steers the robot's visual attention toward task-relevant\nobjects and preserves precise global context, which together align the training\nand testing distributions into a similar and task-informative feature space,\nultimately enhancing the robustness of the imitation learning policy.\nExperiments demonstrate that GLUE achieves strong performance across diverse\ntasks in both simulation and real-world settings, outperforming the strongest\nbaseline by 17.6% in simulation, 36.3% in real-world environments, and 58.3% on\nreal-world generalization settings.

For\ninstance, a robot grasping an object needs high-fidelity geometry in the\nvicinity of the contact surfaces but can tolerate a coarser simplification\nelsewhere. A uniform tolerance can lead to excessive detail in non-critical\nareas or insufficient detail where it's needed most.\n  To address this limitation, we introduce Empart, an interactive tool that\nallows users to specify different simplification tolerances for selected\nregions of a mesh. Our method leverages existing convex decomposition\nalgorithms as a sub-routine but uses a novel, parallelized framework to handle\nregion-specific constraints efficiently. Empart provides a user-friendly\ninterface with visual feedback on approximation error and simulation\nperformance, enabling designers to iteratively refine their decomposition. We\ndemonstrate that our approach significantly reduces the number of convex parts\ncompared to a state-of-the-art method (V-HACD) at a fixed error threshold,\nleading to substantial speedups in simulation performance. For a robotic\npick-and-place task, Empart-generated collision meshes reduced the overall\nsimulation time by 69% compared to a uniform decomposition, highlighting the\nvalue of interactive, region-specific simplification for performant robotics\napplications."}

We introduce Asynchronous\nAction Chunk Correction (A2C2), which is a lightweight real-time chunk\ncorrection head that runs every control step and adds a time-aware correction\nto any off-the-shelf VLA's action chunk. The module combines the latest\nobservation, the predicted action from VLA (base action), a positional feature\nthat encodes the index of the base action within the chunk, and some features\nfrom the base policy, then outputs a per-step correction. This preserves the\nbase model's competence while restoring closed-loop responsiveness. The\napproach requires no retraining of the base policy and is orthogonal to\nasynchronous execution schemes such as Real Time Chunking (RTC). On the dynamic\nKinetix task suite (12 tasks) and LIBERO Spatial, our method yields consistent\nsuccess rate improvements across increasing delays and execution horizons (+23%\npoint and +7% point respectively, compared to RTC), and also improves\nrobustness for long horizons even with zero injected delay.

The Good Weights (GW) algorithm described here provides\na framework to adaptively integrate dead reckoning (DR) with passive visual\nSLAM for continuous and accurate frame-level pose estimation. Importantly, it\ndescribes how all modules in a comprehensive SLAM system must be modified to\nincorporate DR into its design. Adaptive weighting increases DR influence when\nvisual tracking is unreliable and reduces when visual feature information is\nstrong, maintaining pose track without overreliance on DR. Good Weights yields\na practical solution for mobile navigation that improves visual SLAM\nperformance and robustness. Experiments on collected datasets and in real-world\ndeployment demonstrate the benefits of Good Weights."}

However, it also raises significant\nethical concerns, including bias issues. Although numerous efforts have been\nmade to quantify and mitigate social bias in AI models, geographic bias (in\nshort, geo-bias) receives much less attention, which presents unique\nchallenges. While previous work has explored ways to quantify geo-bias, these\nmeasures are model-specific (e.g., mean absolute deviation of LLM ratings) or\nspatially implicit (e.g., average fairness scores of all spatial partitions).\nWe lack a model-agnostic, universally applicable, and spatially explicit\ngeo-bias evaluation framework that allows researchers to fairly compare the\ngeo-bias of different AI models and to understand what spatial factors\ncontribute to the geo-bias. In this paper, we establish an\ninformation-theoretic framework for geo-bias evaluation, called GeoBS (Geo-Bias\nScores). We demonstrate the generalizability of the proposed framework by\nshowing how to interpret and analyze existing geo-bias measures under this\nframework. Then, we propose three novel geo-bias scores that explicitly take\nintricate spatial factors (multi-scalability, distance decay, and anisotropy)\ninto consideration. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on 3 tasks, 8\ndatasets, and 8 models to demonstrate that both task-specific GeoAI models and\ngeneral-purpose foundation models may suffer from various types of geo-bias.\nThis framework will not only advance the technical understanding of geographic\nbias but will also establish a foundation for integrating spatial fairness into\nthe design, deployment, and evaluation of AI systems."}

If so, it crafts and broadcasts a\nnatural language (NL) help request. Potential helper robots reason over the\nrequest and respond with offers of assistance, including information about the\neffect on their ongoing tasks.

Finally, the requester robot selects a\nhelper by reasoning over the expected increase in system-level total task\ncompletion time.

It (1) uses a spatially consistent semantic voxel-ray map as\npersistent memory, enabling long-horizon planning and avoiding purely reactive\nbehaviors, (2) combines short-range voxel search and long-range ray search to\nscale to large environments, (3) leverages a large vision-language model to\nsuggest auxiliary cues, mitigating sparsity of outdoor targets. These\ncomponents are coordinated by a behavior tree, which adaptively switches\nbehaviors for robust operation. We evaluate RAVEN in 10 photorealistic outdoor\nsimulation environments over 100 semantic tasks, encompassing single-object\nsearch, multi-class, multi-instance navigation and sequential task changes.\nResults show RAVEN outperforms baselines by 85.25% in simulation and\ndemonstrate its real-world applicability through deployment on an aerial robot\nin outdoor field tests."}

Equipped with the theory,\nwe propose \\textit{Annealed-RLVR}, a principled algorithm that introduces an\nSFT-based ``heating'' step at the point of maximal frustration to resolve the\ncompetitive bottleneck and enhance the reasoning capability of the model.\nExperiments on a 1.5B-parameter model demonstrate that the approach outperforms\nstandard RLVR on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution benchmarks. By\nrecasting RLVR from black-box optimization into a predictable process of\nstructural self-organization, our work provides a new physical intuition for\nengineering the emergent reasoning capabilities of future AI systems."}

In response, we\npropose Attention Anchor, a parameter-free framework that efficiently groups\nsemantically similar tokens across modalities, improving cross-modal locality.\nBy inserting text tokens near relevant visual patches, we create semantic\nsignposts that reveal true content-based cross-modal attention scores, guiding\nthe model to focus on the correct image regions for tasks such as VQA, MMBench\nand POPE. This improves answer accuracy and reduces hallucinations without\ndisrupting the prompt's semantic flow. AttAnchor achieves improvements across\n13 out of 15 different metrics and benchmarks, including up to 32% gains on\nreasoning tasks and up to 15% improvements on hallucination benchmarks.\nAttAnchor enables TinyLLaVA 1B to outperform much larger models like LLaVA 7B\nand QwenVL 3B on POPE with only 0.1% inference time overhead. To the best of\nour knowledge, this work is among the first to investigate mixed-modal token\ngrouping, where text and image tokens are clustered jointly into shared groups\nrather than being grouped within a single modality or merely aligned post-hoc\nwith additional alignment losses."}

At the same time, emerging low-code and\ntemplate-based agent development platforms (e.g., Dify) enable users to rapidly\nbuild and orchestrate agentic systems, which we refer to as\nplatform-orchestrated agentic systems. However, these systems are also fragile\nand it remains unclear how to systematically identify their potential failure\nroot cause. This paper presents a study of root cause identification of these\nplatform-orchestrated agentic systems. To support this initiative, we construct\na dataset AgentFail containing 307 failure logs from ten agentic systems, each\nwith fine-grained annotations linking failures to their root causes. We\nadditionally utilize counterfactual reasoning-based repair strategy to ensure\nthe reliability of the annotation. Building on the dataset, we develop a\ntaxonomy that characterizes failure root causes and analyze their distribution\nacross different platforms and task domains. Furthermore, we introduce a\nbenchmark that leverages LLMs for automatically identifying root causes, in\nwhich we also utilize the proposed taxonomy as guidance for LLMs. Results show\nthat the taxonomy can largely improve the performance, thereby confirming its\nutility. Nevertheless, the accuracy of root cause identification reaches at\nmost 33.6%, which indicates that this task still remains challenging. In light\nof these results, we also provide actionable guidelines for building such\nagentic systems.

A major AV\nproblem that gained popularity is the 3D reconstruction of targeted\nenvironments using 2D images from diverse viewpoints. While collecting and\nprocessing a large number of arbitrarily captured 2D images can be arduous in\nmany practical scenarios, a more efficient solution involves optimizing the\nplacement of available cameras in 3D space to capture fewer, yet more\ninformative, images that provide sufficient visual information for effective\nreconstruction of the environment of interest. This process termed as view\nplanning (VP), can be markedly challenged (i) by noise emerging in the location\nof the cameras and/or in the extracted images, and (ii) by the need to\ngeneralize well in other unknown similar agricultural environments without need\nfor re-optimizing or re-training. To cope with these challenges, the present\nwork presents a novel VP framework that considers a reconstruction\nquality-based optimization formulation that relies on the notion of\n`structure-from-motion' to reconstruct the 3D structure of the sought\nenvironment from the selected 2D images. With no analytic expression of the\noptimization function and with costly function evaluations, a Bayesian\noptimization approach is proposed to efficiently carry out the VP process using\nonly a few function evaluations, while accounting for different noise cases.\nNumerical tests on both simulated and real agricultural settings signify the\nbenefits of the advocated VP approach in efficiently estimating the optimal\ncamera placement to accurately reconstruct 3D environments of interest, and\ngeneralize well on similar unknown environments."}

We\npresent SPARTA, the first unified framework for the family of object state\nchange manipulation tasks. Our key insight is that these tasks share a common\nstructural pattern: they involve spatially-progressing, object-centric changes\nthat can be represented as regions transitioning from an actionable to a\ntransformed state. Building on this insight, SPARTA integrates spatially\nprogressing object change segmentation maps, a visual skill to perceive\nactionable vs. transformed regions for specific object state change tasks, to\ngenerate a) structured policy observations that strip away appearance\nvariability, and b) dense rewards that capture incremental progress over time.\nThese are leveraged in two SPARTA policy variants: reinforcement learning for\nfine-grained control without demonstrations or simulation; and greedy control\nfor fast, lightweight deployment. We validate SPARTA on a real robot for three\nchallenging tasks across 10 diverse real-world objects, achieving significant\nimprovements in training time and accuracy over sparse rewards and visual\ngoal-conditioned baselines.

In\nsummary, CANON based on entropy consistently outperforms prior methods across\nthree LLMs on both math reasoning and high-complexity logic tasks. When applied\nto response length, CANON further improves token efficiency, yielding a more\nfavorable Pareto frontier in the performance-cost trade-off."}

We\nidentify a compact power law that links model size and expert number: the\nsize-dependent floor decreases with model capacity, while the merging tail\nexhibits clear diminishing returns in the number of experts. The law holds\nin-domain and cross-domain, tightly fits measured curves across diverse\narchitectures and methods (Average, TA, TIES, DARE), and explains two robust\nregularities: most gains arrive early, and variability shrinks as more experts\nare included.

To address these\nissues, we propose SSR-ZSON, a spatial-semantic relative zero-shot object\nnavigation method based on the TARE hierarchical exploration framework,\nintegrating a viewpoint generation strategy balancing spatial coverage and\nsemantic density with an LLM-based global guidance mechanism. The performance\nimprovement of the proposed method is due to two key innovations.

DRCP\nintegrates two key components: (1) Precise-Pyramid-Cross-Modality-Cross-Agent,\na cross-modal cooperative perception module that leverages\ncamera-intrinsic-aware angular partitioning for attention-based fusion and\nadaptive convolution to better exploit external features; and (2)\nMask-Diffusion-Mask-Aggregation, a novel lightweight diffusion-based refinement\nmodule that encourages robustness against feature perturbations and aligns\nbird's-eye-view features closer to the task-optimal manifold. The proposed\nsystem achieves real-time performance on mobile platforms while significantly\nimproving robustness under challenging conditions. Code will be released in\nlate 2025."}

To have an intuitive interaction, we argue that the agent should be\nable to learn incrementally from a few single examples. To allow for this, our\nobjective is to broaden the agent's task understanding using domain knowledge.\nThen, using a learning method to enable the agent to learn efficiently from a\nlimited number of examples. Finally, to optimize how human can select the most\nrepresentative and less redundant examples to provide the agent with. We apply\nour proposed method to the subjective task of ingredient substitution, where\nthe agent needs to learn how to substitute ingredients in recipes based on\nhuman examples. We replicate human input using the Recipe1MSubs dataset. In our\nexperiments, the agent achieves half its task performance after only 100\nexamples are provided, compared to the complete training set of 50k examples.\nWe show that by providing examples in strategic order along with a learning\nmethod that leverages external symbolic knowledge, the agent can generalize\nmore efficiently."}

In this work, we posit that\nLLM logical reasoning performance is jointly constrained by the potential of\nthe training data and the cognitive capacity of the model. To make this\nrelationship measurable, we introduce Data Reasoning Intensity (DRI), a novel\nmetric that quantifies the latent logical reasoning complexity of samples by\ndecomposing and aggregating their logical structures.

While recent learning-based approaches have\npushed the field forward, most methods still rely on manually designed action\nparameterizations, limiting their ability to produce the highly coordinated\nmotions required in complex tasks. Motion planning can generate feasible\ntrajectories, but the dynamics gap-stemming from control inaccuracies, contact\nuncertainties, and aerodynamic effects-often causes large deviations between\nplanned and executed trajectories. In this work, we propose Dynamics-Aware\nMotion Manifold Primitives (DA-MMP), a motion generation framework for\ngoal-conditioned dynamic manipulation, and instantiate it on a challenging\nreal-world ring-tossing task. Our approach extends motion manifold primitives\nto variable-length trajectories through a compact parametrization and learns a\nhigh-quality manifold from a large-scale dataset of planned motions. Building\non this manifold, a conditional flow matching model is trained in the latent\nspace with a small set of real-world trials, enabling the generation of\nthrowing trajectories that account for execution dynamics.

Classical planners often generate\ninefficient, high-cost plans by shuffling objects individually and using fixed\nbuffers--temporary spaces such as empty table regions or static stacks--to\nresolve conflicts. When only free table locations are used as buffers, dense\nscenes become inefficient, since placing an object can restrict others from\nreaching their goals and complicate planning. Allowing stacking provides extra\nbuffer capacity, but conventional stacking is static: once an object supports\nanother, the base cannot be moved, which limits efficiency. To overcome these\nissues, a novel planning primitive called the Dynamic Buffer is introduced.\nInspired by human grouping strategies, it enables robots to form temporary,\nmovable stacks that can be transported as a unit. This improves both\nfeasibility and efficiency in dense layouts, and it also reduces travel in\nlarge-scale settings where space is abundant. Compared with a state-of-the-art\nrearrangement planner, the approach reduces manipulator travel cost by 11.89%\nin dense scenarios with a stationary robot and by 5.69% in large, low-density\nsettings with a mobile manipulator.

This mission includes not only the preservation and advancement\nof disciplinary expertise, but also the cultivation of skills and wisdom, i.e.,\nforms of meta-knowledge that encompass judgment, ethics, and social\nresponsibility. For the purpose of this paper's discussion, AI is defined as\nadaptive, data-driven systems that automate analysis, modeling, and\ndecision-making, highlighting its dual role as enabler and disruptor across\ndisciplines.

Therefore, our\naugmented maximal clique approach selectively includes some non-maximal cliques\nto mitigate the overrepresentation of specific nodes and promote more balanced\nlearning across the network. Comparative analyses on synthetic networks and\nreal-world citation datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms approaches\nbased on pairwise interactions, all cliques, or only maximal cliques.

The main question in this paper is: to what extent can\nnon-discrimination law protect people against online price differentiation?

A major AV\nproblem that gained popularity is the 3D reconstruction of targeted\nenvironments using 2D images from diverse viewpoints. While collecting and\nprocessing a large number of arbitrarily captured 2D images can be arduous in\nmany practical scenarios, a more efficient solution involves optimizing the\nplacement of available cameras in 3D space to capture fewer, yet more\ninformative, images that provide sufficient visual information for effective\nreconstruction of the environment of interest. This process termed as view\nplanning (VP), can be markedly challenged (i) by noise emerging in the location\nof the cameras and/or in the extracted images, and (ii) by the need to\ngeneralize well in other unknown similar agricultural environments without need\nfor re-optimizing or re-training. To cope with these challenges, the present\nwork presents a novel VP framework that considers a reconstruction\nquality-based optimization formulation that relies on the notion of\n`structure-from-motion' to reconstruct the 3D structure of the sought\nenvironment from the selected 2D images. With no analytic expression of the\noptimization function and with costly function evaluations, a Bayesian\noptimization approach is proposed to efficiently carry out the VP process using\nonly a few function evaluations, while accounting for different noise cases.\nNumerical tests on both simulated and real agricultural settings signify the\nbenefits of the advocated VP approach in efficiently estimating the optimal\ncamera placement to accurately reconstruct 3D environments of interest, and\ngeneralize well on similar unknown environments."}

By using\ngeofences to monitor human activity across their boundaries, content providers\ncan create spatially triggered events that include notifications about points\nof interest within a geofence by pushing spatial information to the devices of\nusers. Traditionally, geofences were hand-crafted by providers. In addition to\nthe hand-crafted approach, recent advances in collecting human mobility data\nthrough mobile devices can accelerate the automatic and data-driven design of\ngeofences, also known as the geofence design problem. Previous approaches\nassume circular shapes; thus, their flexibility is insufficient, and they can\nonly handle geofence-based applications for large areas with coarse\nresolutions. A challenge with using circular geofences in urban and\nhigh-resolution areas is that they often overlap and fail to align with\npolitical district boundaries and road segments, such as one-way streets and\nmedian barriers. In this study, we address the problem of extracting arbitrary\nshapes as geofences from human mobility data to mitigate this problem. In our\nformulation, we cast the existing optimization problems for circular geofences\nto 0-1 integer programming problems to represent arbitrary shapes. Although 0-1\ninteger programming problems are computationally hard, formulating them as\nquadratic (unconstrained) binary optimization problems enables efficient\napproximation of optimal solutions, because this allows the use of specialized\nquadratic solvers, such as the quantum annealing, and other state-of-the-art\nalgorithms.

The goal\nis to construct the shortest path connecting given initial and final\nconfigurations subject to motion constraints. Our work differs from existing\nliterature in two ways. First, we consider full vehicle orientation using a\nbody-attached frame, which includes roll, pitch, and yaw angles. However,\nexisting work uses only pitch and/or heading angle, which is insufficient to\nuniquely determine orientation. Second, we use two control inputs to represent\nbounded pitch and yaw rates, reflecting control by two separate actuators. In\ncontrast, most previous methods rely on a single input, such as path curvature,\nwhich is insufficient for accurately modeling the vehicle's kinematics in 3D.\nWe use a rotation minimizing frame to describe the vehicle's configuration and\nits evolution, and construct paths by concatenating optimal Dubins paths on\nspherical, cylindrical, or planar surfaces.

However, recent\nstudies reveal that their final answers often contradict their own reasoning\ntraces. We hypothesize that this inconsistency stems from two competing\nmechanisms for generating answers: CoT reasoning and memory retrieval. To test\nthis hypothesis, we conduct controlled experiments that challenge LRMs with\nmisleading cues during reasoning and/or corrupted answers during retrieval. Our\nresults across models and datasets confirm that both mechanisms operate\nsimultaneously, with their relative dominance influenced by multiple factors:\nproblem domains, model scales, and fine-tuning approaches (e.g., reinforcement\nlearning vs. distillation). The findings reveal a critical limitation in\ncurrent reasoning fine-tuning paradigms: models can exploit the retrieval\nmechanism as a shortcut, effectively \"hacking\" the reward signal and\nundermining genuine reasoning development. To address this challenge, we\nintroduce FARL, a novel fine-tuning framework that integrates memory unlearning\nwith reinforcement learning.

However, these methods are all\nunderpinned by a critical, yet flawed assumption: human preferences are\nhomogeneous (representing a single, unified preference) and the collected data\nis noiseless (free from error). In reality, neither is true since human\npreference is pluralistic and annotators can make mistakes. This creates a\ndiscrepancy between the recorded data and the ground-truth preferences, which\ncan misguide the model and degrade its performance. To address this challenge,\nwe introduce Robust Preference Optimization (RPO). RPO employs an\nExpectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to infer the posterior probability of\neach label's correctness, which is used to adaptively re-weigh each data point\nin the training loss to mitigate noise. We further generalize this approach by\nestablishing a theoretical link between arbitrary preference losses and their\ncorresponding probabilistic models. This generalization enables the systematic\ntransformation of existing alignment algorithms into their robust counterparts,\nelevating RPO from a specific algorithm to a meta-framework for robust\npreference alignment. Theoretically, we prove that under the condition of a\nperfectly calibrated model, RPO is guaranteed to converge to the true noise\nlevel of the dataset. Our experiments demonstrate RPO's effectiveness as a\nmeta-framework, consistently enhancing four state-of-the-art alignment\nalgorithms (DPO, IPO, SimPO, and CPO).

We introduce Memory Transfer Planning (MTP), a framework that\nleverages successful control-code examples from different environments as\nprocedural knowledge, using them as in-context guidance for LLM-driven\nplanning. Specifically, MTP (i) generates an initial plan and code using LLMs,\n(ii) retrieves relevant successful examples from a code memory, and (iii)\ncontextually adapts the retrieved code to the target setting for re-planning\nwithout updating model parameters.

To this end, this paper\nproposes to use multimodal LLMs as high-level planners for such long-horizon\nrobotic stacking tasks.

We prove that online\non-policy sampling better approximates the human-perceived distribution of what\nthe model can produce, and PPO/GRPO-style clipping -- originally introduced to\njust stabilize training -- recovers a perceptual bias in how humans perceive\nprobability. In this sense, PPO/GRPO act as perceptual losses already. Our\ntheory further suggests that the online/offline dichotomy is itself incidental\nto maximizing human utility, since we can achieve the same effect by\nselectively training on any data in a manner that mimics human perception,\nrather than restricting ourselves to online on-policy data. Doing so would\nallow us to post-train more quickly, cheaply, and flexibly without sacrificing\nperformance.

The dissipativity concept provides a practical framework for\naddressing such concerns, thanks to the energy-based representation it offers\nfor subsystems and the compositional properties it provides for the analysis\nand control of interconnected (networked) systems comprised of such subsystems.\nTherefore, in this paper, we utilize the dissipativity concept to analyze and\ncontrol a spreading process that occurs over a hierarchy of nodes, groups, and\na network (i.e., a spreading network). We start by generalizing some existing\nresults on dissipativity-based topology design for networked systems. Next, we\nmodel the considered spreading network as a networked system and establish the\ndissipativity properties of its nodes. The generalized topology design method\nis then applied at multiple levels of the considered spreading network to\nformulate its analysis and control problems as Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI)\nproblems.

However, existing multimodal time series datasets\nmostly remain at the level of surface alignment and question answering, without\nreaching the depth of genuine reasoning. The absence of well-defined tasks that\ngenuinely require time series reasoning, along with the scarcity of\nhigh-quality data, has limited progress in building practical time series\nreasoning models (TSRMs). To this end, we introduce Time Series Reasoning Suite\n(TSR-Suite), which formalizes four atomic tasks that span three fundamental\ncapabilities for reasoning with time series: (1) perception, acquired through\nscenario understanding and causality discovery; (2) extrapolation, realized via\nevent-aware forecasting; and (3) decision-making, developed through\ndeliberation over perception and extrapolation. TSR-Suite is the first\ncomprehensive time series reasoning suite that supports not only thorough\nevaluation but also the data pipeline and training of TSRMs. It contains more\nthan 23K samples, of which 2.3K are carefully curated through a human-guided\nhierarchical annotation process. Building on this foundation, we introduce\nTimeOmni-1, the first unified reasoning model designed to address diverse\nreal-world problems demanding time series reasoning. The model is trained in\nmultiple stages, integrating a mixture of task scenarios, novel reward\nfunctions, and tailored optimizations. Experiments show that TimeOmni-1\ndelivers strong out-of-distribution generalization across all tasks and\nachieves a high rate of valid responses. It significantly improves causality\ndiscovery accuracy (64.0% vs. 35.9% with GPT-4.1) and raises the valid response\nrate by over 6% compared to GPT-4.1 on the event-aware forecasting task."}

Existing methods uncover global capability circuits\n(e.g., indirect object identification), but not why the model answers a\nspecific input query in a particular way.

Unlike surrogate-based approaches (e.g., sparse autoencoders),\nquery circuits are identified within the model itself, resulting in more\nfaithful and computationally accessible explanations. To make query circuits\npractical, we address two challenges. First, we introduce Normalized Deviation\nFaithfulness (NDF), a robust metric to evaluate how well a discovered circuit\nrecovers the model's decision for a specific input, and is broadly applicable\nto circuit discovery beyond our setting. Second, we develop sampling-based\nmethods to efficiently identify circuits that are sparse yet faithfully\ndescribe the model's behavior. Across benchmarks (IOI, arithmetic, MMLU, and\nARC), we find that there exist extremely sparse query circuits within the model\nthat can recover much of its performance on single queries.

Although reinforcement learning\n(RL)-based post-training has proven effective in addressing data scarcity, its\napplication to VLA models is hindered by the non-resettable nature of\nreal-world environments. This limitation is particularly critical in high-risk\ndomains such as industrial automation, where interactions often induce state\nchanges that are costly or infeasible to revert. Furthermore, existing VLA\napproaches lack a reliable mechanism for detecting task completion, leading to\nredundant actions that reduce overall task success rates. To address these\nchallenges, we propose World-Env, an RL-based post-training framework that\nreplaces physical interaction with a low-cost, world model-based virtual\nsimulator. World-Env consists of two key components: (1) a video-based world\nsimulator that generates temporally consistent future visual observations, and\n(2) a vision-language model (VLM)-guided instant reflector that provides\ncontinuous reward signals and predicts action termination. This simulated\nenvironment enables VLA models to safely explore and generalize beyond their\ninitial imitation learning distribution.

We partition the task space into cognitive and physical components with\ndifferential automation costs, allowing infinite costs for some physical\nbottlenecks. Our key result shows that when physical tasks constitute economic\nbottlenecks with sufficiently high (or infinite) computational requirements,\nthe labor share of income converges to a positive constant in the\nfinite-compute regime (rather than zero). This fundamentally alters the\ndistributional implications of AGI while preserving the growth dynamics for\ncognitive-intensive economies."}
