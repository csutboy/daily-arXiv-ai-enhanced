The key idea is simple:\nwe design a controller to be optimal for a proxy objective built on an\navailable model while penalizing mismatches with the real system, so that the\nresulting controller is also optimal for the actual system. Building on the\noriginal CLC formulation, we demonstrate the framework to the linear quadratic\nregulator problem and make three advances: (i) we show that the CLC penalty is\na sequence of stage-specific weights rather than a single constant; (ii) we\nidentify when these weights can be set in advance and when they must depend on\nthe (unknown) dynamics; and (iii) we develop a lightweight learning loop that\ntunes the weights directly from data without abandoning the benefits of a\nmodel-based design. We provide a complete algorithm and an empirical study\nagainst common baseline methods. The results clarify where prior knowledge\nsuffices and where learning is essential, and they position CLC as a practical,\ntheoretically grounded bridge between classical optimal control and modern\nlearning methods."}

Signal Temporal Logic (STL)\noffers a powerful and expressive language for specifying such tasks, but its\nnon-Markovian nature and inherent sparse reward make it difficult to be solved\nvia standard Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms. Prior RL approaches focus\nonly on limited STL fragments or use STL robustness scores as sparse terminal\nrewards. In this paper, we propose TGPO, Temporal Grounded Policy Optimization,\nto solve general STL tasks. TGPO decomposes STL into timed subgoals and\ninvariant constraints and provides a hierarchical framework to tackle the\nproblem. The high-level component of TGPO proposes concrete time allocations\nfor these subgoals, and the low-level time-conditioned policy learns to achieve\nthe sequenced subgoals using a dense, stage-wise reward signal. During\ninference, we sample various time allocations and select the most promising\nassignment for the policy network to rollout the solution trajectory. To foster\nefficient policy learning for complex STL with multiple subgoals, we leverage\nthe learned critic to guide the high-level temporal search via\nMetropolis-Hastings sampling, focusing exploration on temporally feasible\nsolutions. We conduct experiments on five environments, ranging from\nlow-dimensional navigation to manipulation, drone, and quadrupedal locomotion.\nUnder a wide range of STL tasks, TGPO significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art baselines (especially for high-dimensional and long-horizon\ncases), with an average of 31.6% improvement in task success rate compared to\nthe best baseline.

MO-IRL\niteratively refines cost weights by scaling observed and generated trajectories\nin the maximum entropy IRL formulation, greatly reducing the number of required\ndemonstrations and convergence time compared to classical IRL approaches.\nTraining on ten trials per posture yields average joint-angle Root Mean Squared\nErrors (RMSE) of 6.4 deg and 5.6 deg for six- and eight-segment weight\ndivisions, respectively, versus 10.4 deg using a single static weight.\nCross-validation on remaining trials and, for the first time, inter-subject\nvalidation on an unseen subject's 20 trials, demonstrates comparable predictive\naccuracy, around 8 deg RMSE, indicating robust generalization.

The recent\nintegration of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has further enhanced prediction\naccuracy in contemporary social recommendation algorithms.

In this study, we confront this\nchallenge by introducing SoREX, a self-explanatory GNN-based social\nrecommendation framework. SoREX adopts a two-tower framework enhanced by friend\nrecommendation, independently modeling social relations and user-item\ninteractions, while jointly optimizing an auxiliary task to reinforce social\nsignals. To offer explanations, we propose a novel ego-path extraction\napproach. This method involves transforming the ego-net of a target user into a\ncollection of multi-hop ego-paths, from which we extract factor-specific and\ncandidate-aware ego-path subsets as explanations. This process facilitates the\nsummarization of detailed comparative explanations among different candidate\nitems through intricate substructure analysis.

When acquiring feedback signals such as the inductor current,\nsynchronizing the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) with the digital\npulse-width modulator (DPWM) is commonly employed to accurately track their\nsteady-state average. However, the small-signal implications of such\nsynchronization have not been investigated. This paper presents an exact\nsmall-signal model for digitally controlled buck converters operating in forced\ncontinuous-conduction mode (FCCM) under constant-frequency current-mode\ncontrol, explicitly accounting for DPWM-ADC synchronization. Using a\nsampled-data framework, the proposed model captures all sideband effects\nintroduced by the sampling process, yielding precise predictions of both analog\nand digital loop gains, even at frequencies beyond the switching and sampling\nfrequencies. Both asymmetrical and symmetrical carrier modulations are\nconsidered. Furthermore, the digital loop gain is derived in closed form using\nthe modified z-transform, enabling low-complexity compensator design and\nstability assessment. Within this framework, the analog loop gain can be\ndirectly obtained from the digital loop gain, thereby eliminating the need for\ncomputationally intensive infinite series evaluations. The validity of the\nproposed model is confirmed through both simulation and experimental results."}

In the first stage, Doppler measurements are employed\nto detect pseudo-range outliers in a GNSS-only manner, since Doppler is less\nsensitive to multipath and NLOS effects compared with pseudo-range, making it a\nmore stable reference for detecting sudden inconsistencies. In the second\nstage, pre-integrated inertial measurement units (IMU) and odometer constraints\nare used to generate predicted double-difference pseudo-range measurements,\nwhich enable a more refined identification and rejection of remaining outliers.\nBy combining these two complementary stages, the system achieves improved\nrobustness against both gross pseudo-range errors and degraded satellite\nmeasuring quality.

However, most existing Vision-Language-Action\nmodels (VLAs) have been designed without considering this aspect, i.e., they\nrely solely on the current observation, ignoring preceding context. In this\npaper, we propose HAMLET, a scalable framework to adapt VLAs to attend to the\nhistorical context during action prediction. Specifically, we introduce moment\ntokens that compactly encode perceptual information at each timestep. Their\nrepresentations are initialized with time-contrastive learning, allowing them\nto better capture temporally distinctive aspects. Next, we employ a lightweight\nmemory module that integrates the moment tokens across past timesteps into\nmemory features, which are then leveraged for action prediction. Through\nempirical evaluation, we show that HAMLET successfully transforms a\nstate-of-the-art VLA into a history-aware policy, especially demonstrating\nsignificant improvements on long-horizon tasks that require historical context.\nIn particular, on top of GR00T N1.5, HAMLET achieves an average success rate of\n76.4% on history-dependent real-world tasks, surpassing the baseline\nperformance by 47.2%.

We conduct experiments on five environments, ranging from\nlow-dimensional navigation to manipulation, drone, and quadrupedal locomotion.\nUnder a wide range of STL tasks, TGPO significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art baselines (especially for high-dimensional and long-horizon\ncases), with an average of 31.6% improvement in task success rate compared to\nthe best baseline.

We introduce a\nmethodology that disaggregates a tool-calling task into two distinct subtasks:\ntool selection and argument generation. We propose \"decoupled fine-tuning\", a\nnovel post-training approach that employs LoRA fine-tuning to create dedicated\nLoRA adapters for tool selection and tool-specific argument generation using\nseparate loss masking for each of the subtasks. Furthermore, we present\nDualTune, an inference framework that leverages the LoRA adapters created using\ndecoupled fine-tuning to perform efficient agent orchestration with the help of\nlocal models on end-user devices. DualTune decomposes the tool-call generation\nstep into tool selection and argument generation, and dynamically loads the\ncorresponding LoRA adapters to generate tool calls.

To address these issues, this paper proposes the first Random-to-Target\nFabric Flattening (RTFF) policy, which aligns a random wrinkled fabric state to\nan arbitrary wrinkle-free target state. The proposed policy adopts a hybrid\nImitation Learning-Visual Servoing (IL-VS) framework, where IL learns with\nexplicit fabric models for coarse alignment of the wrinkled fabric toward a\nwrinkle-free state near the target, and VS ensures fine alignment to the\ntarget. Central to this framework is a template-based mesh that offers precise\ntarget state representation, wrinkle-aware geometry prediction, and consistent\nvertex correspondence across RTFF manipulation steps, enabling robust\nmanipulation and seamless IL-VS switching. Leveraging the power of mesh, a\nnovel IL solution for RTFF-Mesh Action Chunking Transformer (MACT)-is then\nproposed by conditioning the mesh information into a Transformer-based policy.\nThe RTFF policy is validated on a real dual-arm tele-operation system, showing\nzero-shot alignment to different targets, high accuracy, and strong\ngeneralization across fabrics and scales.

In the second\nstage, pre-integrated inertial measurement units (IMU) and odometer constraints\nare used to generate predicted double-difference pseudo-range measurements,\nwhich enable a more refined identification and rejection of remaining outliers.\nBy combining these two complementary stages, the system achieves improved\nrobustness against both gross pseudo-range errors and degraded satellite\nmeasuring quality. The experimental results demonstrate that the two-stage\ndetection framework significantly reduces the impact of pseudo-range outliers,\nand leads to improved positioning accuracy and consistency compared with\nrepresentative baseline approaches. In the deep urban canyon test, the outlier\nmitigation method has limits the RMSE of GNSS-RTK/INS/odometer fusion from 0.52\nm to 0.30 m, with 42.3% improvement."}

During\ninference, we sample various time allocations and select the most promising\nassignment for the policy network to rollout the solution trajectory. To foster\nefficient policy learning for complex STL with multiple subgoals, we leverage\nthe learned critic to guide the high-level temporal search via\nMetropolis-Hastings sampling, focusing exploration on temporally feasible\nsolutions. We conduct experiments on five environments, ranging from\nlow-dimensional navigation to manipulation, drone, and quadrupedal locomotion.\nUnder a wide range of STL tasks, TGPO significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art baselines (especially for high-dimensional and long-horizon\ncases), with an average of 31.6% improvement in task success rate compared to\nthe best baseline.

To address these issues, this paper proposes the first Random-to-Target\nFabric Flattening (RTFF) policy, which aligns a random wrinkled fabric state to\nan arbitrary wrinkle-free target state. The proposed policy adopts a hybrid\nImitation Learning-Visual Servoing (IL-VS) framework, where IL learns with\nexplicit fabric models for coarse alignment of the wrinkled fabric toward a\nwrinkle-free state near the target, and VS ensures fine alignment to the\ntarget. Central to this framework is a template-based mesh that offers precise\ntarget state representation, wrinkle-aware geometry prediction, and consistent\nvertex correspondence across RTFF manipulation steps, enabling robust\nmanipulation and seamless IL-VS switching. Leveraging the power of mesh, a\nnovel IL solution for RTFF-Mesh Action Chunking Transformer (MACT)-is then\nproposed by conditioning the mesh information into a Transformer-based policy.\nThe RTFF policy is validated on a real dual-arm tele-operation system, showing\nzero-shot alignment to different targets, high accuracy, and strong\ngeneralization across fabrics and scales.

However, a building's predicted\nflexibility potential is based on uncertain ambient weather forecasts and a\ntypically inaccurate building thermal model. Hence, this paper presents an\nuncertainty-aware flexibility quantifier using a chance-constrained\nformulation. Because such a quantifier may be conservative, we additionally\nmodel real-time feedback in the quantification, in the form of affine feedback\npolicies. Such adaptation can take the form of intra-day trades or rebound\naround the flexibility provision period. To assess the flexibility\nquantification formulations, we further assume that flexible buildings\nparticipate in secondary frequency control markets. The results show some\nincrease in flexibility and revenues when introducing affine feedback policies.\nAdditionally, it is demonstrated that accounting for uncertainties in the\nflexibility quantification is necessary, especially when intra-day trades are\nnot available. Even though an uncertainty-ignorant potential may seem\nfinancially profitable in secondary frequency control markets, it comes at the\ncost of significant thermal discomfort for inhabitants.

A\nGr\\\"onwall-type bound is then used to show that this single-step improvement\npropagates through entire generation trajectories, leading to systemic\nperformance gains. Second, motivated by these results, we propose General\nPolicy Composition (GPC), a training-free method that enhances performance by\ncombining the distributional scores of multiple pre-trained policies via a\nconvex combination and test-time search. GPC is versatile, allowing for the\nplug-and-play composition of heterogeneous policies, including VA and VLA\nmodels, as well as those based on diffusion or flow-matching, irrespective of\ntheir input visual modalities.

The first layer formulates the Order-Line allocation\nas a Constraint Programming (CP) problem, generating high-utilization\nproduction schedules that respect machine capacities, processing times, and due\ndates. The second layer models Worker-Line allocation as a Markov Decision\nProcess (MDP), integrating human factors such as worker preference, experience,\nresilience, and medical constraints into the assignment process. Three solution\nstrategies, greedy allocation, MCTS, and RL, are implemented and compared\nacross multiple evaluation scenarios. The proposed system is validated through\n16 test sessions with domain experts from the automotive industry, combining\nquantitative key performance indicators (KPIs) with expert ratings. Results\nindicate that the CP-based scheduling approach produces compact, feasible\nproduction plans with low tardiness, while the MDP-based worker allocation\nsignificantly improves fairness and preference alignment compared to baseline\napproaches. Domain experts rated both the Order-Line and Worker-Line components\nas effective and highlighted opportunities to further refine the objective\nfunction to penalize excessive earliness and improve continuity in worker\nassignments. Overall, the findings demonstrate that combining CP with\nlearning-based decision-making provides a robust approach for human-centric\nproduction planning. The approach enables simultaneous optimization of\nthroughput and workforce well-being, offering a practical foundation for fair\nand efficient manufacturing scheduling in industrial settings."}

Traditional Lyapunov\ntracking functions are required to decrease monotonically, but systematic\nsynthesis methods for such functions exist only for fully-actuated systems. To\novercome this limitation, we introduce Recurrent Tracking Functions (RTFs),\nwhich replace the monotonic decay requirement with a weaker finite-time\nrecurrence condition.

By augmenting CBFs for RoMs with RTFs, we\nconstruct recurrent CBFs (RCBFs) whose zero-superlevel set is control\n$\\tau$-recurrent, and guarantee safety for all initial states in such a set\nwhen RTFs are satisfied.
