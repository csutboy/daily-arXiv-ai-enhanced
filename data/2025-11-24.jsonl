A new design technique based on a Goldberg discretization and unit cell scaling technique is introduced to accommodate the curved profile of the FSS. The FSS is additively manufactured by sequentially printing dielectric layers and metallic patterns until 3 patterned silver-ink surfaces are integrated within a 4.5 mm (${λ_0}/6$ at 10 GHz) thick ABS hemispherical radome. The diameter and the height of the realized hemispherical FSS are around $5{λ_0}$ and $3{λ_0}$ respectively. Measurements demonstrate a roughly 1.7 dB insertion loss in the passband and 15-20 dB rejection in the stop-band. Additionally, a new postprocessing technique is used to suppress the effects of edge diffraction in the measured transmission spectrum. The design process, manufacturing technique, and measurement postprocessing represent novel advancements enabling future conformal frequency selective surfaces."}

While previous research demonstrated the effects of meteorological and technical variables on PR, a gap persists in the literature on which variables strongly influence PR in large-scale, real-world, heterogeneous PV systems. This paper aims to fill this gap, applying data-driven models to PV systems located in Rondônia State, Brazil, to identify which variables strongly influence annual PR, and, hence, should be the target for optimization. Surprisingly, only negligible effects were found between meteorological and technical variables on annual PR, indicating that human-factors (such as installation, monitoring, and maintenance quality) might have a stronger effect. These findings indicates that, to improve performance of PV systems, policy makers could focus on creating educational programs to teach PV installers and technicians how to properly install, monitor, and maintain modern PV systems. Through estimating the probability density functions of PR, its peak value was found as 78.85% (mean 77.52%, 95% confidence interval of 76.12% to 78.84%, and 95% prediction interval of 58.83% to 92.70%). A map of annual final yield was developed for Rondônia State and can be used by entrepreneurs to quickly and cheaply estimate energy production."}

Jingzehua Xu, Weiyi Liu and Weihang Zhang are co-first authors of this paper, with Zhuofan Xi as the second author", "summary": "Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are indispensable for marine exploration; yet, their control is hindered by nonlinear hydrodynamics, time-varying disturbances, and localization uncertainty. Traditional controllers provide only limited adaptability, while Reinforcement Learning (RL), though promising, suffers from sample inefficiency, weak long-term planning, and lacks stability guarantees, leading to unreliable behavior. To address these challenges, we propose a diffusion-prior Lyapunov actor-critic framework that unifies exploration, stability, and semantic adaptability. Specifically, a diffusion model generates smooth, multimodal, and disturbance-resilient candidate actions; a Lyapunov critic further imposes dual constraints that ensure stability; and a Large Language Model (LLM)-driven outer loop adaptively selects and refines Lyapunov functions based on task semantics and training feedback. This \"generation-filtering-optimization\" mechanism not only enhances sample efficiency and planning capability but also aligns stability guarantees with diverse mission requirements in the multi-objective optimization task. Extensive simulations under complex ocean dynamics demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves more accurate trajectory tracking, higher task completion rates, improved energy efficiency, faster convergence, and improved robustness compared with conventional RL and diffusion-augmented baselines."}

We present a novel Bayesian fractional posterior framework that fuses seismic waves, crater dimensions, synthetic aperture radar imagery, and vision-language model interpreted ground-level images to estimate the yield of the 2020 Beirut explosion. Unlike conventional approaches that may treat data sources equally, our method learns trust weights for each modality through a Dirichlet prior, automatically calibrating the relative information content of disparate observations. Applied to the Beirut explosion, the framework yields an estimate of 0.34--0.48 kt TNT equivalent, representing 12 to 17 percent detonation efficiency relative to the 2.75 kt theoretical maximum from the blast's stored ammonium nitrate. The fractional posterior approach demonstrates superior uncertainty quantification compared to single-modality estimates while providing robustness against systematic biases. This work establishes a principled framework for integrating qualitative assessments with quantitative physical measurements, with applications to explosion monitoring, disaster response, and forensic analysis."}

Early commentators, however, have also articulated concerns about how GenAI usage comes with enormous environmental costs, serious social risks, and a tendency to produce low-quality content. In the midst of both excitement and skepticism, it is crucial to take stock of how GenAI is actually being used. Our study focuses on sociological research as our site, and here we present findings from a survey of 433 authors of articles published in 50 sociology journals in the last five years. The survey provides an overview of the state of the discipline with regard to the use of GenAI by providing answers to fundamental questions: how (much) do scholars use the technology for their research; what are their reasons for using it; and how concerned, trustful, and optimistic are they about the technology? Of the approximately one third ofrespondents who self-report using GenAI at least weekly, the primary uses are for writing assistance and comparatively less so in planning, data collection, or data analysis. In both use and attitudes, there are surprisingly few differences between self-identified computational and non-computational researchers. Generally, respondents are very concerned about the social and environmental consequences of GenAI. Trust in GenAI outputs is low, regardless of expertise or frequency of use. While optimism that GenAI will improve is high, scholars are divided on whether GenAI will have a positive impact on the field."}

Drawing on theories from social cognition and the stereotype content model in Social Psychology, we analyze how English speakers talk about vaccines on social media to understand the evolving narrative around vaccines in social media posts. To do that, we first introduce a novel dataset comprising 18.7 million curated posts on vaccine discourse from 2013 to 2022. This extensive collection-filtered down from an initial 129 million posts through rigorous preprocessing-captures both pre-COVID and COVID-19 periods, offering valuable insights into the evolution of English-speaking X users' perceptions related to vaccines. Our analysis shows that the COVID-19 pandemic led to complex shifts in X users' sentiment and discourse around vaccines. We observe that negative emotion word usage decreased during the pandemic, with notable rises in usage of surprise, and trust related emotion words. Furthermore, vaccine-related language tended to use more warmth-focused words associated with trustworthiness, along with positive, competence-focused words during the early days of the pandemic, with a marked rise in negative word usage towards the end of the pandemic, possibly reflecting a growing vaccine hesitancy and skepticism."}

This study compared image generation in human participants (Visual Artists and Non Artists) and using an image generation AI model (two prompting conditions with varying human input: high for Human Inspired, low for Self Guided). Human raters (N=255) and GPT4o evaluated the creativity of the resulting images. We found a clear creativity gradient, with Visual Artists being the most creative, followed by Non Artists, then Human Inspired generative AI, and finally Self Guided generative AI. Increased human guidance strongly improved GenAI's creative output, bringing its productions close to those of Non Artists. Notably, human and AI raters also showed vastly different creativity judgment patterns. These results suggest that, in contrast to language centered tasks, GenAI models may face unique challenges in visual domains, where creativity depends on perceptual nuance and contextual sensitivity, distinctly human capacities that may not be readily transferable from language models."}

Existing damping strategies based on power modulation of high voltage DC (HVDC) or energy storage, are often limited by fixed control architectures, leaving some modes poorly damped. This paper introduces a state-derivative feedback (SDF) damping controller that uses both frequency and its rate of change as feedback signals. Incorporating state derivatives enhances modal damping and accelerates frequency recovery, enabling HVDC and energy storage to effectively stabilize the grid. We evaluate the SDF controller on two- and three-area systems and compare performance with a frequency difference-based damping scheme. Results show that the SDF control reproduces state-feedback performance while providing good damping of both inter- and intra-area oscillations compared to the frequency-difference method, highlighting its potential as a practical solution for stabilizing power-electronics-rich grids."}

Such agent systems are commonly referred to as \"AI Scientists.\" However, existing AI Scientists predominantly formulate scientific discovery as a standalone search or optimization problem, overlooking the fact that scientific research is inherently a social and collaborative endeavor. Real-world science relies on a complex scientific infrastructure composed of collaborative mechanisms, contribution attribution, peer review, and structured scientific knowledge networks. Due to the lack of modeling for these critical dimensions, current systems struggle to establish a genuine research ecosystem or interact deeply with the human scientific community.

We introduce a methodological framework that models user adaptation through a conformity index, capturing conformist, anti-conformist, and independent behavioral tendencies. Our findings show that most users tend to conform to local normative environments, adjusting their toxicity to match the toxicity levels of the chats in which they participate. These patterns are consistent across datasets and languages, suggesting that community norms and social influence play a decisive role in shaping user behavior online. Furthermore, we demonstrate that exposure to these norms, in terms of increased user participation in chats, is associated with a stronger tendency toward conformity with the surrounding social contexts.

Here, we introduce Single-Pixel Tactile Skin (SPTS), a paradigm that uses compressive sampling to reconstruct rich tactile information from an entire sensor array via a single output channel. This is achieved through a direct circuit-level implementation where each sensing element, equipped with a miniature microcontroller, contributes a dynamically weighted analog signal to a global sum, performing distributed compressed sensing in hardware. Our flexible, daisy-chainable design simplifies wiring to a few input lines and one output, and significantly reduces measurement requirements compared to raster scanning methods. We demonstrate the system's performance by achieving object classification at an effective 3500 FPS and by capturing transient dynamics, resolving an 8 ms projectile impact into 23 frames. A key feature is the support for adaptive reconstruction, where sensing fidelity scales with measurement time. This allows for rapid contact localization using as little as 7% of total data, followed by progressive refinement to a high-fidelity image - a capability critical for responsive robotic systems. This work offers an efficient pathway towards large-scale tactile intelligence for robotics and human-machine interfaces."}

This study compared image generation in human participants (Visual Artists and Non Artists) and using an image generation AI model (two prompting conditions with varying human input: high for Human Inspired, low for Self Guided). Human raters (N=255) and GPT4o evaluated the creativity of the resulting images. We found a clear creativity gradient, with Visual Artists being the most creative, followed by Non Artists, then Human Inspired generative AI, and finally Self Guided generative AI. Increased human guidance strongly improved GenAI's creative output, bringing its productions close to those of Non Artists. Notably, human and AI raters also showed vastly different creativity judgment patterns. These results suggest that, in contrast to language centered tasks, GenAI models may face unique challenges in visual domains, where creativity depends on perceptual nuance and contextual sensitivity, distinctly human capacities that may not be readily transferable from language models."}

However, under packet-based communication protocols, any error typically results in the loss of an entire packet, making semantic communication particularly vulnerable to packet loss. Since high-dimensional semantic features must be partitioned into one-dimensional transmission units during packetization. A critical open question is how to partition semantic features to maximize robustness. To address this, we systematically investigate the performance of two mainstream architectures, Transformer and Convolutional neural networks (CNN), under various feature partitioning schemes. The results show that the Transformer architecture exhibits inherent robustness to packet loss when partitioned along the channel dimension. In contrast, the CNN-based baseline exhibits imbalanced channel utilization, causing severe degradation once dominant channels are lost. To enhance the CNN resilience, we propose a lightweight Semantic Equalization Mechanism (SEM) that balances channel contributions and prevents a few channels from dominating. SEM consists of two parallel approaches: a Dynamic Scale module that adaptively adjusts channel importance, and a Broadcast module that facilitates information interaction among channels. Experimental results demonstrate that CNN equipped with SEM achieve graceful degradation under packet loss (retaining about 85% of lossless PSNR at 40% packet loss), comparable to that of Transformer models. Our findings indicate that, under an appropriate partitioning strategy, maintaining a balanced semantic representation is a fundamental condition for achieving intrinsic robustness against packet loss. These insights may also extend to other modalities such as video and support practical semantic communication design."}

We study emergency triage, validating the approach on more than 150,000 admissions to the Bordeaux University Hospital (France) and replicating results on a subset of MIMIC-IV across a different language, population, and healthcare system. In the Bordeaux cohort, otherwise identical presentations were approximately 2.1% more likely to receive a lower-severity triage score when presented as female rather than male; scaled to national emergency volumes in France, this corresponds to more than 200,000 lower-severity assignments per year. Modality-specific analyses indicate that both explicit tabular gender indicators and implicit textual gender cues contribute to the disparity. Beyond emergency care, the approach supports bias audits in other settings (e.g., hiring, academic, and justice decisions), providing a scalable tool to detect and address inequities in real-world decision-making."}

Surprisingly, only negligible effects were found between meteorological and technical variables on annual PR, indicating that human-factors (such as installation, monitoring, and maintenance quality) might have a stronger effect. These findings indicates that, to improve performance of PV systems, policy makers could focus on creating educational programs to teach PV installers and technicians how to properly install, monitor, and maintain modern PV systems. Through estimating the probability density functions of PR, its peak value was found as 78.85% (mean 77.52%, 95% confidence interval of 76.12% to 78.84%, and 95% prediction interval of 58.83% to 92.70%).

Our approach builds on a core assumption commonly used in AI evaluations that the mean score sufficiently summarizes model performance. This implies a unidimensional latent construct underlying the measurement experiment, yielding expected ranges for various statistics for each item.

Dynamic, continuously adaptable resilience is required to ensure their functionality under variable conditions. However, existing resilience architectures usually only deal with adaptation implicitly and thus remain predominantly static. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a new Adaptive Coordination Layer (ACL) and conceptually redefining the Adaptation & Learning Layer (AL). The ACL acts as an operational control layer that detects risks in real time, prioritises countermeasures and coordinates them dynamically. The AL is reinterpreted as a strategic-cooperative layer that evaluates the operational decisions of the ACL, learns from them, and derives long-term adjustments at the policy, governance, and architecture levels. Together, both layers operationalise the resilience principle of adaptation and combine short-term responsiveness with long-term learning and development capabilities. The paper describes various implementation variants of both levels - from rule-based and KPI-driven approaches to AI-supported and meta-learning mechanisms - and shows how these can be combined depending on system complexity, data availability and degree of regulation. The proposed architecture model no longer understands resilience as a static system property, but as a continuous, data-driven process of mutual coordination and systemic learning. This creates a methodological basis for the next generation of adaptive and resilient CPSoS."}

Objectives: We aimed to quantify the effects of extreme maximum temperatures and heatwaves on daily mortality in Catalonia (2012--2022), and to assess the modifying and confounding roles of air pollutants and socioeconomic factors. Methods: We conducted a time--series ecological study across 379 basic health areas (ABS) during summer months. Mortality data from the Spanish National Statistics Institute were linked with meteorological and air pollution data. A hierarchical Bayesian spatiotemporal model, incorporating structured and unstructured random effects, was used to account for spatial and temporal dependencies, as well as observed socioeconomic confounders. Results: In total, 730,634 deaths occurred, with 216,989 in summer. Extreme heat alone was not independently associated with mortality, as its effect was fully confounded by high ozone levels and partly by socioeconomic indicators. Ozone concentrations ($\\ge 120 μg/m^3$) significantly increased mortality risk, especially among individuals aged $\\ge 85$ years. Greater income inequality and higher proportions of older residents also amplified vulnerability. Conclusion: Mortality risks from extreme heat in Catalonia were strongly influenced by ozone levels and social determinants. Adaptation strategies should address both compound environmental exposures together with socioeconomic vulnerability to better protect older and disadvantaged populations."}

While prior studies have predominantly focused on the energy-intensive nature of the training phase, the cumulative environmental footprint generated during large-scale service operations, particularly in the inference phase, has received comparatively less attention. To bridge this gap this study conducts a scoping review of methodologies and research trends in AI carbon footprint assessment. We analyze the classification and standardization status of existing AI carbon measurement tools and methodologies, and comparatively examine the environmental impacts arising from both training and inference stages. In addition, we identify how multidimensional factors such as model size, prompt complexity, serving environments, and system boundary definitions shape the resulting carbon footprint. Our review reveals critical limitations in current AI carbon accounting practices, including methodological inconsistencies, technology-specific biases, and insufficient attention to end-to-end system perspectives. Building on these insights, we propose future research and governance directions: (1) establishing standardized and transparent universal measurement protocols, (2) designing dynamic evaluation frameworks that incorporate user behavior, (3) developing life-cycle monitoring systems that encompass embodied emissions, and (4) advancing multidimensional sustainability assessment framework that balance model performance with environmental efficiency. This paper provides a foundation for interdisciplinary dialogue aimed at building a sustainable AI ecosystem and offers a baseline guideline for researchers seeking to understand the environmental implications of AI across technical, social, and operational dimensions."}

Jingzehua Xu, Weiyi Liu and Weihang Zhang are co-first authors of this paper, with Zhuofan Xi as the second author", "summary": "Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are indispensable for marine exploration; yet, their control is hindered by nonlinear hydrodynamics, time-varying disturbances, and localization uncertainty. Traditional controllers provide only limited adaptability, while Reinforcement Learning (RL), though promising, suffers from sample inefficiency, weak long-term planning, and lacks stability guarantees, leading to unreliable behavior. To address these challenges, we propose a diffusion-prior Lyapunov actor-critic framework that unifies exploration, stability, and semantic adaptability. Specifically, a diffusion model generates smooth, multimodal, and disturbance-resilient candidate actions; a Lyapunov critic further imposes dual constraints that ensure stability; and a Large Language Model (LLM)-driven outer loop adaptively selects and refines Lyapunov functions based on task semantics and training feedback. This \"generation-filtering-optimization\" mechanism not only enhances sample efficiency and planning capability but also aligns stability guarantees with diverse mission requirements in the multi-objective optimization task. Extensive simulations under complex ocean dynamics demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves more accurate trajectory tracking, higher task completion rates, improved energy efficiency, faster convergence, and improved robustness compared with conventional RL and diffusion-augmented baselines."}

This phenomenon results in a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for policy gradients, significantly hindering algorithm convergence and performance improvement. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel Hybrid Differential Reward (HDR) mechanism. We first theoretically elucidate how the temporal quasi-steady nature of traffic states and the physical proximity of actions lead to the failure of traditional reward signals. Building on this analysis, the HDR framework innovatively integrates two complementary components: (1) a Temporal Difference Reward (TRD) based on a global potential function, which utilizes the evolutionary trend of potential energy to ensure optimal policy invariance and consistency with long-term objectives; and (2) an Action Gradient Reward (ARG), which directly measures the marginal utility of actions to provide a local guidance signal with a high SNR. Furthermore, we formulate the cooperative driving problem as a Multi-Agent Partially Observable Markov Game (POMDPG) with a time-varying agent set and provide a complete instantiation scheme for HDR within this framework. Extensive experiments conducted using both online planning (MCTS) and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (QMIX, MAPPO, MADDPG) algorithms demonstrate that the HDR mechanism significantly improves convergence speed and policy stability. The results confirm that HDR guides agents to learn high-quality cooperative policies that effectively balance traffic efficiency and safety."}

Drawing on theories from social cognition and the stereotype content model in Social Psychology, we analyze how English speakers talk about vaccines on social media to understand the evolving narrative around vaccines in social media posts. To do that, we first introduce a novel dataset comprising 18.7 million curated posts on vaccine discourse from 2013 to 2022. This extensive collection-filtered down from an initial 129 million posts through rigorous preprocessing-captures both pre-COVID and COVID-19 periods, offering valuable insights into the evolution of English-speaking X users' perceptions related to vaccines. Our analysis shows that the COVID-19 pandemic led to complex shifts in X users' sentiment and discourse around vaccines. We observe that negative emotion word usage decreased during the pandemic, with notable rises in usage of surprise, and trust related emotion words. Furthermore, vaccine-related language tended to use more warmth-focused words associated with trustworthiness, along with positive, competence-focused words during the early days of the pandemic, with a marked rise in negative word usage towards the end of the pandemic, possibly reflecting a growing vaccine hesitancy and skepticism."}

This article uses a calibrated agent-based model to examine how alternative progression regimes reconfigure dropout, time-to-degree, equity and students' psychological experience in a long, tightly sequenced engineering programme. Building on a leakage-aware longitudinal dataset of 1,343 students and a Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of time-to-dropout, we simulate three policy scenarios: (A) a historical \"regularity + finals\" regime, where students accumulate exam debt; (B) a direct-promotion regime that removes regularity and finals but requires full course completion each term; and (C) a direct-promotion regime complemented by a capacity-limited remedial \"safety net\" for marginal failures in bottleneck courses. The model is empirically calibrated to reproduce the observed dropout curve under Scenario A and then used to explore counterfactuals. Results show that direct promotion creates a \"promotion wall\": attrition becomes sharply front-loaded in the first two years, overall dropout rises, and equity gaps between low- and high-resilience students widen, even as exam debt disappears. The safety-net scenario partially dismantles this wall: it reduces dropout and equity gaps relative to pure direct promotion and yields the lowest final stress levels, at the cost of additional, targeted teaching capacity. These findings position progression rules as central objects of assessment policy rather than neutral background. The article argues that claims of improved efficiency are incomplete unless they are evaluated jointly with inclusion, equity and students' psychological wellbeing, and it illustrates how simulation-based decision support can help institutions rehearse assessment reforms before implementing them."}

Incorporating state derivatives enhances modal damping and accelerates frequency recovery, enabling HVDC and energy storage to effectively stabilize the grid. We evaluate the SDF controller on two- and three-area systems and compare performance with a frequency difference-based damping scheme. Results show that the SDF control reproduces state-feedback performance while providing good damping of both inter- and intra-area oscillations compared to the frequency-difference method, highlighting its potential as a practical solution for stabilizing power-electronics-rich grids."}

Recent work indicates that the use of robot-to-camera transformation information ({\\ie}, camera extrinsics) benefits the learning process and produces better results. However, camera extrinsics are oftentimes unavailable and estimation methods usually suffer from local minima and poor generalizations. In this paper, we present CalibAll, a simple yet effective method that \\textbf{requires only a single mark} and performs training-free, stable, and accurate camera extrinsic estimation across diverse robots and datasets through a coarse-to-fine calibration pipeline. In particular, we annotate a single mark on an end-effector (EEF), and leverage the correspondence ability emerged from vision foundation models (VFM) to automatically localize the corresponding mark across robots in diverse datasets. Using this mark, together with point tracking and the 3D EEF trajectory, we obtain a coarse camera extrinsic via temporal Perspective-n-Point (PnP). This estimate is further refined through a rendering-based optimization that aligns rendered and ground-true masks, yielding accurate and stable camera extrinsic. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, showing strong robustness and general effectiveness across three robot platforms. It also produces useful auxiliary annotations such as depth maps, link-wise masks, and end-effector 2D trajectories, which can further support downstream tasks."}

While previous research demonstrated the effects of meteorological and technical variables on PR, a gap persists in the literature on which variables strongly influence PR in large-scale, real-world, heterogeneous PV systems. This paper aims to fill this gap, applying data-driven models to PV systems located in Rondônia State, Brazil, to identify which variables strongly influence annual PR, and, hence, should be the target for optimization. Surprisingly, only negligible effects were found between meteorological and technical variables on annual PR, indicating that human-factors (such as installation, monitoring, and maintenance quality) might have a stronger effect. These findings indicates that, to improve performance of PV systems, policy makers could focus on creating educational programs to teach PV installers and technicians how to properly install, monitor, and maintain modern PV systems. Through estimating the probability density functions of PR, its peak value was found as 78.85% (mean 77.52%, 95% confidence interval of 76.12% to 78.84%, and 95% prediction interval of 58.83% to 92.70%). A map of annual final yield was developed for Rondônia State and can be used by entrepreneurs to quickly and cheaply estimate energy production."}

However, under packet-based communication protocols, any error typically results in the loss of an entire packet, making semantic communication particularly vulnerable to packet loss. Since high-dimensional semantic features must be partitioned into one-dimensional transmission units during packetization. A critical open question is how to partition semantic features to maximize robustness. To address this, we systematically investigate the performance of two mainstream architectures, Transformer and Convolutional neural networks (CNN), under various feature partitioning schemes. The results show that the Transformer architecture exhibits inherent robustness to packet loss when partitioned along the channel dimension. In contrast, the CNN-based baseline exhibits imbalanced channel utilization, causing severe degradation once dominant channels are lost. To enhance the CNN resilience, we propose a lightweight Semantic Equalization Mechanism (SEM) that balances channel contributions and prevents a few channels from dominating. SEM consists of two parallel approaches: a Dynamic Scale module that adaptively adjusts channel importance, and a Broadcast module that facilitates information interaction among channels. Experimental results demonstrate that CNN equipped with SEM achieve graceful degradation under packet loss (retaining about 85% of lossless PSNR at 40% packet loss), comparable to that of Transformer models. Our findings indicate that, under an appropriate partitioning strategy, maintaining a balanced semantic representation is a fundamental condition for achieving intrinsic robustness against packet loss. These insights may also extend to other modalities such as video and support practical semantic communication design."}

Model-based and learning-based methods often fail in highly dynamic scenarios because traditional methods assume a static environment and cannot adapt to real-time changes, while learning-based methods rely on single-frame observations for motion constraint estimation, limiting their adaptability. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a novel framework that leverages multi-frame point constraints, including current and future frames predicted by a dedicated module, to enable proactive end-to-end navigation. By incorporating a prediction module that forecasts the future path of moving obstacles based on multi-frame observations, our method allows the robot to proactively anticipate and avoid potential dangers. This proactive planning capability significantly enhances navigation robustness and efficiency in unknown dynamic environments.

However, current approaches largely conceptualize scientific discovery as a solitary optimization or search process, overlooking that knowledge production is inherently a social and historical endeavor. Human scientific insight stems from two distinct yet interconnected sources. First is the individual cognitive trajectory, where a researcher's unique insight is shaped by their evolving research history and stylistic preferences; another is the collective disciplinary memory, where knowledge is sedimented into vast, interconnected networks of citations and concepts. Existing LLMs still struggle to represent these structured, high-fidelity cognitive and social contexts. To bridge this gap, we introduce MirrorMind, a hierarchical cognitive architecture that integrates dual-memory representations within a three-level framework. The Individual Level constructs high-fidelity cognitive models of individual researchers by capturing their episodic, semantic, and persona memories; the Domain Level maps collective knowledge into structured disciplinary concept graphs; and the Interdisciplinary Level that acts as an orthogonal orchestration engine. Crucially, our architecture separates memory storage from agentic execution, enabling AI scientist agents to flexibly access individual memories for unique perspectives or collective structures to reason. We evaluate MirrorMind across four comprehensive tasks, including author-level cognitive simulation, complementary reasoning, cross-disciplinary collaboration promotion, and multi-agent scientific problem solving. The results show that by integrating individual cognitive depth with collective disciplinary breadth, MirrorMind moves beyond simple fact retrieval toward structural, personalized, and insight-generating scientific reasoning."}

Building on recent work that explores how AI companies engage in geopolitics, this position paper argues that some AI workers can be considered actors of geopolitics. It makes the timely case that governance alone cannot ensure responsible, ethical, or robust AI development and use, and greater attention should be paid to bottom-up interventions at the site of AI development.

Dynamic, continuously adaptable resilience is required to ensure their functionality under variable conditions. However, existing resilience architectures usually only deal with adaptation implicitly and thus remain predominantly static. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a new Adaptive Coordination Layer (ACL) and conceptually redefining the Adaptation & Learning Layer (AL). The ACL acts as an operational control layer that detects risks in real time, prioritises countermeasures and coordinates them dynamically. The AL is reinterpreted as a strategic-cooperative layer that evaluates the operational decisions of the ACL, learns from them, and derives long-term adjustments at the policy, governance, and architecture levels. Together, both layers operationalise the resilience principle of adaptation and combine short-term responsiveness with long-term learning and development capabilities. The paper describes various implementation variants of both levels - from rule-based and KPI-driven approaches to AI-supported and meta-learning mechanisms - and shows how these can be combined depending on system complexity, data availability and degree of regulation. The proposed architecture model no longer understands resilience as a static system property, but as a continuous, data-driven process of mutual coordination and systemic learning. This creates a methodological basis for the next generation of adaptive and resilient CPSoS."}

However, most existing approaches treat observation and action generation in a monolithic and goal-agnostic manner, often leading to semantically misaligned predictions and incoherent behaviors. To this end, we propose H-GAR, a Hierarchical interaction framework via Goal-driven observation-Action Refinement.To anchor prediction to the task objective, H-GAR first produces a goal observation and a coarse action sketch that outline a high-level route toward the goal. To enable explicit interaction between observation and action under the guidance of the goal observation for more coherent decision-making, we devise two synergistic modules. (1) Goal-Conditioned Observation Synthesizer (GOS) synthesizes intermediate observations based on the coarse-grained actions and the predicted goal observation. (2) Interaction-Aware Action Refiner (IAAR) refines coarse actions into fine-grained, goal-consistent actions by leveraging feedback from the intermediate observations and a Historical Action Memory Bank that encodes prior actions to ensure temporal consistency. By integrating goal grounding with explicit action-observation interaction in a coarse-to-fine manner, H-GAR enables more accurate manipulation. Extensive experiments on both simulation and real-world robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate that H-GAR achieves state-of-the-art performance."}

For these agents, scaling involves not only \"thinking\" in tokens but also \"acting\" via tool calls. The number of tool calls directly bounds the agent's interaction with the external environment. However, we find that simply granting agents a larger tool-call budget fails to improve performance, as they lack \"budget awareness\" and quickly hit a performance ceiling. To address this, we study how to scale such agents effectively under explicit tool-call budgets, focusing on web search agents. We first introduce the Budget Tracker, a lightweight plug-in that provides the agent with continuous budget awareness, enabling simple yet effective scaling. We further develop BATS (Budget Aware Test-time Scaling), an advanced framework that leverages this awareness to dynamically adapt its planning and verification strategy, deciding whether to \"dig deeper\" on a promising lead or \"pivot\" to new paths based on remaining resources. To analyze cost-performance scaling in a controlled manner, we formalize a unified cost metric that jointly accounts for token and tool consumption. We provide the first systematic study on budget-constrained agents, showing that budget-aware methods produce more favorable scaling curves and push the cost-performance Pareto frontier.

Our approach builds on a core assumption commonly used in AI evaluations that the mean score sufficiently summarizes model performance.

Building on this insight, Progress-Think introduces semantic progress reasoning, predicting instruction-style progress from visual observations to enable more accurate navigation. To achieve this without expensive annotations, we propose a three-stage framework. In the initial stage, Self-Aligned Progress Pretraining bootstraps a reasoning module via a novel differentiable alignment between visual history and instruction prefixes.

To clarify this structure, we reinterpret the role of diffusion in inverse problem solving as an initialization stage within an expectation--maximization (EM)--style framework, where the diffusion stage and the data-driven refinement are fully decoupled. We introduce \\textbf{DAPS++}, which allows the likelihood term to guide inference more directly while maintaining numerical stability and providing insight into why unified diffusion trajectories remain effective in practice.

Massive MIMO transmission enables beamforming, beam steering, and spatial multiplexing across multiple transmission layers, with the number of simultaneous transmission paths depending on the rank of the radio channel, further named 'transmission rank'. Since the total transmission power of a base station is shared among these layers, rank variations affect the measured exposure levels, e.g., when assessments use provoked traffic via user equipment. This study investigates the impact of the transmission rank on the measured maximum exposure in the 3.6 GHz (n78) band of a German 5G network employing massive MIMO technology. Field measurements were performed using a spectrum analyzer with isotropic probe, to capture maximum field strengths under full-load traffic conditions. The transmission rank was manipulated by artificially degrading the reception quality of the user equipment with a shielding bag, forcing a single transmission layer (rank-1). The results were compared with unshielded operation allowing up to the maximum number of four independent transmission layers (rank-4). The data reveal exposure differences ranging from 1.7 dB to 5.4 dB, with a median of 4.3 dB at the measurement points studied.

We validated the approach in both indoor and outdoor experiments, demonstrating that the proposed reflection-based localization system operates reliably without prior knowledge of team member size and achieves greater effective range (above 30 m) and accuracy than state-of-the-art methods.

To leverage the potential of such systems in high-risk applications, we need large, structured tabular datasets on which we can build transparent feature-based models. While part of the EHR already contains structured information (e.g. diagnosis codes, medications, and lab results), much of the information is contained within unstructured text (e.g. discharge summaries and nursing notes). In this work, we propose a method for multi-modal patient-level information extraction that leverages both the tabular features available in the patient's EHR (using an expert-informed Bayesian network) as well as clinical notes describing the patient's symptoms (using neural text classifiers). We propose the use of virtual evidence augmented with a consistency node to provide an interpretable, probabilistic fusion of the models' predictions. The consistency node improves the calibration of the final predictions compared to virtual evidence alone, allowing the Bayesian network to better adjust the neural classifier's output to handle missing information and resolve contradictions between the tabular and text data. We show the potential of our method on the SimSUM dataset, a simulated benchmark linking tabular EHRs with clinical notes through expert knowledge."}

Early commentators, however, have also articulated concerns about how GenAI usage comes with enormous environmental costs, serious social risks, and a tendency to produce low-quality content. In the midst of both excitement and skepticism, it is crucial to take stock of how GenAI is actually being used. Our study focuses on sociological research as our site, and here we present findings from a survey of 433 authors of articles published in 50 sociology journals in the last five years. The survey provides an overview of the state of the discipline with regard to the use of GenAI by providing answers to fundamental questions: how (much) do scholars use the technology for their research; what are their reasons for using it; and how concerned, trustful, and optimistic are they about the technology? Of the approximately one third ofrespondents who self-report using GenAI at least weekly, the primary uses are for writing assistance and comparatively less so in planning, data collection, or data analysis. In both use and attitudes, there are surprisingly few differences between self-identified computational and non-computational researchers. Generally, respondents are very concerned about the social and environmental consequences of GenAI. Trust in GenAI outputs is low, regardless of expertise or frequency of use. While optimism that GenAI will improve is high, scholars are divided on whether GenAI will have a positive impact on the field."}

In this study, we propose a method to enhance the efficiency of robot body design based on black-box optimization by utilizing large language models (LLMs). In parallel with the sampling process based on black-box optimization, sampling is performed using LLMs, which are provided with problem settings and extensive feedback. We demonstrate that this method enables more efficient exploration of design solutions and discuss its characteristics and limitations."}

Here, we introduce Single-Pixel Tactile Skin (SPTS), a paradigm that uses compressive sampling to reconstruct rich tactile information from an entire sensor array via a single output channel. This is achieved through a direct circuit-level implementation where each sensing element, equipped with a miniature microcontroller, contributes a dynamically weighted analog signal to a global sum, performing distributed compressed sensing in hardware. Our flexible, daisy-chainable design simplifies wiring to a few input lines and one output, and significantly reduces measurement requirements compared to raster scanning methods. We demonstrate the system's performance by achieving object classification at an effective 3500 FPS and by capturing transient dynamics, resolving an 8 ms projectile impact into 23 frames. A key feature is the support for adaptive reconstruction, where sensing fidelity scales with measurement time. This allows for rapid contact localization using as little as 7% of total data, followed by progressive refinement to a high-fidelity image - a capability critical for responsive robotic systems. This work offers an efficient pathway towards large-scale tactile intelligence for robotics and human-machine interfaces."}

While intrinsic reward methods have demonstrated effectiveness in single-agent rein-forcement learning scenarios, their application to multi-agent reinforcement learn-ing (MARL) remains problematic. The primary difficulties stem from two fac-tors: (1) the exponential sparsity of joint action trajectories that lead to rewards as the exploration space expands, and (2) existing methods often fail to account for joint actions that can influence team states. To address these challenges, this paper introduces Mutual Intrinsic Reward (MIR), a simple yet effective enhancement strategy for MARL with extremely sparse rewards like episodic rewards. MIR incentivizes individual agents to explore actions that affect their teammates, and when combined with original strategies, effectively stimulates team exploration and improves algorithm performance. For comprehensive experimental valida-tion, we extend the representative single-agent MiniGrid environment to create MiniGrid-MA, a series of MARL environments with sparse rewards.

Traditional controllers provide only limited adaptability, while Reinforcement Learning (RL), though promising, suffers from sample inefficiency, weak long-term planning, and lacks stability guarantees, leading to unreliable behavior. To address these challenges, we propose a diffusion-prior Lyapunov actor-critic framework that unifies exploration, stability, and semantic adaptability. Specifically, a diffusion model generates smooth, multimodal, and disturbance-resilient candidate actions; a Lyapunov critic further imposes dual constraints that ensure stability; and a Large Language Model (LLM)-driven outer loop adaptively selects and refines Lyapunov functions based on task semantics and training feedback. This \"generation-filtering-optimization\" mechanism not only enhances sample efficiency and planning capability but also aligns stability guarantees with diverse mission requirements in the multi-objective optimization task. Extensive simulations under complex ocean dynamics demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves more accurate trajectory tracking, higher task completion rates, improved energy efficiency, faster convergence, and improved robustness compared with conventional RL and diffusion-augmented baselines."}

Massive MIMO transmission enables beamforming, beam steering, and spatial multiplexing across multiple transmission layers, with the number of simultaneous transmission paths depending on the rank of the radio channel, further named 'transmission rank'. Since the total transmission power of a base station is shared among these layers, rank variations affect the measured exposure levels, e.g., when assessments use provoked traffic via user equipment. This study investigates the impact of the transmission rank on the measured maximum exposure in the 3.6 GHz (n78) band of a German 5G network employing massive MIMO technology. Field measurements were performed using a spectrum analyzer with isotropic probe, to capture maximum field strengths under full-load traffic conditions. The transmission rank was manipulated by artificially degrading the reception quality of the user equipment with a shielding bag, forcing a single transmission layer (rank-1). The results were compared with unshielded operation allowing up to the maximum number of four independent transmission layers (rank-4). The data reveal exposure differences ranging from 1.7 dB to 5.4 dB, with a median of 4.3 dB at the measurement points studied. These findings highlight the necessity of considering the transmission rank in exposure assessments to electromagnetic fields."}

Fields such as remote sensing, requiring specialized tools (e.g., correction, spectral indices calculation), and multi-step procedures (e.g., numerous intermediate products and optional steps), significantly challenge generalized approaches. To address this gap, we introduce a novel agent design framework centered on a Hierarchical Task Abstraction Mechanism (HTAM). Specifically, HTAM moves beyond emulating social roles, instead structuring multi-agent systems into a logical hierarchy that mirrors the intrinsic task-dependency graph of a given domain. This task-centric architecture thus enforces procedural correctness and decomposes complex problems into sequential layers, where each layer's sub-agents operate on the outputs of the preceding layers. We instantiate this framework as EarthAgent, a multi-agent system tailored for complex geospatial analysis. To evaluate such complex planning capabilities, we build GeoPlan-bench, a comprehensive benchmark of realistic, multi-step geospatial planning tasks. It is accompanied by a suite of carefully designed metrics to evaluate tool selection, path similarity, and logical completeness. Experiments show that EarthAgent substantially outperforms a range of established single- and multi-agent systems. Our work demonstrates that aligning agent architecture with a domain's intrinsic task structure is a critical step toward building robust and reliable specialized autonomous systems."}

This work investigates different mechanical models, which can be used to simulate the net dynamics, simulating various degrees of compliance, and different control strategies to achieve the capture of the debris, depending on the relative position of the net and the target.

The results show that a more compliant net achieves higher performance when attempting the capture of Envisat.

This phenomenon results in a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for policy gradients, significantly hindering algorithm convergence and performance improvement. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel Hybrid Differential Reward (HDR) mechanism. We first theoretically elucidate how the temporal quasi-steady nature of traffic states and the physical proximity of actions lead to the failure of traditional reward signals. Building on this analysis, the HDR framework innovatively integrates two complementary components: (1) a Temporal Difference Reward (TRD) based on a global potential function, which utilizes the evolutionary trend of potential energy to ensure optimal policy invariance and consistency with long-term objectives; and (2) an Action Gradient Reward (ARG), which directly measures the marginal utility of actions to provide a local guidance signal with a high SNR. Furthermore, we formulate the cooperative driving problem as a Multi-Agent Partially Observable Markov Game (POMDPG) with a time-varying agent set and provide a complete instantiation scheme for HDR within this framework. Extensive experiments conducted using both online planning (MCTS) and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (QMIX, MAPPO, MADDPG) algorithms demonstrate that the HDR mechanism significantly improves convergence speed and policy stability. The results confirm that HDR guides agents to learn high-quality cooperative policies that effectively balance traffic efficiency and safety."}

Here, we introduce Single-Pixel Tactile Skin (SPTS), a paradigm that uses compressive sampling to reconstruct rich tactile information from an entire sensor array via a single output channel. This is achieved through a direct circuit-level implementation where each sensing element, equipped with a miniature microcontroller, contributes a dynamically weighted analog signal to a global sum, performing distributed compressed sensing in hardware. Our flexible, daisy-chainable design simplifies wiring to a few input lines and one output, and significantly reduces measurement requirements compared to raster scanning methods. We demonstrate the system's performance by achieving object classification at an effective 3500 FPS and by capturing transient dynamics, resolving an 8 ms projectile impact into 23 frames. A key feature is the support for adaptive reconstruction, where sensing fidelity scales with measurement time. This allows for rapid contact localization using as little as 7% of total data, followed by progressive refinement to a high-fidelity image - a capability critical for responsive robotic systems. This work offers an efficient pathway towards large-scale tactile intelligence for robotics and human-machine interfaces."}

Well-known inverse kinematics (IK) techniques can provide mathematically exact solutions (when they exist) for joint configuration determination based solely on the fingertip pose, but often require post-hoc decision-making by considering the positions of all intermediate phalanges in the gripper's fingers, or rely on algorithms to numerically approximate solutions for more complex kinematics. In contrast, our method leverages machine learning to implicitly overcome these challenges. This is achieved through a Conditional Variational Auto-Encoder (CVAE), which takes point cloud data of key structural elements as input and reconstructs the corresponding joint configurations. We validate our approach on the MultiDex grasping dataset using the Allegro Hand, operating within 0.05 milliseconds and achieving accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art methods.

However, natural examples of many behaviours are rare, forcing researchers to rely on synthetic or off-policy LLM responses for training probes. We systematically evaluate how the use of synthetic and off-policy data influences probe generalisation across eight distinct LLM behaviours. Testing linear and attention probes across multiple LLMs, we find that the response generation strategy can significantly affect probe performance, though the magnitude of this effect varies by behaviour. We find that successful generalisation from off-policy data, to test sets where the model is incentivised to produce the target behaviour, is predictive of successful on-policy generalisation. Leveraging this result, we predict that Deception and Sandbagging probes may fail to generalise from off-policy to on-policy data when used in real monitoring scenarios. Notably, shifts in the training data domain still cause even larger performance degradation, with different-domain test scores being consistently lower than the same-domain ones. These results indicate that, in the absence of on-policy data, using same-domain off-policy data yields more reliable probes than using on-policy data from a different domain, emphasizing the need for methods that can better handle distribution shifts in LLM monitoring."}

Real-world science relies on a complex scientific infrastructure composed of collaborative mechanisms, contribution attribution, peer review, and structured scientific knowledge networks. Due to the lack of modeling for these critical dimensions, current systems struggle to establish a genuine research ecosystem or interact deeply with the human scientific community. To bridge this gap, we introduce OmniScientist, a framework that explicitly encodes the underlying mechanisms of human research into the AI scientific workflow. OmniScientist not only achieves end-to-end automation across data foundation, literature review, research ideation, experiment automation, scientific writing, and peer review, but also provides comprehensive infrastructural support by simulating the human scientific system, comprising: (1) a structured knowledge system built upon citation networks and conceptual correlations; (2) a collaborative research protocol (OSP), which enables seamless multi-agent collaboration and human researcher participation; and (3) an open evaluation platform (ScienceArena) based on blind pairwise user voting and Elo rankings.

The mapping module solves the problems of sparse depth data, free-space gaps, and large depth uncertainty by oversampling free space in texture-sparse areas and keeping track of obstacle position uncertainty. The planning module handles the added free-space uncertainty through rapid replanning and perception-aware heading control. We further show that frontier-based exploration is possible with sparse monocular depth data when parallax requirements and the possibility of textureless surfaces are taken into account. We evaluate our approach extensively in diverse real-world and simulated environments, including ablation studies.

However, existing generic CP approaches need to transmit large volumes of perception data that are irrelevant to the driving safety, exceeding available communication bandwidth. Moreover, most CP frameworks rely on pre-defined communication partners, making them unsuitable for dynamic traffic environments. This paper proposes a Spontaneous Risk-Aware Selective Cooperative Perception (SRA-CP) framework to address these challenges. SRA-CP introduces a decentralized protocol where connected agents continuously broadcast lightweight perception coverage summaries and initiate targeted cooperation only when risk-relevant blind zones are detected. A perceptual risk identification module enables each CV to locally assess the impact of occlusions on its driving task and determine whether cooperation is necessary. When CP is triggered, the ego vehicle selects appropriate peers based on shared perception coverage and engages in selective information exchange through a fusion module that prioritizes safety-critical content and adapts to bandwidth constraints. We evaluate SRA-CP on a public dataset against several representative baselines. Results show that SRA-CP achieves less than 1% average precision (AP) loss for safety-critical objects compared to generic CP, while using only 20% of the communication bandwidth. Moreover, it improves the perception performance by 15% over existing selective CP methods that do not incorporate risk awareness."}

Early commentators, however, have also articulated concerns about how GenAI usage comes with enormous environmental costs, serious social risks, and a tendency to produce low-quality content. In the midst of both excitement and skepticism, it is crucial to take stock of how GenAI is actually being used. Our study focuses on sociological research as our site, and here we present findings from a survey of 433 authors of articles published in 50 sociology journals in the last five years. The survey provides an overview of the state of the discipline with regard to the use of GenAI by providing answers to fundamental questions: how (much) do scholars use the technology for their research; what are their reasons for using it; and how concerned, trustful, and optimistic are they about the technology? Of the approximately one third ofrespondents who self-report using GenAI at least weekly, the primary uses are for writing assistance and comparatively less so in planning, data collection, or data analysis. In both use and attitudes, there are surprisingly few differences between self-identified computational and non-computational researchers. Generally, respondents are very concerned about the social and environmental consequences of GenAI. Trust in GenAI outputs is low, regardless of expertise or frequency of use. While optimism that GenAI will improve is high, scholars are divided on whether GenAI will have a positive impact on the field."}

A major bottleneck lies in the scarcity of large-scale, action-annotated data for dexterous skills, as teleoperation is difficult and costly. Human data, with its vast scale and diverse manipulation behaviors, provides rich priors for learning robotic actions. While prior works have explored leveraging human demonstrations, they are often constrained by limited scenarios and a large visual gap between human and robots. To eliminate these limitations, we propose METIS, a vision-language-action (VLA) model for dexterous manipulation pretrained on multi-source egocentric datasets. We first construct EgoAtlas, which integrates large-scale human and robotic data from multiple sources, all unified under a consistent action space. We further extract motion-aware dynamics, a compact and discretized motion representation, which provides efficient and expressive supervision for VLA training. Built upon them, METIS integrates reasoning and acting into a unified framework, enabling effective deployment to downstream dexterous manipulation tasks. Our method demonstrates exceptional dexterous manipulation capabilities, achieving highest average success rate in six real-world tasks. Experimental results also highlight the superior generalization and robustness to out-of-distribution scenarios. These findings emphasize METIS as a promising step toward a generalist model for dexterous manipulation."}

However, under packet-based communication protocols, any error typically results in the loss of an entire packet, making semantic communication particularly vulnerable to packet loss. Since high-dimensional semantic features must be partitioned into one-dimensional transmission units during packetization. A critical open question is how to partition semantic features to maximize robustness. To address this, we systematically investigate the performance of two mainstream architectures, Transformer and Convolutional neural networks (CNN), under various feature partitioning schemes. The results show that the Transformer architecture exhibits inherent robustness to packet loss when partitioned along the channel dimension. In contrast, the CNN-based baseline exhibits imbalanced channel utilization, causing severe degradation once dominant channels are lost. To enhance the CNN resilience, we propose a lightweight Semantic Equalization Mechanism (SEM) that balances channel contributions and prevents a few channels from dominating. SEM consists of two parallel approaches: a Dynamic Scale module that adaptively adjusts channel importance, and a Broadcast module that facilitates information interaction among channels. Experimental results demonstrate that CNN equipped with SEM achieve graceful degradation under packet loss (retaining about 85% of lossless PSNR at 40% packet loss), comparable to that of Transformer models. Our findings indicate that, under an appropriate partitioning strategy, maintaining a balanced semantic representation is a fundamental condition for achieving intrinsic robustness against packet loss. These insights may also extend to other modalities such as video and support practical semantic communication design."}

In this work, we introduce AMS (Agility Meets Stability), the first framework that unifies both dynamic motion tracking and extreme balance maintenance in a single policy. Our key insight is to leverage heterogeneous data sources: human motion capture datasets that provide rich, agile behaviors, and physically constrained synthetic balance motions that capture stability configurations. To reconcile the divergent optimization goals of agility and stability, we design a hybrid reward scheme that applies general tracking objectives across all data while injecting balance-specific priors only into synthetic motions. Further, an adaptive learning strategy with performance-driven sampling and motion-specific reward shaping enables efficient training across diverse motion distributions. We validate AMS extensively in simulation and on a real Unitree G1 humanoid. Experiments demonstrate that a single policy can execute agile skills such as dancing and running, while also performing zero-shot extreme balance motions like Ip Man's Squat, highlighting AMS as a versatile control paradigm for future humanoid applications."}

Well-known inverse kinematics (IK) techniques can provide mathematically exact solutions (when they exist) for joint configuration determination based solely on the fingertip pose, but often require post-hoc decision-making by considering the positions of all intermediate phalanges in the gripper's fingers, or rely on algorithms to numerically approximate solutions for more complex kinematics. In contrast, our method leverages machine learning to implicitly overcome these challenges. This is achieved through a Conditional Variational Auto-Encoder (CVAE), which takes point cloud data of key structural elements as input and reconstructs the corresponding joint configurations. We validate our approach on the MultiDex grasping dataset using the Allegro Hand, operating within 0.05 milliseconds and achieving accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art methods. This highlights the effectiveness of our pipeline for joint configuration estimation within the broader context of AI-driven techniques for grasp planning."}

However, current approaches largely conceptualize scientific discovery as a solitary optimization or search process, overlooking that knowledge production is inherently a social and historical endeavor. Human scientific insight stems from two distinct yet interconnected sources. First is the individual cognitive trajectory, where a researcher's unique insight is shaped by their evolving research history and stylistic preferences; another is the collective disciplinary memory, where knowledge is sedimented into vast, interconnected networks of citations and concepts. Existing LLMs still struggle to represent these structured, high-fidelity cognitive and social contexts. To bridge this gap, we introduce MirrorMind, a hierarchical cognitive architecture that integrates dual-memory representations within a three-level framework. The Individual Level constructs high-fidelity cognitive models of individual researchers by capturing their episodic, semantic, and persona memories; the Domain Level maps collective knowledge into structured disciplinary concept graphs; and the Interdisciplinary Level that acts as an orthogonal orchestration engine. Crucially, our architecture separates memory storage from agentic execution, enabling AI scientist agents to flexibly access individual memories for unique perspectives or collective structures to reason. We evaluate MirrorMind across four comprehensive tasks, including author-level cognitive simulation, complementary reasoning, cross-disciplinary collaboration promotion, and multi-agent scientific problem solving. The results show that by integrating individual cognitive depth with collective disciplinary breadth, MirrorMind moves beyond simple fact retrieval toward structural, personalized, and insight-generating scientific reasoning."}

Recent work indicates that the use of robot-to-camera transformation information ({\\ie}, camera extrinsics) benefits the learning process and produces better results. However, camera extrinsics are oftentimes unavailable and estimation methods usually suffer from local minima and poor generalizations. In this paper, we present CalibAll, a simple yet effective method that \\textbf{requires only a single mark} and performs training-free, stable, and accurate camera extrinsic estimation across diverse robots and datasets through a coarse-to-fine calibration pipeline. In particular, we annotate a single mark on an end-effector (EEF), and leverage the correspondence ability emerged from vision foundation models (VFM) to automatically localize the corresponding mark across robots in diverse datasets. Using this mark, together with point tracking and the 3D EEF trajectory, we obtain a coarse camera extrinsic via temporal Perspective-n-Point (PnP). This estimate is further refined through a rendering-based optimization that aligns rendered and ground-true masks, yielding accurate and stable camera extrinsic. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, showing strong robustness and general effectiveness across three robot platforms. It also produces useful auxiliary annotations such as depth maps, link-wise masks, and end-effector 2D trajectories, which can further support downstream tasks."}

Existing embodied benchmarks largely focus on passive, static household environments and evaluate only isolated capabilities, failing to capture holistic performance in dynamic, real-world complexity. To fill this gap, we present IndustryNav, the first dynamic industrial navigation benchmark for active spatial reasoning. IndustryNav leverages 12 manually created, high-fidelity Unity warehouse scenarios featuring dynamic objects and human movement. Our evaluation employs a PointGoal navigation pipeline that effectively combines egocentric vision with global odometry to assess holistic local-global planning.

For this reason, IPE provides a useful lens to explain why efforts to govern Artificial Intelligence (AI) at the international and national levels have thus far been developed, applied, and enforced unevenly. Building on recent work that explores how AI companies engage in geopolitics, this position paper argues that some AI workers can be considered actors of geopolitics. It makes the timely case that governance alone cannot ensure responsible, ethical, or robust AI development and use, and greater attention should be paid to bottom-up interventions at the site of AI development. AI workers themselves should be situated as individual agents of change, especially when considering their potential to foster Algorithmic Collective Action (ACA). Drawing on methods of Participatory Design (PD), this paper proposes engaging AI workers as sources of knowledge, relative power, and intentionality to encourage more responsible and just AI development and create the conditions that can facilitate ACA."}

For these agents, scaling involves not only \"thinking\" in tokens but also \"acting\" via tool calls. The number of tool calls directly bounds the agent's interaction with the external environment. However, we find that simply granting agents a larger tool-call budget fails to improve performance, as they lack \"budget awareness\" and quickly hit a performance ceiling. To address this, we study how to scale such agents effectively under explicit tool-call budgets, focusing on web search agents. We first introduce the Budget Tracker, a lightweight plug-in that provides the agent with continuous budget awareness, enabling simple yet effective scaling. We further develop BATS (Budget Aware Test-time Scaling), an advanced framework that leverages this awareness to dynamically adapt its planning and verification strategy, deciding whether to \"dig deeper\" on a promising lead or \"pivot\" to new paths based on remaining resources. To analyze cost-performance scaling in a controlled manner, we formalize a unified cost metric that jointly accounts for token and tool consumption. We provide the first systematic study on budget-constrained agents, showing that budget-aware methods produce more favorable scaling curves and push the cost-performance Pareto frontier. Our work offers empirical insights toward a more transparent and principled understanding of scaling in tool-augmented agents."}

Model-based and learning-based methods often fail in highly dynamic scenarios because traditional methods assume a static environment and cannot adapt to real-time changes, while learning-based methods rely on single-frame observations for motion constraint estimation, limiting their adaptability. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a novel framework that leverages multi-frame point constraints, including current and future frames predicted by a dedicated module, to enable proactive end-to-end navigation. By incorporating a prediction module that forecasts the future path of moving obstacles based on multi-frame observations, our method allows the robot to proactively anticipate and avoid potential dangers. This proactive planning capability significantly enhances navigation robustness and efficiency in unknown dynamic environments.

Despite considerable progress in BCI research, most current motion control systems are limited to discrete commands, rather than supporting continuous pursuit, where users can freely adjust speed and direction in real time. Such natural mobility control is, however, essential for wheelchair users to navigate complex public spaces, such as transit stations, airports, hospitals, and indoor corridors, to interact socially with the dynamic populations with agility, and to move flexibly and comfortably as autonomous driving is refined to allow movement at will. In this study, we address the gap of continuous pursuit motion control in BCIs by proposing and validating a brain-inspired Bayesian inference framework, where embodied dynamics in acceleration-based motor representations are decoded. This approach contrasts with conventional kinematics-level decoding and deep learning-based methods. Using a public dataset with sixteen hours of EEG from four subjects performing motor imagery-based target-following, we demonstrate that our method, utilizing Automatic Relevance Determination for feature selection and continual online learning, reduces the normalized mean squared error between predicted and true velocities by 72% compared to autoregressive and EEGNet-based methods in a session-accumulative transfer learning setting. Theoretically, these findings empirically support embodied cognition theory and reveal the brain's intrinsic motor control dynamics in an embodied and predictive nature. Practically, grounding EEG decoding in the same dynamical principles that govern biological motion offers a promising path toward more stable and intuitive BCI control."}

Dynamic, continuously adaptable resilience is required to ensure their functionality under variable conditions. However, existing resilience architectures usually only deal with adaptation implicitly and thus remain predominantly static. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a new Adaptive Coordination Layer (ACL) and conceptually redefining the Adaptation & Learning Layer (AL). The ACL acts as an operational control layer that detects risks in real time, prioritises countermeasures and coordinates them dynamically. The AL is reinterpreted as a strategic-cooperative layer that evaluates the operational decisions of the ACL, learns from them, and derives long-term adjustments at the policy, governance, and architecture levels. Together, both layers operationalise the resilience principle of adaptation and combine short-term responsiveness with long-term learning and development capabilities. The paper describes various implementation variants of both levels - from rule-based and KPI-driven approaches to AI-supported and meta-learning mechanisms - and shows how these can be combined depending on system complexity, data availability and degree of regulation. The proposed architecture model no longer understands resilience as a static system property, but as a continuous, data-driven process of mutual coordination and systemic learning. This creates a methodological basis for the next generation of adaptive and resilient CPSoS."}

Yet their ability to generalize across new environments, tasks, and embodiments remains limited. We argue that a major bottleneck lies in their foundations: most RFMs are built by fine-tuning internet-pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However, these VLMs are trained on 2D image-language tasks and lack the 3D spatial reasoning inherently required for embodied control in the 3D world. Bridging this gap directly with large-scale robotic data is costly and difficult to scale. Instead, we propose to enrich easy-to-collect non-robotic image data with 3D annotations and enhance a pretrained VLM with 3D understanding capabilities. Following this strategy, we train SPEAR-VLM, a 3D-aware VLM that infers object coordinates in 3D space from a single 2D image. Building on SPEAR-VLM, we introduce our main contribution, $~\\textbf{SPEAR-1}$: a robotic foundation model that integrates grounded 3D perception with language-instructed embodied control.

To leverage the potential of such systems in high-risk applications, we need large, structured tabular datasets on which we can build transparent feature-based models. While part of the EHR already contains structured information (e.g. diagnosis codes, medications, and lab results), much of the information is contained within unstructured text (e.g. discharge summaries and nursing notes). In this work, we propose a method for multi-modal patient-level information extraction that leverages both the tabular features available in the patient's EHR (using an expert-informed Bayesian network) as well as clinical notes describing the patient's symptoms (using neural text classifiers). We propose the use of virtual evidence augmented with a consistency node to provide an interpretable, probabilistic fusion of the models' predictions.

We demonstrate that HALO can plan informative paths that exploit this information to complete missions with multiple tasks specified in natural language. In simulation-based evaluation across large-scale environments of size up to 78,000 sq. m., HALO consistently completes tasks with less exploration time and achieves up to 68% higher competitive ratio in terms of the distance traveled compared to the state-of-the-art semantic exploration baseline.

However, most existing approaches treat observation and action generation in a monolithic and goal-agnostic manner, often leading to semantically misaligned predictions and incoherent behaviors. To this end, we propose H-GAR, a Hierarchical interaction framework via Goal-driven observation-Action Refinement.To anchor prediction to the task objective, H-GAR first produces a goal observation and a coarse action sketch that outline a high-level route toward the goal. To enable explicit interaction between observation and action under the guidance of the goal observation for more coherent decision-making, we devise two synergistic modules. (1) Goal-Conditioned Observation Synthesizer (GOS) synthesizes intermediate observations based on the coarse-grained actions and the predicted goal observation. (2) Interaction-Aware Action Refiner (IAAR) refines coarse actions into fine-grained, goal-consistent actions by leveraging feedback from the intermediate observations and a Historical Action Memory Bank that encodes prior actions to ensure temporal consistency. By integrating goal grounding with explicit action-observation interaction in a coarse-to-fine manner, H-GAR enables more accurate manipulation. Extensive experiments on both simulation and real-world robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate that H-GAR achieves state-of-the-art performance."}

Building on this insight, Progress-Think introduces semantic progress reasoning, predicting instruction-style progress from visual observations to enable more accurate navigation. To achieve this without expensive annotations, we propose a three-stage framework. In the initial stage, Self-Aligned Progress Pretraining bootstraps a reasoning module via a novel differentiable alignment between visual history and instruction prefixes. Then, Progress-Guided Policy Pretraining injects learned progress states into the navigation context, guiding the policy toward consistent actions. Finally, Progress-Policy Co-Finetuning jointly optimizes both modules with tailored progress-aware reinforcement objectives.

Leveraging a comprehensive approximately 30-year dataset encompassing multiple renewable energy sources, our research evaluates two distinct approaches: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model and Non-Linear Autoregressive distributed called with Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model to forecast total power generation using the solar, wind, and hydroelectric resources. The framework uses high temporal resolution and multiple parameters of the environment to improve the predictions. The fact that both the models in terms of error metrics were equally significant and had some unique tendencies at certain circumstances.

We study emergency triage, validating the approach on more than 150,000 admissions to the Bordeaux University Hospital (France) and replicating results on a subset of MIMIC-IV across a different language, population, and healthcare system. In the Bordeaux cohort, otherwise identical presentations were approximately 2.1% more likely to receive a lower-severity triage score when presented as female rather than male; scaled to national emergency volumes in France, this corresponds to more than 200,000 lower-severity assignments per year. Modality-specific analyses indicate that both explicit tabular gender indicators and implicit textual gender cues contribute to the disparity. Beyond emergency care, the approach supports bias audits in other settings (e.g., hiring, academic, and justice decisions), providing a scalable tool to detect and address inequities in real-world decision-making."}

Two complementary lines of experimentation demonstrate its applicability: (i) coupling the ontology with Large Language Models (LLMs) via Logic Augmented Generation (LAG) to assess the contribution of ontological grounding to inferential coherence and consistency; and (ii) integrating the ontology within the Semas reasoning platform, which implements the Triples-to-Beliefs-to-Triples (T2B2T) paradigm, enabling a bidirectional flow between RDF triples and agent mental states.

While intrinsic reward methods have demonstrated effectiveness in single-agent rein-forcement learning scenarios, their application to multi-agent reinforcement learn-ing (MARL) remains problematic. The primary difficulties stem from two fac-tors: (1) the exponential sparsity of joint action trajectories that lead to rewards as the exploration space expands, and (2) existing methods often fail to account for joint actions that can influence team states. To address these challenges, this paper introduces Mutual Intrinsic Reward (MIR), a simple yet effective enhancement strategy for MARL with extremely sparse rewards like episodic rewards. MIR incentivizes individual agents to explore actions that affect their teammates, and when combined with original strategies, effectively stimulates team exploration and improves algorithm performance. For comprehensive experimental valida-tion, we extend the representative single-agent MiniGrid environment to create MiniGrid-MA, a series of MARL environments with sparse rewards. Our evalu-ation compares the proposed method against state-of-the-art approaches in the MiniGrid-MA setting, with experimental results demonstrating superior perfor-mance."}

In this study, we propose a method to enhance the efficiency of robot body design based on black-box optimization by utilizing large language models (LLMs). In parallel with the sampling process based on black-box optimization, sampling is performed using LLMs, which are provided with problem settings and extensive feedback. We demonstrate that this method enables more efficient exploration of design solutions and discuss its characteristics and limitations."}

To bridge this gap this study conducts a scoping review of methodologies and research trends in AI carbon footprint assessment. We analyze the classification and standardization status of existing AI carbon measurement tools and methodologies, and comparatively examine the environmental impacts arising from both training and inference stages. In addition, we identify how multidimensional factors such as model size, prompt complexity, serving environments, and system boundary definitions shape the resulting carbon footprint. Our review reveals critical limitations in current AI carbon accounting practices, including methodological inconsistencies, technology-specific biases, and insufficient attention to end-to-end system perspectives. Building on these insights, we propose future research and governance directions: (1) establishing standardized and transparent universal measurement protocols, (2) designing dynamic evaluation frameworks that incorporate user behavior, (3) developing life-cycle monitoring systems that encompass embodied emissions, and (4) advancing multidimensional sustainability assessment framework that balance model performance with environmental efficiency.

This article uses a calibrated agent-based model to examine how alternative progression regimes reconfigure dropout, time-to-degree, equity and students' psychological experience in a long, tightly sequenced engineering programme. Building on a leakage-aware longitudinal dataset of 1,343 students and a Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of time-to-dropout, we simulate three policy scenarios: (A) a historical \"regularity + finals\" regime, where students accumulate exam debt; (B) a direct-promotion regime that removes regularity and finals but requires full course completion each term; and (C) a direct-promotion regime complemented by a capacity-limited remedial \"safety net\" for marginal failures in bottleneck courses. The model is empirically calibrated to reproduce the observed dropout curve under Scenario A and then used to explore counterfactuals. Results show that direct promotion creates a \"promotion wall\": attrition becomes sharply front-loaded in the first two years, overall dropout rises, and equity gaps between low- and high-resilience students widen, even as exam debt disappears. The safety-net scenario partially dismantles this wall: it reduces dropout and equity gaps relative to pure direct promotion and yields the lowest final stress levels, at the cost of additional, targeted teaching capacity. These findings position progression rules as central objects of assessment policy rather than neutral background. The article argues that claims of improved efficiency are incomplete unless they are evaluated jointly with inclusion, equity and students' psychological wellbeing, and it illustrates how simulation-based decision support can help institutions rehearse assessment reforms before implementing them."}

Fields such as remote sensing, requiring specialized tools (e.g., correction, spectral indices calculation), and multi-step procedures (e.g., numerous intermediate products and optional steps), significantly challenge generalized approaches. To address this gap, we introduce a novel agent design framework centered on a Hierarchical Task Abstraction Mechanism (HTAM). Specifically, HTAM moves beyond emulating social roles, instead structuring multi-agent systems into a logical hierarchy that mirrors the intrinsic task-dependency graph of a given domain. This task-centric architecture thus enforces procedural correctness and decomposes complex problems into sequential layers, where each layer's sub-agents operate on the outputs of the preceding layers. We instantiate this framework as EarthAgent, a multi-agent system tailored for complex geospatial analysis. To evaluate such complex planning capabilities, we build GeoPlan-bench, a comprehensive benchmark of realistic, multi-step geospatial planning tasks. It is accompanied by a suite of carefully designed metrics to evaluate tool selection, path similarity, and logical completeness. Experiments show that EarthAgent substantially outperforms a range of established single- and multi-agent systems. Our work demonstrates that aligning agent architecture with a domain's intrinsic task structure is a critical step toward building robust and reliable specialized autonomous systems."}

Massive MIMO transmission enables beamforming, beam steering, and spatial multiplexing across multiple transmission layers, with the number of simultaneous transmission paths depending on the rank of the radio channel, further named 'transmission rank'. Since the total transmission power of a base station is shared among these layers, rank variations affect the measured exposure levels, e.g., when assessments use provoked traffic via user equipment. This study investigates the impact of the transmission rank on the measured maximum exposure in the 3.6 GHz (n78) band of a German 5G network employing massive MIMO technology. Field measurements were performed using a spectrum analyzer with isotropic probe, to capture maximum field strengths under full-load traffic conditions. The transmission rank was manipulated by artificially degrading the reception quality of the user equipment with a shielding bag, forcing a single transmission layer (rank-1). The results were compared with unshielded operation allowing up to the maximum number of four independent transmission layers (rank-4). The data reveal exposure differences ranging from 1.7 dB to 5.4 dB, with a median of 4.3 dB at the measurement points studied. These findings highlight the necessity of considering the transmission rank in exposure assessments to electromagnetic fields."}

Unlike previous works on this topic, we do not assume that the net has been previously ballistically thrown toward the target, and we start from a relatively static configuration. The results show that a more compliant net achieves higher performance when attempting the capture of Envisat. Moreover, when paired with a sliding mode controller, soft nets are able to achieve successful capture in 100% of the tested cases, whilst also showcasing a higher effective area at contact and a higher number of contact points between net and Envisat."}

Well-known inverse kinematics (IK) techniques can provide mathematically exact solutions (when they exist) for joint configuration determination based solely on the fingertip pose, but often require post-hoc decision-making by considering the positions of all intermediate phalanges in the gripper's fingers, or rely on algorithms to numerically approximate solutions for more complex kinematics. In contrast, our method leverages machine learning to implicitly overcome these challenges. This is achieved through a Conditional Variational Auto-Encoder (CVAE), which takes point cloud data of key structural elements as input and reconstructs the corresponding joint configurations. We validate our approach on the MultiDex grasping dataset using the Allegro Hand, operating within 0.05 milliseconds and achieving accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art methods. This highlights the effectiveness of our pipeline for joint configuration estimation within the broader context of AI-driven techniques for grasp planning."}

In this paper, we present a novel approach to monocular vision-based exploration that can safely cover large-scale unstructured indoor and outdoor 3D environments by explicitly accounting for the properties of a sparse monocular SLAM frontend in both mapping and planning. The mapping module solves the problems of sparse depth data, free-space gaps, and large depth uncertainty by oversampling free space in texture-sparse areas and keeping track of obstacle position uncertainty. The planning module handles the added free-space uncertainty through rapid replanning and perception-aware heading control. We further show that frontier-based exploration is possible with sparse monocular depth data when parallax requirements and the possibility of textureless surfaces are taken into account. We evaluate our approach extensively in diverse real-world and simulated environments, including ablation studies. To the best of the authors' knowledge, the proposed method is the first to achieve 3D monocular exploration in real-world unstructured outdoor environments. We open-source our implementation to support future research."}

Building on recent work that explores how AI companies engage in geopolitics, this position paper argues that some AI workers can be considered actors of geopolitics. It makes the timely case that governance alone cannot ensure responsible, ethical, or robust AI development and use, and greater attention should be paid to bottom-up interventions at the site of AI development. AI workers themselves should be situated as individual agents of change, especially when considering their potential to foster Algorithmic Collective Action (ACA).

By using six large-scale datasets, comprising over 500 million Telegram messages collected between 2015 and 2024, we analyze toxic user behavior across multiple chats and languages. We introduce a methodological framework that models user adaptation through a conformity index, capturing conformist, anti-conformist, and independent behavioral tendencies. Our findings show that most users tend to conform to local normative environments, adjusting their toxicity to match the toxicity levels of the chats in which they participate. These patterns are consistent across datasets and languages, suggesting that community norms and social influence play a decisive role in shaping user behavior online. Furthermore, we demonstrate that exposure to these norms, in terms of increased user participation in chats, is associated with a stronger tendency toward conformity with the surrounding social contexts. Collectively, these findings contribute to a deeper understanding of toxic online behavior and highlight the importance of contextualized approaches to content moderation."}

This paper focuses on human-robot interaction (HRI) based on human-robot dialogue that relies on the robot action confirmation and action step generation using multimodal scene understanding. The state-of-the-art approach uses multimodal transformers to generate robot action steps aligned with robot action confirmation from a single clip showing a task composed of multiple micro steps. Although actions towards a long-horizon task depend on each other throughout an entire video, the current approaches mainly focus on clip-level processing and do not leverage long-context information. This paper proposes a long-context Q-former incorporating left and right context dependency in full videos. Furthermore, this paper proposes a text-conditioning approach to feed text embeddings directly into the LLM decoder to mitigate the high abstraction of the information in text by Q-former.

A major bottleneck lies in the scarcity of large-scale, action-annotated data for dexterous skills, as teleoperation is difficult and costly. Human data, with its vast scale and diverse manipulation behaviors, provides rich priors for learning robotic actions. While prior works have explored leveraging human demonstrations, they are often constrained by limited scenarios and a large visual gap between human and robots. To eliminate these limitations, we propose METIS, a vision-language-action (VLA) model for dexterous manipulation pretrained on multi-source egocentric datasets. We first construct EgoAtlas, which integrates large-scale human and robotic data from multiple sources, all unified under a consistent action space. We further extract motion-aware dynamics, a compact and discretized motion representation, which provides efficient and expressive supervision for VLA training. Built upon them, METIS integrates reasoning and acting into a unified framework, enabling effective deployment to downstream dexterous manipulation tasks. Our method demonstrates exceptional dexterous manipulation capabilities, achieving highest average success rate in six real-world tasks. Experimental results also highlight the superior generalization and robustness to out-of-distribution scenarios. These findings emphasize METIS as a promising step toward a generalist model for dexterous manipulation."}

Recent advances in locomotion and whole-body tracking have enabled impressive progress in either agile dynamic skills or stability-critical behaviors, but existing methods remain specialized, focusing on one capability while compromising the other. In this work, we introduce AMS (Agility Meets Stability), the first framework that unifies both dynamic motion tracking and extreme balance maintenance in a single policy. Our key insight is to leverage heterogeneous data sources: human motion capture datasets that provide rich, agile behaviors, and physically constrained synthetic balance motions that capture stability configurations. To reconcile the divergent optimization goals of agility and stability, we design a hybrid reward scheme that applies general tracking objectives across all data while injecting balance-specific priors only into synthetic motions. Further, an adaptive learning strategy with performance-driven sampling and motion-specific reward shaping enables efficient training across diverse motion distributions. We validate AMS extensively in simulation and on a real Unitree G1 humanoid. Experiments demonstrate that a single policy can execute agile skills such as dancing and running, while also performing zero-shot extreme balance motions like Ip Man's Squat, highlighting AMS as a versatile control paradigm for future humanoid applications."}

IndustryNav leverages 12 manually created, high-fidelity Unity warehouse scenarios featuring dynamic objects and human movement. Our evaluation employs a PointGoal navigation pipeline that effectively combines egocentric vision with global odometry to assess holistic local-global planning. Crucially, we introduce the \"collision rate\" and \"warning rate\" metrics to measure safety-oriented behaviors and distance estimation. A comprehensive study of nine state-of-the-art VLLMs (including models such as GPT-5-mini, Claude-4.5, and Gemini-2.5) reveals that closed-source models maintain a consistent advantage; however, all agents exhibit notable deficiencies in robust path planning, collision avoidance and active exploration.

Despite considerable progress in BCI research, most current motion control systems are limited to discrete commands, rather than supporting continuous pursuit, where users can freely adjust speed and direction in real time. Such natural mobility control is, however, essential for wheelchair users to navigate complex public spaces, such as transit stations, airports, hospitals, and indoor corridors, to interact socially with the dynamic populations with agility, and to move flexibly and comfortably as autonomous driving is refined to allow movement at will. In this study, we address the gap of continuous pursuit motion control in BCIs by proposing and validating a brain-inspired Bayesian inference framework, where embodied dynamics in acceleration-based motor representations are decoded. This approach contrasts with conventional kinematics-level decoding and deep learning-based methods. Using a public dataset with sixteen hours of EEG from four subjects performing motor imagery-based target-following, we demonstrate that our method, utilizing Automatic Relevance Determination for feature selection and continual online learning, reduces the normalized mean squared error between predicted and true velocities by 72% compared to autoregressive and EEGNet-based methods in a session-accumulative transfer learning setting. Theoretically, these findings empirically support embodied cognition theory and reveal the brain's intrinsic motor control dynamics in an embodied and predictive nature. Practically, grounding EEG decoding in the same dynamical principles that govern biological motion offers a promising path toward more stable and intuitive BCI control."}

However, natural examples of many behaviours are rare, forcing researchers to rely on synthetic or off-policy LLM responses for training probes. We systematically evaluate how the use of synthetic and off-policy data influences probe generalisation across eight distinct LLM behaviours. Testing linear and attention probes across multiple LLMs, we find that the response generation strategy can significantly affect probe performance, though the magnitude of this effect varies by behaviour. We find that successful generalisation from off-policy data, to test sets where the model is incentivised to produce the target behaviour, is predictive of successful on-policy generalisation. Leveraging this result, we predict that Deception and Sandbagging probes may fail to generalise from off-policy to on-policy data when used in real monitoring scenarios. Notably, shifts in the training data domain still cause even larger performance degradation, with different-domain test scores being consistently lower than the same-domain ones. These results indicate that, in the absence of on-policy data, using same-domain off-policy data yields more reliable probes than using on-policy data from a different domain, emphasizing the need for methods that can better handle distribution shifts in LLM monitoring."}

However, these VLMs are trained on 2D image-language tasks and lack the 3D spatial reasoning inherently required for embodied control in the 3D world. Bridging this gap directly with large-scale robotic data is costly and difficult to scale. Instead, we propose to enrich easy-to-collect non-robotic image data with 3D annotations and enhance a pretrained VLM with 3D understanding capabilities. Following this strategy, we train SPEAR-VLM, a 3D-aware VLM that infers object coordinates in 3D space from a single 2D image.

SRA-CP introduces a decentralized protocol where connected agents continuously broadcast lightweight perception coverage summaries and initiate targeted cooperation only when risk-relevant blind zones are detected. A perceptual risk identification module enables each CV to locally assess the impact of occlusions on its driving task and determine whether cooperation is necessary. When CP is triggered, the ego vehicle selects appropriate peers based on shared perception coverage and engages in selective information exchange through a fusion module that prioritizes safety-critical content and adapts to bandwidth constraints. We evaluate SRA-CP on a public dataset against several representative baselines. Results show that SRA-CP achieves less than 1% average precision (AP) loss for safety-critical objects compared to generic CP, while using only 20% of the communication bandwidth. Moreover, it improves the perception performance by 15% over existing selective CP methods that do not incorporate risk awareness."}

However, existing diffusion and autoregressive approaches are limited by iterative sampling, sequential decoding, or task-specific designs, which hinder efficiency and reuse. We propose Masked Denoising Generation (MDG), a unified generative framework that reformulates multi-agent behavior modeling as the reconstruction of independently noised spatiotemporal tensors. Instead of relying on diffusion time steps or discrete tokenization, MDG applies continuous, per-agent and per-timestep noise masks that enable localized denoising and controllable trajectory generation in a single or few forward passes. This mask-driven formulation generalizes across open-loop prediction, closed-loop simulation, motion planning, and conditional generation within one model. Trained on large-scale real-world driving datasets, MDG achieves competitive closed-loop performance on the Waymo Sim Agents and nuPlan Planning benchmarks, while providing efficient, consistent, and controllable open-loop multi-agent trajectory generation. These results position MDG as a simple yet versatile paradigm for multi-agent behavior modeling."}

Our system, named HALO, addresses two key challenges: (i) real-time dense 3D reconstruction using vision at large distances, and (ii) mapping and exploration of large-scale outdoor environments with accurate scene geometry and semantics. We demonstrate that HALO can plan informative paths that exploit this information to complete missions with multiple tasks specified in natural language. In simulation-based evaluation across large-scale environments of size up to 78,000 sq. m., HALO consistently completes tasks with less exploration time and achieves up to 68% higher competitive ratio in terms of the distance traveled compared to the state-of-the-art semantic exploration baseline. We use real-world experiments on a custom quadrotor platform to demonstrate that (i) all modules can run onboard the robot, and that (ii) in diverse environments HALO can support effective autonomous execution of missions covering up to 24,600 sq. m. area at an altitude of 40 m.

The world model leverages action and visual inputs to predict future image states, learning the underlying physics of the environment to refine action generation. Conversely, the VLA model produces subsequent actions from image observations, enhancing visual understanding and supporting the world model's image generation. The unified framework of RynnVLA-002 enables joint learning of environmental dynamics and action planning. Our experiments show that RynnVLA-002 surpasses individual VLA and world models, demonstrating their mutual enhancement. We evaluate RynnVLA-002 in both simulation and real-world robot tasks. RynnVLA-002 achieves 97.4% success rate on the LIBERO simulation benchmark without pretraining, while in real-world LeRobot experiments, its integrated world model boosts the overall success rate by 50%."}
