Downside-focused\nagents targeting low quantiles reduce risk in states with high variance, while\nthose with a preference for high quantiles concentrate in sleeves with high\ndispersion when there is potential for upside. These results provide a\nmicrofoundation for volatility management, demonstrating that reducing exposure\nin volatile states is an optimal response for risk-averse investors and\nrationalising inverse-variance heuristics. We propose a distributional\nactor-critic algorithm that learns time-consistent policies tailored to these\nspecific risks, irrespective of the utilitys functional form. The quantile\nvalue can be mapped onto interpretable tilts, and the performance of\nempirically chosen portfolios aligns with investors objectives."}

In traditional discrete games,\nplayers are assumed to perfectly know their own payoffs when making decisions,\nignoring that information acquisition can be a strategic choice. In the\nproposed framework, I relax this assumption by allowing players to face\nuncertainty about their own payoffs and to optimally choose both the precision\nof information and their actions, balancing the expected payoffs from precise\ninformation against the information cost. The model provides a unified\nstructure to analyze how information and strategic interactions jointly\ndetermine equilibrium outcomes. The model primitives are point identified, and\nthe identification results are illustrated through Monte Carlo experiments. The\nempirical application of the U.S airline entry game shows that the low-cost\ncarriers acquire less precise information about profits and incur lower\ninformation costs than other airlines, which is consistent with their business\nmodel that focuses on cost efficiency.

We model financial distress propagation\nas a diffusion process on weighted networks, deriving a network diffusion\nequation from first principles that predicts contagion decay depends on the\nnetwork's algebraic connectivity through the relation $\\kappa =\n\\sqrt{\\lambda_2/D}$, where $\\lambda_2$ is the second-smallest eigenvalue of the\ngraph Laplacian and $D$ is the diffusion coefficient. Applying this framework\nto European banking data from the EBA stress tests (2018, 2021, 2023), we\nestimate interbank exposure networks using maximum entropy methods and track\nthe evolution of systemic risk through the COVID-19 crisis. Our key finding is\nthat network connectivity declined by 45\\% from 2018 to 2023, implying a 26\\%\nreduction in the contagion decay parameter.

Simultaneously, Early Exit determines the optimal stopping point during\nthe iterative reasoning process. Both methods seek to reduce the computational\nburden.

However, as TNC markets\nexpand and mature, the complementary and substitutive relationships with PT may\nshift. To explore whether such a transformation is occurring, this study\ncollected travel data from 96,716 ride-hailing vehicles during September 2022\nin Shanghai, a city characterized by an increasingly saturated TNC market. An\nenhanced data-driven framework is proposed to classify TNC-PT relationships\ninto four types: first-mile complementary, last-mile complementary,\nsubstitutive, and independent. Our findings indicate comparable ratios of\ncomplementary trips (9.22%) and substitutive trips (9.06%), contrasting sharply\nwith the findings of prior studies. Furthermore, to examine the nonlinear\nimpact of various influential factors on these ratios, a machine learning\nmethod integrating categorical boosting (CatBoost) and Shapley additive\nexplanations (SHAP) is proposed. The results show significant nonlinear effects\nin some variables, including the distance to the nearest metro station and the\ndensity of bus stops. Moreover, metro hubs and regular single-line stations\nexhibit distinct effects on first- or last-mile complementary ratios. These\nratios' relation to the distance to single-line stations shows an inverted\nU-shaped pattern, with effects rising sharply within 1.5 km, remaining at the\npeak between 1.5 and 3 km, and then declining as the distance increases to\nabout 15 km."}

To\nfurther enhance reasoning capabilities, we integrate RL with a hierarchical\nreward structure, scaled by a difficulty-aware factor that prioritizes\nchallenging decision points.

To the best of the authors' knowledge, SHRUMS is the first underwater\nautonomous navigation stack to integrate a 3D sonar. The proposed pipeline\nexhibits strong robustness while operating in complex 3D environments in spite\nof extremely poor visibility conditions. To accommodate the intricacies of the\nnovel sensor data stream while achieving real-time locally optimal performance,\nSHRUMS introduces the concept of hallucinating sensor measurements from\nnon-existent sensors with convenient arbitrary parameters, tailored to\napplication specific requirements. The proposed concepts are validated with\nreal 3D sonar sensor data, utilizing real inputs in challenging settings and\nlocal maps constructed in real-time. Field deployments validating the proposed\napproach in full are planned in the very near future."}

The\ncourse was an AI-enhanced design course, with several interventions to equip\nstudents with AI based design skills. Students were required to reflect on\nwhether the technology was used as a tool (instrumental assistant), a teammate\n(collaborative partner), or neither (deliberate non-use). By foregrounding this\nthree-way lens, students learned to use AI for innovation rather than just\nautomation and to reflect on agency, ethics, and context rather than on prompt\ncrafting alone. Evidence stems from coursework artefacts: thirteen structured\nreflection spreadsheets and eight illustrated briefs submitted, combined with\nnotes of teachers and researchers. Qualitative coding of these materials\nreveals shared practices brought about through the inclusion of Gen-AI,\nincluding accelerated prototyping, rapid skill acquisition, iterative prompt\nrefinement, purposeful \"switch-offs\" during user research, and emergent\nroutines for recognizing hallucinations. Unexpectedly, students not only\nharnessed Gen-AI for speed but (enabled by the tool-teammate-neither triage)\nalso learned to reject its outputs, invent their own hallucination fire-drills,\nand divert the reclaimed hours into deeper user research, thereby transforming\nefficiency into innovation. The implications of the approach we explore shows\nthat: we can transform AI uptake into an assessable design habit; that\nrewarding selective non-use cultivates hallucination-aware workflows; and,\npractically, that a coordinated bundle of tool access, reflection, role\ntagging, and public recognition through competition awards allows AI based\ninnovation in education to scale without compromising accountability."}

In this paper, we propose a fully autonomous hierarchical\nframework for solving challenging DLO routing tasks. Given an implicit or\nexplicit routing goal expressed in language, our framework leverages\nvision-language models~(VLMs) for in-context high-level reasoning to synthesize\nfeasible plans, which are then executed by low-level skills trained via\nreinforcement learning. To improve robustness in long horizons, we further\nintroduce a failure recovery mechanism that reorients the DLO into\ninsertion-feasible states.

This paper examines how these digital migrants navigate\ncross-cultural platform environments and develop adaptive communicative\nstrategies under algorithmic governance. Drawing on a multi-method framework,\nthe study analyzes temporal posting patterns, influence dynamics, thematic\npreferences, and sentiment-weighted topic expressions across three distinct\nmigration phases: Pre-Ban, Refugee Surge, and Stabilization.\n  An entropy-weighted influence score was used to classify users into high- and\nlow-influence groups, enabling comparative analysis of content strategies.\nFindings reveal that while dominant topics remained relatively stable over time\n(e.g., self-expression, lifestyle, and creativity), high-influence users were\nmore likely to engage in culturally resonant or commercially strategic content.\nAdditionally, political discourse was not avoided, but selectively activated as\na point of transnational engagement.\n  Emotionally, high-influence users tended to express more positive affect in\nculturally connective topics, while low-influence users showed stronger\nemotional intensity in personal narratives. These findings suggest that\ncross-cultural platform migration is shaped not only by structural affordances\nbut also by users' differential capacities to adapt, perform, and maintain\nvisibility.

We find that UniqueRank identifies\nimportant nodes with dissimilar attributes from its neighbors in simple\nsymmetric networks with known ground truth. Further, on real terrorist, social,\nand supply chain networks, we demonstrate that removing and attempting to\nreplace top UniqueRank nodes often yields larger efficiency reductions than\nremoving and attempting to replace top nodes ranked by competing methods.\nFinally, we show UniqueRank's versatility by demonstrating its potential to\nidentify structurally critical atoms with unique chemical environments in\nbiomolecular structures."}

Existing methods\noften struggle with modeling heterogeneous agents possessing persistent latent\ntraits (e.g., skills, preferences) and dealing with complex multi-agent system\ndynamics. These challenges are compounded by the critical need for high sample\nefficiency due to costly real-world interactions. World Models, by learning to\npredict environmental dynamics, offer a promising pathway to enhance mechanism\ndesign in heterogeneous and complex systems. In this paper, we introduce a\nnovel method named SWM-AP (Social World Model-Augmented Mechanism Design Policy\nLearning), which learns a social world model hierarchically modeling agents'\nbehavior to enhance mechanism design. Specifically, the social world model\ninfers agents' traits from their interaction trajectories and learns a\ntrait-based model to predict agents' responses to the deployed mechanisms. The\nmechanism design policy collects extensive training trajectories by interacting\nwith the social world model, while concurrently inferring agents' traits online\nduring real-world interactions to further boost policy learning efficiency.\nExperiments in diverse settings (tax policy design, team coordination, and\nfacility location) demonstrate that SWM-AP outperforms established model-based\nand model-free RL baselines in cumulative rewards and sample efficiency."}

Existing methods\noften struggle with modeling heterogeneous agents possessing persistent latent\ntraits (e.g., skills, preferences) and dealing with complex multi-agent system\ndynamics. These challenges are compounded by the critical need for high sample\nefficiency due to costly real-world interactions. World Models, by learning to\npredict environmental dynamics, offer a promising pathway to enhance mechanism\ndesign in heterogeneous and complex systems. In this paper, we introduce a\nnovel method named SWM-AP (Social World Model-Augmented Mechanism Design Policy\nLearning), which learns a social world model hierarchically modeling agents'\nbehavior to enhance mechanism design. Specifically, the social world model\ninfers agents' traits from their interaction trajectories and learns a\ntrait-based model to predict agents' responses to the deployed mechanisms. The\nmechanism design policy collects extensive training trajectories by interacting\nwith the social world model, while concurrently inferring agents' traits online\nduring real-world interactions to further boost policy learning efficiency.\nExperiments in diverse settings (tax policy design, team coordination, and\nfacility location) demonstrate that SWM-AP outperforms established model-based\nand model-free RL baselines in cumulative rewards and sample efficiency."}

Current methods for learning and\nevaluating world models diverge from this goal: training and evaluation are\nanchored to next-frame prediction, and success is scored by reward maximization\nin the same environment. We propose WorldTest, a protocol to evaluate\nmodel-learning agents that separates reward-free interaction from a scored test\nphase in a different but related environment. WorldTest is\nopen-ended$\\unicode{x2014}$models should support many different tasks unknown\nahead of time$\\unicode{x2014}$and agnostic to model representation, allowing\ncomparison across approaches. We instantiated WorldTest with AutumnBench, a\nsuite of 43 interactive grid-world environments and 129 tasks across three\nfamilies: masked-frame prediction, planning, and predicting changes to the\ncausal dynamics. We compared 517 human participants and three frontier models\non AutumnBench. We found that humans outperform the models, and scaling compute\nimproves performance only in some environments but not others. WorldTest\nprovides a novel template$\\unicode{x2014}$reward-free exploration, derived\ntests, and behavior-based scoring$\\unicode{x2014}$to evaluate what agents learn\nabout environment dynamics, and AutumnBench exposes significant headroom in\nworld-model learning."}

Since its release in 2022, OpenAI's ChatGPT and other large language\nmodels have raised the alarms inside news organizations, not only for bringing\nnew challenges to news reporting and fact-checking but also for what these\ntechnologies would mean for journalists' professional authority in journalism.\nThis paper examines how journalists in Dutch media manage the integration of AI\ntechnologies into their daily routines. Drawing from 13 interviews with\neditors, journalists, and innovation managers in different news outlets and\nmedia companies, we propose the concept of controlled change. as a heuristic to\nexplain how journalists are proactively setting guidelines, experimenting with\nAI tools, and identifying their limitations and capabilities. Using\nprofessional authority as a theoretical framework, we argue that journalists\nanticipate and integrate AI technologies in a supervised manner and identify\nthree primary mechanisms through which journalists manage this integration: (1)\ndeveloping adaptive guidelines that align AI use with ethical codes, (2)\nexperimenting with AI technologies to determine their necessity and fit, and\n(3) critically assessing the capabilities and limitations of AI systems."}

This\nstudy tests a practitioner-in-the-loop workflow that pairs transparent\ndecision-tree models with large language models (LLMs) to improve predictive\naccuracy, interpretability, and the generation of practical insights. Using\ndata from an ongoing college-success program, we build interpretable decision\ntrees to surface key predictors. We then provide each tree's structure to an\nLLM, enabling it to reproduce case-level predictions grounded in the\ntransparent models. Practitioners participate throughout feature engineering,\nmodel design, explanation review, and usability assessment, ensuring that field\nexpertise informs the analysis at every stage. Results show that integrating\ntransparent models, LLMs, and practitioner input yields accurate, trustworthy,\nand actionable case-level evaluations, offering a viable pathway for\nresponsible AI adoption in the public and nonprofit sectors."}
