The block maxima (BM) method, a particular approach within EVT,\nstarts by dividing the historical observations into blocks.

The\nquestion of automatic (i.e., without explicit expert input) selection of the\nblock size remains an open challenge. This work proposes a novel Bayesian\nframework, namely, multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MOBO-D*), to optimize\nBM blocking for accurate modeling and prediction of extremes in EVT. MOBO-D*\nformulates two objectives: goodness-of-fit of the distribution of extreme\nevents and the accurate prediction of extreme events to construct an estimated\nPareto front for optimal blocking choices. The efficacy of the proposed\nframework is illustrated by applying it to a real-world case study from the\ndomain of additive manufacturing as well as a synthetic dataset.

Therefore, the community has been\nfocusing on generating safety-critical scenarios in simulation.

We introduce a new task called controllable collision\nscenario generation, where the goal is to produce trajectories that realize a\nuser-specified collision type and TTA, to investigate the feasibility of\nautomatically generating desired collision scenarios. To support this task, we\npresent COLLIDE, a large-scale collision scenario dataset constructed by\ntransforming real-world driving logs into diverse collisions, balanced across\nfive representative collision types and different TTA intervals. We propose a\nframework that predicts Collision Pattern, a compact and interpretable\nrepresentation that captures the spatial configuration of the ego and the\nadversarial vehicles at impact, before rolling out full adversarial\ntrajectories.

In this paper, we propose a novel\nstructure-aware synthetic propagation enhanced detection (StruSP) framework to\nfully capture structural dynamics from real propagation.

Most existing\nresearch has focused on behavioral cloning, effectively evaluating how well\nmodels reproduce individuals' expressed preferences. Drawing on theories of\npolitical representation, we highlight an underexplored design trade-off:\nwhether AI systems should act as delegates, mirroring expressed preferences, or\nas trustees, exercising judgment about what best serves an individual's\ninterests. This trade-off is closely related to issues of LLM sycophancy, where\nmodels can encourage behavior or validate beliefs that may be aligned with a\nuser's short-term preferences, but is detrimental to their long-term interests.\nThrough a series of experiments simulating votes on various policy issues in\nthe U.S. context, we apply a temporal utility framework that weighs short and\nlong-term interests (simulating a trustee role) and compare voting outcomes to\nbehavior-cloning models (simulating a delegate). We find that trustee-style\npredictions weighted toward long-term interests produce policy decisions that\nalign more closely with expert consensus on well-understood issues, but also\nshow greater bias toward models' default stances on topics lacking clear\nagreement.

Endoluminal procedures, such as bronchoscopy, demand precise and\nsafe navigation through tortuous, patient-specific anatomy where conventional\ntip-only control often leads to wall contact, tissue trauma, or failure to\nreach distal targets. To address these challenges, our approach combines a\nphysics-informed backbone model with residual learning through an Augmented\nNeural ODE, enabling accurate shape estimation and efficient Jacobian\ncomputation. A sampling-based Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) controller\nleverages this representation to jointly optimize tip tracking, backbone\nconformance, and obstacle avoidance under actuation constraints.

It uses an evolutionary process to\ngenerate think-prefixes, which are instructions that evolve driven by a\ntaxonomy of reasoning behaviors to guide models toward superior performance.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate ThinkPilot's broad effectiveness: it\nsignificantly improves the accuracy-length trade-off for efficient reasoning,\ndrastically improves safety (for example, cutting the StrongREJECT score of\nDeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B from 27.0% to 0.7), and enhances instruction\nfollowing. It also synergizes with existing training-based methods. Our\nanalysis reveals that think-prefixes can reliably control LRMs' reasoning\nbehaviors, and that different tasks have strong preferences for specific\nbehavioral distributions.

In our experiments, we\ndemonstrate that more comprehensive planning methods can significantly enhance\nthe performance of the robotic manipulator. Finally, we implement the proposed\nworkflow on a real-world robot. As a result, this work complements previous\nefforts on robotic pruning and motivates future research and development in\nplanning for pruning applications."}

Traditional numerical models,\nmeanwhile, simplify complex linguistic attitudes into discrete values, lacking\ninterpretability, behavioral consistency, and the ability to integrate multiple\ntopics. To address these issues, we propose Multi-topic Opinion Simulation\n(MTOS), a social simulation framework integrating multi-topic contexts with\nLLMs. MTOS leverages LLMs alongside short-term and long-term memory,\nincorporates multiple user-selection interaction mechanisms and dynamic\ntopic-selection strategies, and employs a belief decay mechanism to enable\nperspective updates across topics. We conduct extensive experiments on MTOS,\nvarying topic numbers, correlation types, and performing ablation studies to\nassess features such as group polarization and local consistency.

These applications rely heavily on access\nto high-quality, large-scale real-world hypergraph data. Yet, compared to\ntraditional pairwise graphs, real hypergraph datasets remain scarce in both\nscale and diversity. This shortage significantly limits the development and\nevaluation of advanced hypergraph learning algorithms. Therefore, how to\nquickly generate large-scale hypergraphs that conform to the characteristics of\nreal networks is a crucial task that has not received sufficient attention.\nMotivated by recent advances in large language models (LLMs), particularly\ntheir capabilities in semantic reasoning, structured generation, and simulating\nhuman behavior, we investigate whether LLMs can facilitate hypergraph\ngeneration from a fundamentally new perspective. We introduce HyperLLM, a novel\nLLM-driven hypergraph generator that simulates the formation and evolution of\nhypergraphs through a multi-agent collaboration. The framework integrates\nprompts and structural feedback mechanisms to ensure that the generated\nhypergraphs reflect key real-world patterns. Extensive experiments across\ndiverse datasets demonstrate that HyperLLM achieves superior fidelity to\nstructural and temporal hypergraph patterns, while requiring minimal\nstatistical priors.

The increase of\nrenewables has made significant impacts both on central electricity markets and\ndistribution-level grids as renewable power generation is often connected to\nthe latter. These stochastic renewable technologies have both advantages and\ndisadvantages. On one hand they offer very low marginal cost and carbon\nemissions, while on the other hand, their output is uncertain, requiring\nflexible backup power with high marginal cost. Flexibility from end-prosumers\nor smaller market participants is therefore seen as a key enabler of\nlarge-scale integration of renewables. However, current central electricity\nmarkets do not directly include uncertainty into the market clearing and do not\naccount for physical constraints of distribution grids. In this paper we\npropose a local electricity market framework based on probabilistic locational\nmarginal pricing, effectively accounting for uncertainties in production,\nconsumption and grid variables. The model includes a representation of the grid\nusing the lindistflow equations and accounts for the propagation of uncertainty\nusing general Polynomial Chaos (gPC). A two-stage convex model is proposed; in\nthe day-ahead stage, probability distributions of prices are calculated for\nevery timestep, where the expected values represent the day-ahead (spot)\nprices. In the real-time stage, uncertainties are realized (measured) and a\ntrivial calculation reveals the real-time price.

A sampling-based Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) controller\nleverages this representation to jointly optimize tip tracking, backbone\nconformance, and obstacle avoidance under actuation constraints.

This trade-off is closely related to issues of LLM sycophancy, where\nmodels can encourage behavior or validate beliefs that may be aligned with a\nuser's short-term preferences, but is detrimental to their long-term interests.\nThrough a series of experiments simulating votes on various policy issues in\nthe U.S. context, we apply a temporal utility framework that weighs short and\nlong-term interests (simulating a trustee role) and compare voting outcomes to\nbehavior-cloning models (simulating a delegate).

The key difficulty is verification: suggested proofs\nmay look plausible, but cannot be trusted without rigorous checking.

Our focus is on asymptotic inequalities, a topic that often involves\ndifficult proofs and appropriate decomposition of the domain into the \"right\"\nsubdomains. Many mathematicians, including Terry Tao, have suggested that using\nAI tools to find the right decompositions can be very useful for research-level\nasymptotic analysis. In this paper, we show that our framework LLM+CAS turns\nout to be remarkably effective at proposing such decompositions via a\ncombination of a frontier LLM and a CAS. More precisely, we use an LLM to\nsuggest domain decomposition, and a CAS (such as Mathematica) that provides a\nverification of each piece axiomatically.

To\naddress this issue, this study introduces a two-stream network feature\nextraction and fusion perception strategy for vision-based tactile systems.\nThis strategy employs a distributed approach to extract internal and external\nobject features. It obtains depth map information through three-dimensional\nreconstruction while simultaneously acquiring hardness information by measuring\ncontact force data. After extracting features with a convolutional neural\nnetwork (CNN), weighted fusion is applied to create a more informative and\neffective feature representation. In standard tests on objects of varying\nshapes and hardness, the force prediction error is 0.06 N (within a 12 N\nrange). Hardness recognition accuracy reaches 98.0%, and shape recognition\naccuracy reaches 93.75%. With fusion algorithms, object recognition accuracy in\nactual grasping scenarios exceeds 98.5%.

To counteract this, our second pathway, Success-Driven\nQuality-Guided SFT, grounds the policy in holistic success. It identifies and\nselectively imitates high-quality successful trajectories, ensuring the agent\nremains aligned with the ultimate task goal. This pathway is strengthened by a\nconditional curriculum mechanism to aid initial exploration.\n  We conduct experiments in challenging manipulation tasks. The results\ndemonstrate that our framework achieves faster convergence and higher final\nsuccess rates compared to representative baselines.

Reinforcement Learning (RL), by contrast, can produce highly\nrobust behaviors through stochastic training but often lacks interpretability,\nsuffers from out-of-distribution failures, and requires intensive reward\nengineering. This work presents a GPU-parallelized residual architecture that\ntightly integrates MPC and RL by blending their outputs at the torque-control\nlevel. We develop a kinodynamic whole-body MPC formulation evaluated across\nthousands of agents in parallel at 100 Hz for RL training. The residual policy\nlearns to make targeted corrections to the MPC outputs, combining the\ninterpretability and constraint handling of model-based control with the\nadaptability of RL. The model-based control prior acts as a strong bias,\ninitializing and guiding the policy towards desirable behavior with a simple\nset of rewards.

Designing such a\ncost function can be very challenging, especially if a wide range of complex\nurban scenarios has to be considered.

We propose a method, CTRL-Rec, that allows\nfor natural language control of traditional recommender systems in real-time\nwith computational efficiency. Specifically, at training time, we use an LLM to\nsimulate whether users would approve of items based on their language requests,\nand we train embedding models that approximate such simulated judgments.

We show that even\nif a decision rule satisfies standard criteria of fairness, perceived\ndiscrimination can persist or even increase in the presence of homophily or\nassortative mixing. We propose a formalism for the concept of fairness\nperception, linking network structure, local observation, and social\nperception.
