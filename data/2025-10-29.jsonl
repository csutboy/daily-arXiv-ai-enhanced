However, these properties also pose\nsignificant challenges in designing the morphologies and controllers of soft\nrobots. The relatively short history of this field has not yet produced\nsufficient knowledge to consistently derive optimal solutions. Consequently, an\nautomated process for the design of soft robot morphologies can be extremely\nhelpful. This study focusses on the cooperative NeuroCoEvolution of networks\nthat are indirect representations of soft robot actuators. Both the\nmorphologies and controllers represented by Compositional Pattern Producing\nNetworks are evolved using the well-established method NeuroEvolution of\nAugmented Topologies (CPPN-NEAT). The CoEvolution of controllers and\nmorphologies is implemented using the top n individuals from the cooperating\npopulation, with various averaging methods tested to determine the fitness of\nthe evaluated individuals. The test-case application for this research is the\noptimisation of a soft actuator for a drug delivery system. The primary metric\nused is the maximum displacement of one end of the actuator in a specified\ndirection. Additionally, the robustness of the evolved morphologies is assessed\nagainst a range of randomly generated controllers to simulate potential noise\nin real-world applications. The results of this investigation indicate that\nCPPN-NEAT produces superior morphologies compared to previously published\nresults from multi-objective optimisation, with reduced computational effort\nand time. Moreover, the best configuration is found to be CoEvolution with the\ntwo best individuals from the cooperative population and the averaging of their\nfitness using the weighted mean method."}

However, the current R package\nlacks a user interface (UI), limiting its practical use in clinical settings.\nTherefore, we aim to develop a web-based UI for broader use of the Fam3PRO\nfunctionalities.\n  Methods: The Fam3PRO UI (F3PI), built with R Shiny, collects and formats\ninputs including family health history, genetic test results, and other risk\nfactors. Pedigree data are interactively visualized and modified via\npedigreejs, while the backend Fam3PRO model takes all the inputs to generate\ncarrier probabilities and future cancer risks, presented through an interactive\nUI.\n  Results: F3PI streamlines the collection of patient and family history data,\nwhich is analyzed by the Fam3PRO models to provide personalized cancer risks\nfor each proband across 18 cancers, as well as probabilities that a proband has\na PV in up to 22 hereditary cancer genes. These results are returned to the\nuser, within one minute on average and are available in both interactive and\ndownloadable formats.\n  Conclusion: We have developed F3PI, an easy-to-use, interactive web\napplication that makes cancer and genetic risk information more accessible to\nproviders and their patients."}

ME-POMDPs represent a finite set of POMDPs that share the\nsame state, action, and observation spaces, but may arbitrarily vary in their\ntransition, observation, and reward models. Such models arise, for instance,\nwhen multiple domain experts disagree on how to model a problem. The goal is to\nfind a single policy that is robust against any choice of POMDP within the set,\ni.e., a policy that maximizes the worst-case reward across all POMDPs. We\ngeneralize and expand on existing work in the following way. First, we show\nthat ME-POMDPs can be generalized to POMDPs with sets of initial beliefs, which\nwe call adversarial-belief POMDPs (AB-POMDPs). Second, we show that any\narbitrary ME-POMDP can be reduced to a ME-POMDP that only varies in its\ntransition and reward functions or only in its observation and reward\nfunctions, while preserving (optimal) policies. We then devise exact and\napproximate (point-based) algorithms to compute robust policies for AB-POMDPs,\nand thus ME-POMDPs.

The results show\nthat AI generated discourses from four models about Iran and China are the most\nhomogeneous and unchanging across all four models, including OpenAI GPT, Google\nGemini, Anthropic Claude, and DeepSeek, despite the prompted perspective change\nand the actual changes in real life. This study does not engage with history,\npolitics, or literature as traditional disciplinary approaches would; instead,\nit takes cues from international and area studies and offers insight on the\nfuture trajectory of shifting political discourse in a digital space\nincreasingly cannibalised by AI."}

Consequently, their rapid adoption in computational\npathology was expected to deliver comparable breakthroughs in cancer diagnosis,\nprognostication, and multimodal retrieval. However, recent systematic\nevaluations reveal fundamental weaknesses: low diagnostic accuracy, poor\nrobustness, geometric instability, heavy computational demands, and concerning\nsafety vulnerabilities. This short paper examines these shortcomings and argues\nthat they stem from deeper conceptual mismatches between the assumptions\nunderlying generic foundation modeling in mainstream AI and the intrinsic\ncomplexity of human tissue. Seven interrelated causes are identified:\nbiological complexity, ineffective self-supervision, overgeneralization,\nexcessive architectural complexity, lack of domain-specific innovation,\ninsufficient data, and a fundamental design flaw related to tissue patch size.\nThese findings suggest that current pathology foundation models remain\nconceptually misaligned with the nature of tissue morphology and call for a\nfundamental rethinking of the paradigm itself."}

This work addresses the problem of decentralized goal\nassignment for multi-agent path planning, where agents independently generate\nranked preferences over goals based on structured representations of the\nenvironment, including grid visualizations and scenario data. After this\nreasoning phase, agents exchange their goal rankings, and assignments are\ndetermined by a fixed, deterministic conflict-resolution rule (e.g., agent\nindex ordering), without negotiation or iterative coordination. We\nsystematically compare greedy heuristics, optimal assignment, and large\nlanguage model (LLM)-based agents in fully observable grid-world settings. Our\nresults show that LLM-based agents, when provided with well-designed prompts\nand relevant quantitative information, can achieve near-optimal makespans and\nconsistently outperform traditional heuristics. These findings underscore the\npotential of language models for decentralized goal assignment in multi-agent\npath planning and highlight the importance of information structure in such\nsystems."}

In\ncontrast to conventional graphical modeling tools (e.g., block diagrams and\nbond graphs), the adopted Energetic Macroscopic Representation (EMR) framework\noffers clear advantages by explicitly representing energy interactions and\nfacilitating the systematic derivation of control structures. A control\nstrategy developed within this framework governs energy flow across the\npowertrain, enabling accurate speed control via armature voltage regulation.\nExperimental tests conducted on a Lucas-Nulle test bench show strong\ncorrelation with simulation results. The study also introduces a methodology to\ncompute the maximum admissible vehicle mass - determined to be 13.5 kg for a\n180 W motor operating at 1900 rpm - based on acceleration and slope\nconstraints. Furthermore, a switching algorithm for the bidirectional converter\nensures reliable four quadrant operation. Overall, the proposed framework\nprovides a scalable and effective approach for EV emulation, control design,\nand energy management validation."}

One of the key challenges in achieving this goal is to enable these\nsystems to manipulate objects and tools in a manner that is similar to that of\nhumans. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for learning human-style\nmanipulation skills by using adversarial motion priors, which we name HMAMP.\nThe approach leverages adversarial networks to model the complex dynamics of\ntool and object manipulation, as well as the aim of the manipulation task. The\ndiscriminator is trained using a combination of real-world data and simulation\ndata executed by the agent, which is designed to train a policy that generates\nrealistic motion trajectories that match the statistical properties of human\nmotion. We evaluated HMAMP on one challenging manipulation task: hammering, and\nthe results indicate that HMAMP is capable of learning human-style manipulation\nskills that outperform current baseline methods.

The system (i) grows diverse, logically labeled evidence\nclusters through Natural Language Inference (NLI)-based relation typing and\ndiversity-aware expansion; (ii) applies reverse question construction to\ncompose oblique cues so that isolated signals are underinformative but their\ncombination uniquely identifies the target entity; and (iii) enforces quality\nwith a two-step evaluation pipeline that combines multi-model consensus\nfiltering with structured constraint decomposition and evidence-based matching.\nThe result is a scalable process that yields complex, retrieval-resistant yet\nverifiable questions suitable for SFT/RL training as well as challenging\nevaluation, substantially reducing human curation effort while preserving the\ndifficulty profile of strong evaluation benchmarks."}

The factorization converts the nested Bayesian\ndependency into a chain structure, enabling efficient parallel computation: at\nthe lower level, an invariant extended Kalman filter with state augmentation\nestimates trajectories, while a derivative filter computes analytical gradients\nin parallel for upper-level gradient updates.

Concretely, Orion\ndecomposes a single query reasoning process into two synergistic phases: (1)\n\\textit{key point generation}, which distills logically structured key points\nthrough retrieval-augmented few-shot prompting, and (2) \\textit{content\nparallel expansion}, which concurrently elaborates on these points based on a\ndependency graph to ensure logical consistency. Furthermore, Orion introduces a\npipeline scheduling mechanism that exploits the complementary computational\ncharacteristics of the two phases (generation imposes pressure on GPU computing\nand expansion stresses on GPU memory) across multiple queries, enabling\ncross-query parallelism and dramatically improving reasoning performance (\\ie,\nefficiency and quality). Experiments on diverse benchmarks show that Orion not\nonly delivers up to 4.33x higher token generation speed and 3.42x lower answer\nlatency over the baselines but also improves reasoning quality by up to 18.75%\nthrough explicitly modeling inter-point dependencies."}

Thus, unified models that operate\nseamlessly across digital and physical spaces while generalizing across\nembodiments and tasks remain absent. We introduce the \\textbf{Boundless Large\nModel (BLM$_1$)}, a multimodal spatial foundation model that preserves\ninstruction following and reasoning, incorporates embodied knowledge, and\nsupports robust cross-embodiment control. BLM$_1$ integrates three key\ncapabilities -- \\textit{cross-space transfer, cross-task learning, and\ncross-embodiment generalization} -- via a two-stage training paradigm.

If a doctor\never asks, \"Why?\", HistoLens can instantly provide a 'visual proof' for any\nfinding--a heatmap that points to the exact cells and regions the AI used for\nits analysis. We've also ensured the AI focuses only on the patient's tissue,\njust like a trained pathologist would, by teaching it to ignore distracting\nbackground noise. The result is a workflow where the pathologist remains the\nexpert in charge, using a trustworthy AI assistant to verify their insights and\nmake faster, more confident diagnoses."}

This is primarily\ndue to the absence of a designated ego vehicle and the associated sensor\ninputs, such as camera or LiDAR, typically provided in real-world scenarios. To\naddress this gap, we introduce SynAD, the first framework designed to enhance\nreal-world E2E AD models using synthetic data. Our method designates the agent\nwith the most comprehensive driving information as the ego vehicle in a\nmulti-agent synthetic scenario. We further project path-level scenarios onto\nmaps and employ a newly developed Map-to-BEV Network to derive bird's-eye-view\nfeatures without relying on sensor inputs.

Existing data synthesis methods,\nsuch as random environment sampling or multi-agent role-playing, are not\npowerful enough to generate high-quality data in real-world environments.\nPractical challenges come in three folds: targeted model training, isolation of\ntool architecture, and multi-turn logical dependency. To address these\nstructural deficiencies, we present FunReason-MT, a novel data synthesis\nframework for real-world multi-turn tool use. FunReason-MT resolves the\ncomplexity barrier in multi-turn FC data by employing 1) Environment-API Graph\nInteractions to gather varied high-quality trajectories, 2) Advanced Tool-Query\nSynthesis to simplify hard query construction, and 3) Guided Iterative Chain\nfor sophisticated CoT generation. Evaluations on Berkeley Function-Calling\nLeaderboard (BFCLv3) demonstrate the power of our framework: a 4B model built\nupon FunReason-MT generated data achieves state-of-the-art performance among\ncomparable-sized models, outperforming most close-source models. Further\nperformance improvements on BFCLv4 confirm that FunReason-MT provides a\nreliable and robust source for agentic learning."}

To showcase\nthe effectiveness of our method we compare three representative object-aware\ncontrollers. The comparison uses metrics originating from the design\nconsiderations.

We then employed multivariate techniques to identify latent task\narchetypes and analyzed their relationship with AI usage. Findings: Tasks\nrequiring high creativity, complexity, and cognitive demand, but low\nroutineness, attracted the most AI engagement.
