PhD programme: Quantitative Methods for Policy Evaluation (Cycle XXXVII). Supervisors: Rosaria Romano, Jamus Jerome Lim", "summary": "Timely assessment of current conditions is essential especially for small, open economies such as Singapore, where external shocks transmit rapidly to domestic activity. We develop a real-time nowcasting framework for quarterly GDP growth using a high-dimensional panel of approximately 70 indicators, encompassing economic and financial indicators over 1990Q1-2023Q2. The analysis covers penalized regressions, dimensionality-reduction methods, ensemble learning algorithms, and neural architectures, benchmarked against a Random Walk, an AR(3), and a Dynamic Factor Model. The pipeline preserves temporal ordering through an expanding-window walk-forward design with Bayesian hyperparameter optimization, and uses moving block-bootstrap procedures both to construct prediction intervals and to obtain confidence bands for feature-importance measures. It adopts model-specific and XAI-based explainability tools. A Model Confidence Set procedure identifies statistically superior learners, which are then combined through simple, weighted, and exponentially weighted schemes; the resulting time-varying weights provide an interpretable representation of model contributions. Predictive ability is assessed via Giacomini-White tests. Empirical results show that penalized regressions, dimensionality-reduction models, and GRU networks consistently outperform all benchmarks, with RMSFE reductions of roughly 40-60%; aggregation delivers further gains. Feature-attribution methods highlight industrial production, external trade, and labor-market indicators as dominant drivers of Singapore's short-run growth dynamics."}

To address this issue in multi-way gravity models, we propose a novel, asymptotically unbiased estimator. Our method reframes the estimation as a series of classification tasks and is agnostic to both the number and structure of fixed effects. In sparse data environments, common in the network formation literature, it is also computationally faster than PPML. We provide empirical evidence that our estimator yields more accurate point estimates and confidence intervals than PPML and its bias-correction strategies. These improvements hold even under model misspecification and are more pronounced in sparse settings. While PPML remains competitive in dense, low-dimensional data, our approach offers a robust alternative for multi-way models that scales efficiently with sparsity. The method is applied to estimate the effect of a policy reform on spatial accessibility to health care in France."}

Using third order cross moments, the paper constructs a three way tensor whose unique decomposition, guaranteed by Kruskal theorem, identifies the factor loading matrices. Starting with a linear structure, the paper recovers the full distribution of latent factors by constructing suitable measurements and applying scalar or multivariate versions of Kotlarski identity. As a result, the joint distribution of the latent vector and measurement errors is fully identified without requiring injective measurements, showing that multivariate latent structure can be recovered in broader settings than previously believed. Under injectivity, the paper also provides user-friendly testable conditions for identification. Finally, this paper provides general identification results for nonlinear models using a newly-defined generalized Kruskal rank - signal rank - of intergral operators. These results have wide applicability in empirical work involving noisy or indirect measurements, including factor models, survey data with reporting errors, mismeasured regressors in econometrics, and multidimensional latent-trait models in psychology and marketing, potentially enabling more robust estimation and interpretation when clean measurements are unavailable."}

However, current methods remain unreliable. Without a solid theoretical footing, the refinement process can wander; sometimes it settles, sometimes it loops back, and sometimes it breaks away from any stable trajectory. This work bridges this critical gap by developing an LLM-Verifier Convergence Theorem, providing the first formal framework with provable guarantees for termination and convergence. We model the interaction between the LLM and the verifier as a discrete-time Markov Chain, with state transitions determined by a key parameter: the error-reduction probability ($δ$). The procedure reaching the Verified state almost surely demonstrates that the program terminates for any $δ> 0$, with an expected iteration count bounded by $\\mathbb{E}[n] \\leq 4/δ$. We then stress-tested this prediction in an extensive empirical campaign comprising more than 90,000 trials. The empirical results match the theory with striking consistency. Every single run reached verification, and the convergence factor clustered tightly around $C_f\\approx$ 1.0. Consequently, the bound mirrors the system's actual behavior. The evidence is sufficiently robust to support dividing the workflow into three distinct operating zones: marginal, practical, and high-performance. Consequently, we establish the design thresholds with absolute confidence. Together, the theoretical guarantee and the experimental evidence provide a clearer architectural foundation for LLM-assisted verification. Heuristic tuning no longer has to be carried out by the system. Engineers gain a framework that supports predictable resource planning and performance budgeting, precisely what is needed before deploying these pipelines into safety-critical software environments."}

Recent neural network-based solutions to the CDMN task adopt a kind of representation fusion and global division paradigm: Each node is first learned a kind of layer-wise representations which are then fused for global community division. However, even with contrastive or attentive fusion mechanisms, the fused global representations often lack the discriminative power to capture structural nuances unique to each layer. In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm for the CDMN task: Layered Division and Global Allocation (LDGA). The core idea is to first perform layer-wise group division, based on which global community allocation is next performed. Concretely, LDGA employs a multi-head Transformer as the backbone representation encoder, where each head is for encoding node structural characteristics in each network layer. We integrate the Transformer with a community-latent encoder to capture community prototypes in each layer. A shared scorer performs layered division by generating layer-wise soft assignments, while global allocation assigns each node the community label with highest confidence across all layers to form the final consensus partition. We design a loss function that couples differentiable multilayer modularity with a cluster balance regularizer to train our model in an unsupervised manner. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world multilayer networks demonstrate that our LDGA outperforms the state-of-the-art competitors in terms of higher detected community modularities.

Despite the success achieved, current learning-based solutions regard community search, i.e., locating the best community for a given query, and community detection, i.e., partitioning the whole graph, as separate problems, necessitating task- and dataset-specific retraining. Such a strategy limits the applicability and generalization ability of the existing models. Additionally, these methods rely heavily on information from the target dataset, leading to suboptimal performance when supervision is limited or unavailable. To mitigate this limitation, we propose UniCom, a unified framework to solve both community search and detection tasks through knowledge transfer across multiple domains, thus alleviating the limitations of single-dataset learning. UniCom centers on a Domain-aware Specialization (DAS) procedure that adapts on the fly to unseen graphs or tasks, eliminating costly retraining while maintaining framework compactness with a lightweight prompt-based paradigm. This is empowered by a Universal Graph Learning (UGL) backbone, which distills transferable semantic and topological knowledge from multiple source domains via comprehensive pre-training. Both DAS and UGL are informed by local neighborhood signals and cohesive subgraph structures, providing consistent guidance throughout the framework. Extensive experiments on both tasks across 16 benchmark datasets and 22 baselines have been conducted to ensure a comprehensive and fair evaluation. UniCom consistently outperforms all state-of-the-art baselines across all tasks under settings with scarce or no supervision, while maintaining runtime efficiency."}

While this model has become an archetype of economic conceptualization that combines bounded rationality and myopic reasoning, the literature on its asymptotic behaviours has remained scarce. In this paper, we proceed to a mathematical analysis of the dynamics and its full characterization in the simplest case of homogeneous buyer populations. By using elements of the theory of cooperative dynamical systems, we prove that, independently of the number of sellers and parameters, for almost every initial condition, the subsequent trajectory must asymptotically approach a stationary state. Moreover, for simple enough distributions of the sellers' attractiveness, we determine all stationary states and their parameter-dependent stability. This analysis shows that in most cases, the asymptotic preferences are ordered as the attractiveness are. However, depending on the parameters, there also exist robust functioning modes in which those sellers with highest preference are not the ones that provide highest profit."}

However, these descriptive ('what-is') methods, while effective for identifying associations, are often insufficient for answering causal ('what-if') questions. Their application in such contexts often overlooks confounding and colliding variables, potentially leading to bias and suboptimal or incorrect decisions.\n  We advocate for explicitly distinguishing descriptive from interventional questions in human-factor analysis, and applying causal inference frameworks specifically to these problems to prevent methodological mismatches. This approach disentangles complex variable relationships and enables counterfactual reasoning. Using post-occupancy evaluation (POE) data from the Center for the Built Environment's (CBE) Occupant Survey as a demonstration case, we show how causal discovery reveals intervention hierarchies and directional relationships that traditional associational analysis misses. The systematic distinction between causally associated and independent variables, combined with intervention prioritization capabilities, offers broad applicability to complex human-centric systems, for example, in building science or ergonomics, where understanding intervention effects is critical for optimization and decision-making."}

Although realistic world models often have high computational demands, efficient modelling is usually possible by exploiting the fact that real-world scenarios tend to involve subcomponents that interact in a modular manner. In this paper, we explore this idea by developing a framework for decomposing complex world models represented by transducers, a class of models generalising POMDPs. Whereas the composition of transducers is well understood, our results clarify how to invert this process, deriving sub-transducers operating on distinct input-output subspaces, enabling parallelizable and interpretable alternatives to monolithic world modelling that can support distributed inference. Overall, these results lay a groundwork for bridging the structural transparency demanded by AI safety and the computational efficiency required for real-world inference."}

The question raised in this study is whether information dissemination in social networks is random or follows a discernible structure.

This study proposes two preferential models to explore how news spreads on social media. Specifically, we examine global and local preferential selection models and demonstrate that information dissemination aligns with these patterns. According to these two models, information flows are distributed through specific paths on networks. This suggests that new information tends to propagate along the same paths as previous news, with the specific pathways varying depending on the type of content. Finally, an examination of the propagation of political hashtags on Twitter confirms the existence of these paths that also emerge from the two preferential models."}

This paper examines the regulatory landscape of AI training data governance in major jurisdictions, including the EU, the United States, and the Asia-Pacific region. It also identifies critical gaps in enforcement mechanisms that threaten both creator rights and the sustainability of AI development. Through analysis of major cases we identified critical gaps in pre-training data filtering. Existing solutions such as transparency tools, perceptual hashing, and access control mechanisms address only specific aspects of the problem and cannot prevent initial copyright violations. We identify two fundamental challenges: pre-training license collection and content filtering, which faces the impossibility of comprehensive copyright management at scale, and verification mechanisms, which lack tools to confirm filtering prevented infringement. We propose a multilayered filtering pipeline that combines access control, content verification, machine learning classifiers, and continuous database cross-referencing to shift copyright protection from post-training detection to pre-training prevention. This approach offers a pathway toward protecting creator rights while enabling continued AI innovation."}

Results show human responses significantly outperform all LLMs in answering questions, and across all matrices of persona perception, with particularly large gaps in empathy and credibility. Furthermore, LLM-generated content exhibited a systematic bias along the lines of the ``Pollyanna Principle'', scoring measurably higher in positive sentiment ($Φ_{avg} = 5.99$ for LLMs vs. $5.60$ for Humans). These findings suggest that LLM personas do not accurately reflect the authentic experience of real people in resource-scarce environments.

While agents enable multi-step reasoning, persistent memory, and tool orchestration, deploying them indiscriminately leads to higher cost, complexity, and risk.\n  We present STRIDE (Systematic Task Reasoning Intelligence Deployment Evaluator), a framework that provides principled recommendations for selecting between three modalities: (i) direct LLM calls, (ii) guided AI assistants, and (iii) fully autonomous agentic AI. STRIDE integrates structured task decomposition, dynamism attribution, and self-reflection requirement analysis to produce an Agentic Suitability Score, ensuring that full agentic autonomy is reserved for tasks with inherent dynamism or evolving context.\n  Evaluated across 30 real-world tasks spanning SRE, compliance, and enterprise automation, STRIDE achieved 92% accuracy in modality selection, reduced unnecessary agent deployments by 45%, and cut resource costs by 37%. Expert validation over six months in SRE and compliance domains confirmed its practical utility, with domain specialists agreeing that STRIDE effectively distinguishes between tasks requiring simple LLM calls, guided assistants, or full agentic autonomy. This work reframes agent adoption as a necessity-driven design decision, ensuring autonomy is applied only when its benefits justify the costs."}

First, we show that FRTDs are strictly more informative than eigenvalue spectra, yet insufficient for complete graph identification, thus placing FRTD equivalence between cospectrality and isomorphism. Second, we argue that FRTD equivalence between nodes captures structural similarity. Third, we empirically demonstrate that the FRTD embedding outperforms manually designed graph metrics in network alignment tasks. Finally, we show that random networks that approximately match the FRTD of a desired target also preserve other salient features.

By emulating human-like perception and decision-making processes, these models can predict and adapt to dynamic environments. Existing methods typically map high-dimensional observations into compact latent spaces and learn optimal policies within these latent representations. However, prior work usually jointly learns ego-vehicle dynamics and environmental transition dynamics from the image input, leading to inefficiencies and a lack of robustness to variations in vehicle dynamics. To address these issues, we propose the Vehicle Dynamics embedded Dreamer (VDD) method, which decouples the modeling of ego-vehicle dynamics from environmental transition dynamics. This separation allows the world model to generalize effectively across vehicles with diverse parameters. Additionally, we introduce two strategies to further enhance the robustness of the learned policy: Policy Adjustment during Deployment (PAD) and Policy Augmentation during Training (PAT). Comprehensive experiments in simulated environments demonstrate that the proposed model significantly improves both driving performance and robustness to variations in vehicle dynamics, outperforming existing approaches."}

Using a sample of Chinese listed firms (2008-2023), we address sparse AI data with a novel pruned training window method, testing multiple machine learning models. We find that AI adoption consistently increases predictive accuracy, with the largest gains in recall rates for identifying distressed firms. Tree-based models and AI density metrics proved most effective. Crucially, models using longer histories outperformed those relying solely on recent \"AI-rich\" data. The analysis also identifies divergent adoption patterns, with healthy firms exhibiting earlier and higher AI uptake than distressed peers. These findings, while based on Chinese data, provide a framework for early-warning signals and demonstrate the broader potential of AI metrics as a stable, complementary risk indicator distinct from traditional accounting measures."}

Yet, many urban communities, especially those in informal settlements, remain disconnected from road networks. This study presents a road access deprivation model that combines a new accessibility metric, capturing how well buildings are connected to the road network, with road surface type data as a proxy for road quality. These two components together enable the classification of urban areas into low, medium, or high deprivation levels. The model was applied to Nairobi (Kenya), Lagos (Nigeria), and Kano (Nigeria) using open geospatial datasets. Across all three cities, the majority of built-up areas fall into the low and medium road access deprivation levels, while highly deprived areas are comparatively limited. However, the share of highly deprived areas varies substantially, ranging from only 11.8 % in Nairobi to 27.7 % in Kano. Model evaluation against community-sourced validation data indicates good performance for identifying low deprivation areas (F1 > 0.74), moderate accuracy for medium deprivation in Nairobi and Lagos (F1 > 0.52, lower in Kano), and more variable results for high deprivation (F1 ranging from 0.26 in Kano to 0.69 in Nairobi). Furthermore, analysis of grid cells with multiple validations showed strong agreement among community members, with disagreements occurring mainly between adjacent deprivation levels. Finally, we discussed two types of sources for disagreement with community validations: (1) misalignment between the conceptual model and community perceptions, and (2) the operationalization of the conceptual model. In summary, our road access deprivation modeling approach demonstrates promise as a scalable, interpretable tool for identifying disconnected areas and informing urban planning in data-scarce contexts."}

Our algorithm is based on a four-step procedure. We first generate a matrix of probabilities of connections between all firms in the economy using an augmented gravity model embedded in a logistic function that takes firm size as mass. The model is parameterized to allow for the probability of a link between two firms to depend not only on their sizes but also on flows across the sectors to which they belong. We then use a Bernoulli draw to construct a directed but unweighted random graph from the probability distribution generated by the logistic-gravity function. We make the graph aperiodic by adding self-loops and irreducible by adding links between Strongly Connected Components while limiting distortions to sectoral flows. We convert the unweighted network to a weighted network by solving a convex quadratic programming problem that minimizes the Euclidean norm of the weights. The solution preserves the observed firm sizes and sectoral flows within reasonable bounds, while limiting the strength of the self-loops. Computationally, the algorithm is O(N2) in the worst case, but it can be evaluated in O(N) via sector-wise binning of firm sizes, albeit with an approximation error. We implement the algorithm to reconstruct the full US production network with more than 5 million firms and 100 million buyer-seller connections. The reconstructed network exhibits topological properties consistent with small samples of the real US buyer-seller networks, including fat-tails in degree distribution, mild clustering, and near-zero reciprocity. We provide open-source code of the algorithm to enable researchers to reconstruct large-scale granular production networks from publicly available data."}

These scenarios are commonly formulated as multi-agent informative path planning (MAIPP), where multiple agents must coordinate to maximize information gain while operating under budget constraints. A central challenge in MAIPP is ensuring effective coordination while the belief over the environment evolves with incoming measurements. Recent learning-based approaches address this by using distributions over future positions as \"intent\" to support coordination. However, these autoregressive intent predictors are computationally expensive and prone to compounding errors. Inspired by the effectiveness of diffusion models as expressive, long-horizon policies, we propose AID, a fully decentralized MAIPP framework that leverages diffusion models to generate long-term trajectories in a non-autoregressive manner. AID first performs behavior cloning on trajectories produced by existing MAIPP planners and then fine-tunes the policy using reinforcement learning via Diffusion Policy Policy Optimization (DPPO). This two-stage pipeline enables the policy to inherit expert behavior while learning improved coordination through online reward feedback. Experiments demonstrate that AID consistently improves upon the MAIPP planners it is trained from, achieving up to 4x faster execution and 17% increased information gain, while scaling effectively to larger numbers of agents. Our implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/marmotlab/AID."}

This study quantitatively compared human responses with those of eight LLM-generated social personas (e.g., Male, Female, Muslim, Political Supporter) within a low-resource environment like Bangladesh, using culturally specific questions. Results show human responses significantly outperform all LLMs in answering questions, and across all matrices of persona perception, with particularly large gaps in empathy and credibility. Furthermore, LLM-generated content exhibited a systematic bias along the lines of the ``Pollyanna Principle'', scoring measurably higher in positive sentiment ($Φ_{avg} = 5.99$ for LLMs vs. $5.60$ for Humans). These findings suggest that LLM personas do not accurately reflect the authentic experience of real people in resource-scarce environments. It is essential to validate LLM personas against real-world human data to ensure their alignment and reliability before deploying them in social science research."}

However, given the extraordinarily large number of genes, assay endpoints, and chemicals of interest, available data are sparse, with dose-response curves missing for the vast majority of chemical-gene pairs. Although gene ontologies characterize similarity among genes with respect to known cellular functions and biological pathways, the sensitivity of various pathways to environmental contaminants remains unclear. We propose a novel Dose-Activity Response Tracking (DART) approach to predict the biological activity of chemicals across genes using information on chemical structural properties and gene ontologies within a Bayesian factor model. Designed to provide toxicologists with a flexible tool applicable across diverse HTS assay platforms, DART reveals the latent processes driving dose-response behavior and predicts new activity profiles for chemical-gene pairs lacking experimental data. We demonstrate the performance of DART through simulation studies and an application to a vast new multi-experiment data set consisting of dose-response observations generated by the exposure of HepG2 cells to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), where it provides actionable guidance for chemical prioritization and inference on the structural and functional mechanisms underlying assay activation."}

Traditional rational-agent models fail to capture human trust formation, which involves a complex synthesis of reason, character, and pre-rational intuition. This report introduces the Moral-Epistemic VIRtue informed (MEVIR) framework, a comprehensive descriptive model integrating three theoretical perspectives: (1) a procedural model describing evidence-gathering and reasoning chains; (2) Linda Zagzebski's virtue epistemology, characterizing intellectual disposition and character-driven processes; and (3) Extended Moral Foundations Theory (EMFT), explaining rapid, automatic moral intuitions that anchor reasoning. Central to the framework are ontological concepts - Truth Bearers, Truth Makers, and Ontological Unpacking-revealing that disagreements often stem from fundamental differences in what counts as admissible reality. MEVIR reframes cognitive biases as systematic failures in applying epistemic virtues and demonstrates how different moral foundations lead agents to construct separate, internally coherent \"trust lattices\". Through case studies on vaccination mandates and climate policy, the framework shows that political polarization represents deeper divergence in moral priors, epistemic authorities, and evaluative heuristics. The report analyzes how propaganda, psychological operations, and echo chambers exploit the MEVIR process. The framework provides foundation for a Decision Support System to augment metacognition, helping individuals identify biases and practice epistemic virtues. The report concludes by acknowledging limitations and proposing longitudinal studies for future research."}

TradeTrap targets four core components of autonomous trading agents: market intelligence, strategy formulation, portfolio and ledger handling, and trade execution, and evaluates their robustness under controlled system-level perturbations. All evaluations are conducted in a closed-loop historical backtesting setting on real US equity market data with identical initial conditions, enabling fair and reproducible comparisons across agents and attacks. Extensive experiments show that small perturbations at a single component can propagate through the agent decision loop and induce extreme concentration, runaway exposure, and large portfolio drawdowns across both agent types, demonstrating that current autonomous trading agents can be systematically misled at the system level.

Yet, this design process is typically led by monodisciplinary approaches, often overlooking interdisciplinary knowledge and the experiential knowledge of workers who will ultimately share tasks with these systems. To address this gap, we introduce the robotic capabilities framework, a vocabulary that enables transdisciplinary collaborations to meaningfully shape the future of work when robotic systems are integrated into the workplace. Rather than focusing on the internal workings of robots, the framework centers discussion on high-level capabilities, supporting dialogue around which elements of a task should remain human-led and which can be delegated to robots. We developed the framework through reflexive and iterative processes, and applied it in two distinct settings: by engaging roboticists in describing existing commercial robots using its vocabulary, and through a design activity with students working on robotics-related projects. The framework emerges as an intermediate-level knowledge artifact and a boundary object that bridges technical and experiential domains, guiding designers, empowering workers, and contributing to more just and collaborative futures of work."}

We develop a real-time nowcasting framework for quarterly GDP growth using a high-dimensional panel of approximately 70 indicators, encompassing economic and financial indicators over 1990Q1-2023Q2. The analysis covers penalized regressions, dimensionality-reduction methods, ensemble learning algorithms, and neural architectures, benchmarked against a Random Walk, an AR(3), and a Dynamic Factor Model. The pipeline preserves temporal ordering through an expanding-window walk-forward design with Bayesian hyperparameter optimization, and uses moving block-bootstrap procedures both to construct prediction intervals and to obtain confidence bands for feature-importance measures. It adopts model-specific and XAI-based explainability tools. A Model Confidence Set procedure identifies statistically superior learners, which are then combined through simple, weighted, and exponentially weighted schemes; the resulting time-varying weights provide an interpretable representation of model contributions. Predictive ability is assessed via Giacomini-White tests. Empirical results show that penalized regressions, dimensionality-reduction models, and GRU networks consistently outperform all benchmarks, with RMSFE reductions of roughly 40-60%; aggregation delivers further gains. Feature-attribution methods highlight industrial production, external trade, and labor-market indicators as dominant drivers of Singapore's short-run growth dynamics."}

The results show that economic growth has a significant impact in all models analyzed. However, the direction of this impact differs across ecosystem components. Economic growth is found to have a positive impact on agriculture and water resources. In these models, a 1% increase in GDP increases the agriculture and water resources indices by 0.074-0.672%. In contrast, economic growth has a negative impact on biodiversity and habitat, ecosystem services, fisheries, acid rain and total ecosystem vitality.

In this paper we consider a class of such systems with both uncertain dynamics and an unknown but strictly positive input gain, where the nonlinear uncertainty is characterized by bounds on the Jacobian with respect to the state variables. We explicitly construct a three-dimensional region for the PID gains that is sufficient to guarantee global stability and asymptotic tracking of constant references for all nonlinearities satisfying these Jacobian bounds. We then derive a corresponding necessary region, thereby revealing the inherent conservatism required to cope with worst-case uncertainties.

Yet despite these achievements, modern AI systems remain fundamentally limited in their ability to self-monitor, self-correct, and regulate their behavior autonomously in dynamic contexts. This paper identifies and analyzes seven core deficiencies that constrain contemporary AI models: the absence of intrinsic self-monitoring, lack of meta-cognitive awareness, fixed and non-adaptive learning mechanisms, inability to restructure goals, lack of representational maintenance, insufficient embodied feedback, and the absence of intrinsic agency. Alongside identifying these limitations, we also outline a forward-looking perspective on how AI may evolve beyond them through architectures that mirror neurocognitive principles. We argue that these structural limitations prevent current architectures, including deep learning and transformer-based systems, from achieving robust generalization, lifelong adaptability, and real-world autonomy. Drawing on a comparative analysis of artificial systems and biological cognition [7], and integrating insights from AI research, cognitive science, and neuroscience, we outline how these capabilities are absent in current models and why scaling alone cannot resolve them. We conclude by advocating for a paradigmatic shift toward cognitively grounded AI (cognitive autonomy) capable of self-directed adaptation, dynamic representation management, and intentional, goal-oriented behavior, paired with reformative oversight mechanisms [8] that ensure autonomous systems remain interpretable, governable, and aligned with human values."}

Standard imitation learning policies fail by averaging these distinct actions into a single, invalid action. In this paper, we introduce SAM2Grasp, a novel framework that resolves this issue by reformulating the task as a uni-modal, prompt-conditioned prediction problem. Our method leverages the frozen SAM2 model to use its powerful visual temporal tracking capability and introduces a lightweight, trainable action head that operates in parallel with its native segmentation head. This design allows for training only the small action head on pre-computed temporal-visual features from SAM2. During inference, an initial prompt, such as a bounding box provided by an upstream object detection model, designates the specific object to be grasped. This prompt conditions the action head to predict a unique, unambiguous grasp trajectory for that object alone. In all subsequent video frames, SAM2's built-in temporal tracking capability automatically maintains stable tracking of the selected object, enabling our model to continuously predict the grasp trajectory from the video stream without further external guidance. This temporal-prompted approach effectively eliminates ambiguity from the visuomotor policy. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that SAM2Grasp achieves state-of-the-art performance in cluttered, multi-object grasping tasks."}

However, current methods remain unreliable. Without a solid theoretical footing, the refinement process can wander; sometimes it settles, sometimes it loops back, and sometimes it breaks away from any stable trajectory. This work bridges this critical gap by developing an LLM-Verifier Convergence Theorem, providing the first formal framework with provable guarantees for termination and convergence. We model the interaction between the LLM and the verifier as a discrete-time Markov Chain, with state transitions determined by a key parameter: the error-reduction probability ($δ$). The procedure reaching the Verified state almost surely demonstrates that the program terminates for any $δ> 0$, with an expected iteration count bounded by $\\mathbb{E}[n] \\leq 4/δ$. We then stress-tested this prediction in an extensive empirical campaign comprising more than 90,000 trials. The empirical results match the theory with striking consistency. Every single run reached verification, and the convergence factor clustered tightly around $C_f\\approx$ 1.0. Consequently, the bound mirrors the system's actual behavior. The evidence is sufficiently robust to support dividing the workflow into three distinct operating zones: marginal, practical, and high-performance. Consequently, we establish the design thresholds with absolute confidence. Together, the theoretical guarantee and the experimental evidence provide a clearer architectural foundation for LLM-assisted verification. Heuristic tuning no longer has to be carried out by the system. Engineers gain a framework that supports predictable resource planning and performance budgeting, precisely what is needed before deploying these pipelines into safety-critical software environments."}

In addition, seven models were constructed to assess in detail the impact of economic growth on different dimensions of the ecosystem. The results show that economic growth has a significant impact in all models analyzed. However, the direction of this impact differs across ecosystem components. Economic growth is found to have a positive impact on agriculture and water resources. In these models, a 1% increase in GDP increases the agriculture and water resources indices by 0.074-0.672%. In contrast, economic growth has a negative impact on biodiversity and habitat, ecosystem services, fisheries, acid rain and total ecosystem vitality. In these models, a 1% increase in GDP reduces the indices of biodiversity and habitat, ecosystem services, fisheries, acid rain and total ecosystem vitality by 0.101-2.144%.

We explicitly construct a three-dimensional region for the PID gains that is sufficient to guarantee global stability and asymptotic tracking of constant references for all nonlinearities satisfying these Jacobian bounds. We then derive a corresponding necessary region, thereby revealing the inherent conservatism required to cope with worst-case uncertainties.

To address this issue in multi-way gravity models, we propose a novel, asymptotically unbiased estimator. Our method reframes the estimation as a series of classification tasks and is agnostic to both the number and structure of fixed effects. In sparse data environments, common in the network formation literature, it is also computationally faster than PPML. We provide empirical evidence that our estimator yields more accurate point estimates and confidence intervals than PPML and its bias-correction strategies. These improvements hold even under model misspecification and are more pronounced in sparse settings. While PPML remains competitive in dense, low-dimensional data, our approach offers a robust alternative for multi-way models that scales efficiently with sparsity. The method is applied to estimate the effect of a policy reform on spatial accessibility to health care in France."}

Current ethical frameworks in this domain often implicitly rely on contested functionalist assumptions, prioritize speculative AI welfare over concrete human interests, and lack coherent theoretical foundations. We address these limitations through a structured three-level framework grounded in philosophical uncertainty. At the foundational level, we establish five factual determinations about AI consciousness alongside human-centralism as our meta-ethical stance. These foundations logically entail three operational principles: presumption of no consciousness (placing the burden of proof on consciousness claims), risk prudence (prioritizing human welfare under uncertainty), and transparent reasoning (enabling systematic evaluation and adaptation). At the application level, the third component of our framework, we derive default positions on pressing ethical questions through a transparent logical process where each position can be explicitly traced back to our foundational commitments. Our approach balances philosophical rigor with practical guidance, distinguishes consciousness from anthropomorphism, and creates pathways for responsible evolution as scientific understanding advances, providing a human-centric foundation for navigating these profound ethical challenges."}

DialogGuard can be applied to diverse generative models through four LLM-as-a-judge pipelines, including single-agent scoring, dual-agent correction, multi-agent debate, and stochastic majority voting, grounded in a shared three-level rubric usable by both human annotators and LLM judges. Using PKU-SafeRLHF with human safety annotations, we show that multi-agent mechanisms detect psychosocial risks more accurately than non-LLM baselines and single-agent judging; dual-agent correction and majority voting provide the best trade-off between accuracy, alignment with human ratings, and robustness, while debate attains higher recall but over-flags borderline cases.

From monocular RGB or RGB-D inputs, we perform high precision HOI reconstruction and enforce physical plausibility via a reinforcement learning (RL) optimizer that refines hand object relative poses under contact and penetration constraints. The reconstructed, contact rich trajectories are then retargeted to cross-embodiments, robot arms with simple end effectors, dexterous hands, and humanoids, yielding executable actions and rollouts. To scale coverage, we build a simulation-augmented framework on Isaac Sim with diverse domain randomization (embodiments, trajectories, object retrieval, background textures, hand motion mirroring), which enriches the distributions of trajectories and observations while preserving spatial relationships and physical plausibility. The entire data pipeline forms an end to end pipeline from video,reconstruction,retargeting,augmentation data acquisition. We validate the data on mainstream vision language action (VLA) and imitation learning architectures, demonstrating that trajectories produced by our pipeline are as stable as those from teleoperation and yield comparable continual performance gains. To our knowledge, this provides the first quantitative evidence that HOI modalities can serve as effective supervision for robotic learning. Compared with teleoperation, Robowheel is lightweight, a single monocular RGB(D) camera is sufficient to extract a universal, embodiment agnostic motion representation that could be flexibly retargeted across embodiments.

Although differential flatness simplifies planning and control for isolated subsystems, the presence of coupling can destroy this property for the overall joint system. Focusing on subsystems in pure-feedback form, we identify a class of compatible lower-triangular dynamic couplings that preserve flatness and guarantee that the flat outputs of the subsystems remain the flat outputs of the coupled system. Further, we show that the joint flatness diffeomorphism can be constructed from those of the individual subsystems and, crucially, its sparsity structure reflects that of the coupling. Exploiting this structure, we synthesize a distributed tracking controller that computes control actions from local information only, thereby ensuring scalability. We validate our proposed framework on a simulated example of planar quadrotors dynamically coupled via aerodynamic downwash, and show that the distributed controller achieves accurate trajectory tracking."}

The prediction module adopts cognitive representations of interaction modes based on topological motion semantics and nearest neighbor relational encoding. With a differentiable modal loss and multimodal Gaussian decoding, CogDrive learns sparse and unbalanced interaction behaviors and improves long horizon trajectory prediction. The planning module incorporates an emergency response concept and optimizes safety stabilized trajectories, where short term consistent branches ensure safety during replanning cycles and long term branches support smooth and collision free motion under low probability switching modes. Experiments on Argoverse2 and INTERACTION datasets show that CogDrive achieves strong performance in trajectory accuracy and miss rate, while closed loop simulations confirm adaptive behavior in merge and intersection scenarios.

AI systems increase the speed and clarity of managerial decisions, yet implementation faces challenges. The most frequent barriers include employee resistance, high costs, and regulatory ambiguity. Respondents indicate that organizational factors are more significant than technological limitations. Critical competencies for successful AI use include understanding algorithmic mechanisms and change management. Technical skills such as programming play a smaller role. Employees report difficulties in adapting to AI tools, especially when formulating prompts or accepting system outputs. The study highlights the importance of integrating AI with human judgment and communication practices. When supported by adaptive leadership and transparent processes, AI adoption enhances organizational agility and strengthens decision-making performance. These findings contribute to ongoing research on how digital technologies reshape management and the evolution of hybrid human-machine decision environments."}

The desired control law, obtained using partial differential equations and backstepping control, contains an integral term that has to be approximated for implementation. In this article, we propose a new way to implement this control law using a dynamic controller. The control law is composed of a state feedback term and a dynamic term that approaches the integral term that has to be estimated for implementation. Using a Lyapunov functional, we provide sufficient conditions, in terms of a linear matrix inequality, to guarantee that the closed-loop system is stable when the proposed control law is applied. We use three examples, taken from the literature, to show the benefits of the proposed approach."}

We address this critical challenge by achieving 95.5% Dice score using just 599 training images for breast cell segmentation, where just 4% of pixels represent breast tissue and 60% of images contain no breast regions. Our framework uses quantum-inspired edge enhancement via multi-scale Gabor filters creating a fourth input channel, enhancing boundary detection where inter-annotator variations reach +/- 3 pixels. We present a stabilized multi-component loss function that integrates adaptive Dice loss with boundary-aware terms and automatic positive weighting to effectively address severe class imbalance, where mammary epithelial cell regions comprise only 0.1%-20% of the total image area. Additionally, a complexity-based weighted sampling strategy is introduced to prioritize the challenging mammary epithelial cell regions. The model employs an EfficientNet-B7/UNet++ architecture with a 4-to-3 channel projection, enabling the use of pretrained weights despite limited medical imaging data. Finally, robust validation is achieved through exponential moving averaging and statistical outlier detection, ensuring reliable performance estimates on a small validation set (129 images). Our framework achieves a Dice score of 95.5% +/- 0.3% and an IoU of 91.2% +/- 0.4%. Notably, quantum-based enhancement contributes to a 2.1% improvement in boundary accuracy, while weighted sampling increases small lesion detection by 3.8%. By achieving groundbreaking performance with limited annotations, our approach significantly reduces the medical expert time required for dataset creation, addressing a fundamental bottleneck in clinical perception AI development."}

Our framework utilizes explicit visual symbols to enhance annotation efficiency. We further release the ViFailback dataset, a large-scale collection of 58,126 Visual Question Answering (VQA) pairs along with their corresponding 5,202 real-world manipulation trajectories.

To demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, we built the ViFailback-8B VLM, which not only achieves significant overall performance improvement on ViFailback-Bench but also generates visual symbols for corrective action guidance.

Yet, many urban communities, especially those in informal settlements, remain disconnected from road networks. This study presents a road access deprivation model that combines a new accessibility metric, capturing how well buildings are connected to the road network, with road surface type data as a proxy for road quality. These two components together enable the classification of urban areas into low, medium, or high deprivation levels. The model was applied to Nairobi (Kenya), Lagos (Nigeria), and Kano (Nigeria) using open geospatial datasets. Across all three cities, the majority of built-up areas fall into the low and medium road access deprivation levels, while highly deprived areas are comparatively limited. However, the share of highly deprived areas varies substantially, ranging from only 11.8 % in Nairobi to 27.7 % in Kano. Model evaluation against community-sourced validation data indicates good performance for identifying low deprivation areas (F1 > 0.74), moderate accuracy for medium deprivation in Nairobi and Lagos (F1 > 0.52, lower in Kano), and more variable results for high deprivation (F1 ranging from 0.26 in Kano to 0.69 in Nairobi). Furthermore, analysis of grid cells with multiple validations showed strong agreement among community members, with disagreements occurring mainly between adjacent deprivation levels. Finally, we discussed two types of sources for disagreement with community validations: (1) misalignment between the conceptual model and community perceptions, and (2) the operationalization of the conceptual model. In summary, our road access deprivation modeling approach demonstrates promise as a scalable, interpretable tool for identifying disconnected areas and informing urban planning in data-scarce contexts."}

Prior guardrail research largely targets unimodal settings and typically frames safeguarding as binary classification, which limits robustness across diverse modalities and tasks. To address this gap, we propose OmniGuard, the first family of omni-modal guardrails that performs safeguarding across all modalities with deliberate reasoning ability. To support the training of OMNIGUARD, we curate a large, comprehensive omni-modal safety dataset comprising over 210K diverse samples, with inputs that cover all modalities through both unimodal and cross-modal samples. Each sample is annotated with structured safety labels and carefully curated safety critiques from expert models through targeted distillation. Extensive experiments on 15 benchmarks show that OmniGuard achieves strong effectiveness and generalization across a wide range of multimodal safety scenarios. Importantly, OmniGuard provides a unified framework that enforces policies and mitigates risks in omni-modalities, paving the way toward building more robust and capable omnimodal safeguarding systems."}

This research introduces the LangGraph-based Task Allocation Agent (LTAA), an LLM-driven framework that integrates phase-adaptive allocation strategies, multi-stage validation with hierarchical retries, and dynamic prompting for efficient robot coordination. Although recent LLM approaches show potential for construction robotics, they largely lack rigorous validation and benchmarking against established algorithms. This paper presents the first systematic comparison of LLM-based task allocation with traditional methods in construction scenarios.The study validates LLM feasibility through SMART-LLM replication and addresses implementation challenges using a Self-Corrective Agent Architecture. LTAA leverages natural-language reasoning combined with structured validation mechanisms, achieving major computational gains reducing token usage by 94.6% and allocation time by 86% through dynamic prompting. The framework adjusts its strategy across phases: emphasizing execution feasibility early and workload balance in later allocations.The authors evaluate LTAA against Dynamic Programming, Q-learning, and Deep Q-Network (DQN) baselines using construction operations from the TEACh human-robot collaboration dataset. In the Heavy Excels setting, where robots have strong task specializations, LTAA achieves 77% task completion with superior workload balance, outperforming all traditional methods. These findings show that LLM-based reasoning with structured validation can match established optimization algorithms while offering additional advantages such as interpretability, adaptability, and the ability to update task logic without retraining."}

Although realistic world models often have high computational demands, efficient modelling is usually possible by exploiting the fact that real-world scenarios tend to involve subcomponents that interact in a modular manner. In this paper, we explore this idea by developing a framework for decomposing complex world models represented by transducers, a class of models generalising POMDPs. Whereas the composition of transducers is well understood, our results clarify how to invert this process, deriving sub-transducers operating on distinct input-output subspaces, enabling parallelizable and interpretable alternatives to monolithic world modelling that can support distributed inference. Overall, these results lay a groundwork for bridging the structural transparency demanded by AI safety and the computational efficiency required for real-world inference."}

However, current vision-language models (VLMs) struggle to maintain geometric coherence and cross-view consistency for spatial reasoning in multi-view settings. We attribute this gap to the lack of fine-grained benchmarks that isolate multi-view reasoning from single-view perception and temporal factors. To address this, we present ReMindView-Bench, a cognitively grounded benchmark for evaluating how VLMs construct, align and maintain spatial mental models across complementary viewpoints. ReMindView-Bench systematically varies viewpoint spatial pattern and query type to probe key factors of spatial cognition. Evaluations of 15 current VLMs reveals consistent failures in cross-view alignment and perspective-taking in multi-view spatial reasoning, motivating deeper analysis on the reasoning process. Explicit phase-wise analysis using LLM-as-a-judge and self-consistency prompting shows that VLMs perform well on in-frame perception but degrade sharply when integrating information across views. Implicit analysis, including linear probing and entropy dynamics, further show progressive loss of task-relevant information and uncertainty separation between correct and incorrect trajectories. These results provide a cognitively grounded diagnosis of VLM spatial reasoning and reveal how multi-view spatial mental models are formed, degraded and destabilized across reasoning phases.

Yang Zhang leads the whole project", "summary": "Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, trained via flow-matching or diffusion objectives, excel at learning complex behaviors from large-scale, multi-modal datasets (e.g., human teleoperation, scripted policies). However, since VLAs incorporate diverse data modes in the pre-training stage, and the finetuning dataset often contains demonstration data collected in a kinematically suboptimal or undesirable way, it exists redundant action modes that are irrelevant to the success action modes of the downstream task. Specifically, we observe a critical inference-time fragility among various sampled noises after supervised finetuning of pre-trained VLAs. In this paper, we attribute this instability to the distribution shift between the VLA policy and the policy induced by stable success modes of the downstream task dataset. Thus, we propose \\textbf{TACO}, a test-time-scaling (TTS) framework that applies a lightweight pseudo-count estimator as a high-fidelity verifier of action chunks. The VLA models integrated with TACO can execute the actions with maximum pseudo-count from all sampled action chunks, thereby preventing distribution shifts while preserving the generalization ability of VLAs since the constraint is applied only during inference. Our method resembles the classical anti-exploration principle in offline reinforcement learning (RL), and being gradient-free, it incurs significant computational benefits compared to RL update, especially for flow or diffusion-based VLAs which are difficult to perform RL update due to denoising process. Extensive experiments across four simulation benchmarks (RoboTwin2.0, Robotwin, LIBERO, SimplerEnv) and a dual-arm platform demonstrate that our method significantly improves the inference stability and success rates in downstream-task adaptations."}

STRIDE integrates structured task decomposition, dynamism attribution, and self-reflection requirement analysis to produce an Agentic Suitability Score, ensuring that full agentic autonomy is reserved for tasks with inherent dynamism or evolving context.\n  Evaluated across 30 real-world tasks spanning SRE, compliance, and enterprise automation, STRIDE achieved 92% accuracy in modality selection, reduced unnecessary agent deployments by 45%, and cut resource costs by 37%. Expert validation over six months in SRE and compliance domains confirmed its practical utility, with domain specialists agreeing that STRIDE effectively distinguishes between tasks requiring simple LLM calls, guided assistants, or full agentic autonomy.

To address these limitations, we propose a generative agent-based MMO simulation system empowered by Large Language Models (LLMs).

However, safety-critical scenarios that can effectively expose system vulnerabilities are extremely sparse in the real world. Existing scenario generation methods face challenges in efficiently constructing long-tail scenarios that ensure fidelity, criticality, and interactivity, while particularly lacking real-time dynamic response capabilities to the vehicle under test (VUT). To address these challenges, this paper proposes a safety-critical testing scenario generation framework that integrates the high-level semantic understanding capabilities of Vision Language Models (VLMs) with the fine-grained generation capabilities of adaptive guided diffusion models. The framework establishes a three-layer hierarchical architecture comprising a strategic layer for VLM-directed scenario generation objective determination, a tactical layer for guidance function formulation, and an operational layer for guided diffusion execution. We first establish a high-quality fundamental diffusion model that learns the data distribution of real driving scenarios. Next, we design an adaptive guided diffusion method that enables real-time, precise control of background vehicles (BVs) in closed-loop simulation. The VLM is then incorporated to autonomously generate scenario generation objectives and guidance functions through deep scenario understanding and risk reasoning, ultimately guiding the diffusion model to achieve VLM-directed scenario generation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can efficiently generate realistic, diverse, and highly interactive safety-critical testing scenarios. Furthermore, case studies validate the adaptability and VLM-directed generation performance of the proposed method."}

Inspired by techniques from autonomous driving and robotics, we investigate whether supervised learning with synthetic error injection can induce self-correction abilities in language models. Our approach inserts artificial errors into reasoning chains, masks them, and supervises the model to recognize and correct these mistakes. Despite the intuitive appeal of this method, we find that it fails to significantly improve performance even on simple synthetic tasks across multiple models. Moreover, even when the model catches its own error, it often parrots the original mistake. We find that the distribution shift of synthetic errors to on-policy errors significantly degrades the error-correction capabilities of the fine-tuned model, even with good synthetic coverage of on-policy errors. Our results help explain why on-policy reinforcement learning methods have proven uniquely effective for eliciting self-correction."}

Yet in practice, unguided self-evolving systems often plateau quickly or even degrade as training progresses. These failures arise from issues such as concept drift, diversity collapse, and mis-evolution, as models reinforce their own biases and converge toward low-entropy behaviors. To enable models to self-evolve in a stable and controllable manner while minimizing reliance on human supervision, we introduce R-Few, a guided Self-Play Challenger-Solver framework that incorporates lightweight human oversight through in-context grounding and mixed training. At each iteration, the Challenger samples a small set of human-labeled examples to guide synthetic question generation, while the Solver jointly trains on human and synthetic examples under an online, difficulty-based curriculum. Across math and general reasoning benchmarks, R-Few achieves consistent and iterative improvements. For example, Qwen3-8B-Base improves by +3.0 points over R-Zero on math tasks and achieves performance on par with General-Reasoner, despite the latter being trained on 20 times more human data. Ablation studies confirm the complementary contributions of grounded challenger training and curriculum-based solver training, and further analysis shows that R-Few mitigates drift, yielding more stable and controllable co-evolutionary dynamics."}

Yet despite these achievements, modern AI systems remain fundamentally limited in their ability to self-monitor, self-correct, and regulate their behavior autonomously in dynamic contexts. This paper identifies and analyzes seven core deficiencies that constrain contemporary AI models: the absence of intrinsic self-monitoring, lack of meta-cognitive awareness, fixed and non-adaptive learning mechanisms, inability to restructure goals, lack of representational maintenance, insufficient embodied feedback, and the absence of intrinsic agency. Alongside identifying these limitations, we also outline a forward-looking perspective on how AI may evolve beyond them through architectures that mirror neurocognitive principles. We argue that these structural limitations prevent current architectures, including deep learning and transformer-based systems, from achieving robust generalization, lifelong adaptability, and real-world autonomy. Drawing on a comparative analysis of artificial systems and biological cognition [7], and integrating insights from AI research, cognitive science, and neuroscience, we outline how these capabilities are absent in current models and why scaling alone cannot resolve them. We conclude by advocating for a paradigmatic shift toward cognitively grounded AI (cognitive autonomy) capable of self-directed adaptation, dynamic representation management, and intentional, goal-oriented behavior, paired with reformative oversight mechanisms [8] that ensure autonomous systems remain interpretable, governable, and aligned with human values."}

Recent methods employ video diffusion models (VDMs) to enhance robotic policies, improving their understanding and modeling of the physical world. However, existing approaches overlook the coherent and physically consistent motion representations inherently encoded across frames in VDMs. To this end, we propose Video2Act, a framework that efficiently guides robotic action learning by explicitly integrating spatial and motion-aware representations. Building on the inherent representations of VDMs, we extract foreground boundaries and inter-frame motion variations while filtering out background noise and task-irrelevant biases. These refined representations are then used as additional conditioning inputs to a diffusion transformer (DiT) action head, enabling it to reason about what to manipulate and how to move. To mitigate inference inefficiency, we propose an asynchronous dual-system design, where the VDM functions as the slow System 2 and the DiT head as the fast System 1, working collaboratively to generate adaptive actions. By providing motion-aware conditions to System 1, Video2Act maintains stable manipulation even with low-frequency updates from the VDM. For evaluation, Video2Act surpasses previous state-of-the-art VLA methods by 7.7% in simulation and 21.7% in real-world tasks in terms of average success rate, further exhibiting strong generalization capabilities."}

DialogGuard can be applied to diverse generative models through four LLM-as-a-judge pipelines, including single-agent scoring, dual-agent correction, multi-agent debate, and stochastic majority voting, grounded in a shared three-level rubric usable by both human annotators and LLM judges. Using PKU-SafeRLHF with human safety annotations, we show that multi-agent mechanisms detect psychosocial risks more accurately than non-LLM baselines and single-agent judging; dual-agent correction and majority voting provide the best trade-off between accuracy, alignment with human ratings, and robustness, while debate attains higher recall but over-flags borderline cases.

The method comprises the Multi-Modal Empathy Prediction and Supervisory Documentation Assisted Training. We use pre-trained networks in the empathy prediction network to extract features from various modalities, followed by a cross-modal fusion. This process yields a multi-modal feature representation, which is employed to predict empathy labels. To enhance the extraction of text features, we incorporate supervisory documents as privileged information during the assisted training phase. Specifically, we apply the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model to identify potential topic distributions to constrain text features. These supervisory documents, created by supervisors, focus on the counseling topics and the counselor's display of empathy.

Human operators face a fundamental attentional bottleneck: they cannot simultaneously control drone operations and monitor vigilance states across entire animal groups. By the time elevated vigilance becomes obvious, an adverse flee response by the animals may be unavoidable. To solve this challenge, we present an edge-native, behavior-adaptive drone system for wildlife monitoring. This configurable decision-support system augments operator expertise with automated group-level vigilance monitoring. Our system continuously tracks individual behaviors using YOLOv11m detection and YOLO-Behavior classification, aggregates vigilance states into a real-time group stress metric, and provides graduated alerts (alert vigilance to flee response) with operator-tunable thresholds for context-specific calibration. We derive service-level objectives (SLOs) from video frame rates and behavioral dynamics: to monitor 30fps video streams in real-time, our system must complete detection and classification within 33ms per frame. Our edge-native pipeline achieves 23.8ms total inference on GPU-accelerated hardware, meeting this constraint with a substantial margin. Retrospective analysis of seven wildlife monitoring missions demonstrates detection capability and quantifies the cost of reactive control: manual piloting results in 14 seconds average adverse behavior duration with 71.9% usable frames. Our analysis reveals operators could have received actionable alerts 51s before animals fled in 57% of missions. Simulating 5-second operator intervention yields a projected performance of 82.8% usable frames with 1-second adverse behavior duration,a 93% reduction compared to manual piloting."}

This allows it to scale its organizational complexity to match open-ended tasks. To mitigate the error propagation inherent in unidirectional function calls, IACT introduces interactional redundancy by replacing rigid invocations with bidirectional, stateful dialogues.

Data-driven RUL prediction techniques have demonstrated commendable performance.

To mitigate this domain discrepancy issue, prior adversarial domain adaptation methods focused on deriving domain-invariant features. Nevertheless, they overlook target-specific information and inconsistency characteristics pertinent to the degradation stages, resulting in suboptimal performance. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel domain adaptation approach for cross-domain RUL prediction named TACDA. Specifically, we propose a target domain reconstruction strategy within the adversarial adaptation process, thereby retaining target-specific information while learning domain-invariant features. Furthermore, we develop a novel clustering and pairing strategy for consistent alignment between similar degradation stages.

We address this critical challenge by achieving 95.5% Dice score using just 599 training images for breast cell segmentation, where just 4% of pixels represent breast tissue and 60% of images contain no breast regions. Our framework uses quantum-inspired edge enhancement via multi-scale Gabor filters creating a fourth input channel, enhancing boundary detection where inter-annotator variations reach +/- 3 pixels. We present a stabilized multi-component loss function that integrates adaptive Dice loss with boundary-aware terms and automatic positive weighting to effectively address severe class imbalance, where mammary epithelial cell regions comprise only 0.1%-20% of the total image area. Additionally, a complexity-based weighted sampling strategy is introduced to prioritize the challenging mammary epithelial cell regions. The model employs an EfficientNet-B7/UNet++ architecture with a 4-to-3 channel projection, enabling the use of pretrained weights despite limited medical imaging data. Finally, robust validation is achieved through exponential moving averaging and statistical outlier detection, ensuring reliable performance estimates on a small validation set (129 images). Our framework achieves a Dice score of 95.5% +/- 0.3% and an IoU of 91.2% +/- 0.4%.

However, existing approaches fall short in environments where multiple high-level events (i.e., atomic propositions) can be true at the same time and potentially interact in complicated ways.

To address this gap, we propose OmniGuard, the first family of omni-modal guardrails that performs safeguarding across all modalities with deliberate reasoning ability. To support the training of OMNIGUARD, we curate a large, comprehensive omni-modal safety dataset comprising over 210K diverse samples, with inputs that cover all modalities through both unimodal and cross-modal samples. Each sample is annotated with structured safety labels and carefully curated safety critiques from expert models through targeted distillation. Extensive experiments on 15 benchmarks show that OmniGuard achieves strong effectiveness and generalization across a wide range of multimodal safety scenarios.

While prior research has extensively studied length generalization (a model's ability to handle longer sequences than seen during training), we investigate a distinct and underexplored limitation: depth generalization. Here, depth refers to the number of nested levels in a hierarchical problem, such as the layers of parentheses in a mathematical expression or the nesting of logical clauses in a Boolean formula. Our work reveals that standard transformer architectures struggle with problems involving deeper recursion than encountered during training, even when they perform well on longer but non-nested sequences. This limitation stems from their inability to maintain stack-like behavior, the capacity to track and resolve multiple levels of nested dependencies. Through systematic analysis, we demonstrate how this architectural constraint leads to rapid performance decay as the depth of the recursion increases. To address this challenge, we develop a novel looped locate-and-replace pipeline that decomposes recursive problems into manageable subcomponents. The approach employs two specialized models: a locator that identifies solvable subexpressions and a replacer that evaluates these components while preserving the overall structure. We evaluated this method in three carefully designed domains: Boolean algebra, recursive arithmetic, and propositional logic, each with a controllable depth of recursion. We show that our method effectively alleviates the performance decay when tested on out-of-distribution recursion depth."}

Traditional rational-agent models fail to capture human trust formation, which involves a complex synthesis of reason, character, and pre-rational intuition. This report introduces the Moral-Epistemic VIRtue informed (MEVIR) framework, a comprehensive descriptive model integrating three theoretical perspectives: (1) a procedural model describing evidence-gathering and reasoning chains; (2) Linda Zagzebski's virtue epistemology, characterizing intellectual disposition and character-driven processes; and (3) Extended Moral Foundations Theory (EMFT), explaining rapid, automatic moral intuitions that anchor reasoning. Central to the framework are ontological concepts - Truth Bearers, Truth Makers, and Ontological Unpacking-revealing that disagreements often stem from fundamental differences in what counts as admissible reality. MEVIR reframes cognitive biases as systematic failures in applying epistemic virtues and demonstrates how different moral foundations lead agents to construct separate, internally coherent \"trust lattices\". Through case studies on vaccination mandates and climate policy, the framework shows that political polarization represents deeper divergence in moral priors, epistemic authorities, and evaluative heuristics. The report analyzes how propaganda, psychological operations, and echo chambers exploit the MEVIR process. The framework provides foundation for a Decision Support System to augment metacognition, helping individuals identify biases and practice epistemic virtues. The report concludes by acknowledging limitations and proposing longitudinal studies for future research."}

Although existing methods have advanced emotion understanding, they often suffer from reasoning drift: models gradually rely on their own generated text instead of multimodal evidence, and their explanations are overly shaped by visually initiated reasoning paths. To address these issues, we introduce Modality Importance (MI), a simple yet effective mechanism for identifying the emotion-dominant modality. Using MI, MIGR reorganizes reasoning sequences so that explanations begin from the modality most critical to the target emotion, preventing early reasoning from being misled by less informative cues. Our two-stage framework-comprising modality-aligned supervised fine-tuning and modality-aware reward optimization-encourages models to generate emotionally grounded, causally relevant, and coherence-preserving explanations.

Recent neural network-based solutions to the CDMN task adopt a kind of representation fusion and global division paradigm: Each node is first learned a kind of layer-wise representations which are then fused for global community division. However, even with contrastive or attentive fusion mechanisms, the fused global representations often lack the discriminative power to capture structural nuances unique to each layer. In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm for the CDMN task: Layered Division and Global Allocation (LDGA). The core idea is to first perform layer-wise group division, based on which global community allocation is next performed. Concretely, LDGA employs a multi-head Transformer as the backbone representation encoder, where each head is for encoding node structural characteristics in each network layer. We integrate the Transformer with a community-latent encoder to capture community prototypes in each layer. A shared scorer performs layered division by generating layer-wise soft assignments, while global allocation assigns each node the community label with highest confidence across all layers to form the final consensus partition. We design a loss function that couples differentiable multilayer modularity with a cluster balance regularizer to train our model in an unsupervised manner. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world multilayer networks demonstrate that our LDGA outperforms the state-of-the-art competitors in terms of higher detected community modularities.

We attribute this gap to the lack of fine-grained benchmarks that isolate multi-view reasoning from single-view perception and temporal factors. To address this, we present ReMindView-Bench, a cognitively grounded benchmark for evaluating how VLMs construct, align and maintain spatial mental models across complementary viewpoints. ReMindView-Bench systematically varies viewpoint spatial pattern and query type to probe key factors of spatial cognition. Evaluations of 15 current VLMs reveals consistent failures in cross-view alignment and perspective-taking in multi-view spatial reasoning, motivating deeper analysis on the reasoning process. Explicit phase-wise analysis using LLM-as-a-judge and self-consistency prompting shows that VLMs perform well on in-frame perception but degrade sharply when integrating information across views. Implicit analysis, including linear probing and entropy dynamics, further show progressive loss of task-relevant information and uncertainty separation between correct and incorrect trajectories. These results provide a cognitively grounded diagnosis of VLM spatial reasoning and reveal how multi-view spatial mental models are formed, degraded and destabilized across reasoning phases.

It structures news into events and mines them along two dimensions: horizontal consolidation integrates daily events, while longitudinal tracking captures event evolution to extract incremental information reflecting market expectation discrepancies. This builds a temporal event knowledge base. By analyzing event-price dynamics, the framework further forms a reflection knowledge base of causal experiences. For prediction, it retrieves analogous historical scenarios and reasons with current events, incremental data, and past experiences.

We prove that this operator generates a vector field on the parameter manifold $Θ$, and we identify the coefficient of self-improvement $κ$ as the Lie derivative of the capability functional along this flow.\n  The central contribution of this work is the derivation of the Variance Inequality, a spectral condition that is sufficient (under mild regularity) for the stability of self-improvement.

The model incorporates heterogeneous MFCV types with varying power ratings, battery capacities, fuel range, and cost structures, minimizing total daily cost from labor, fuel, amortized capital expenditure, and energy purchase under temporal service windows, resource budgets, and energy-delivery constraints. The formulation is implemented in Python/Gurobi and applied to two case studies using California Department of Transportation wheel-loader data in Los Angeles (dense urban) and Truckee (sparse mountainous). Results show that simultaneous optimization yields compact, well-utilized fleets that meet all service windows while revealing strong sensitivity of unit cost to demand density and geography.

Despite the intuitive appeal of this method, we find that it fails to significantly improve performance even on simple synthetic tasks across multiple models.

To address these limitations, we propose a prompt-free collaborative agent framework that automatically enhances the quality of paper-to-code generation. Our approach employs two collaborative agents: a verification agent that examines whether the outputs at each step satisfy the requirements specified in the corresponding system prompt, and a refinement agent that revises the outputs based on the identified issues.

We integrate our collaborative agents into the Paper2Code framework and conduct comprehensive experiments on PaperBench Code-Dev and Paper2CodeBench datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the accuracy and completeness of reproduced code, achieving performance gains of approximately 15\\% and 13\\%, respectively, compared to the baseline without our agents.

We explicitly construct a three-dimensional region for the PID gains that is sufficient to guarantee global stability and asymptotic tracking of constant references for all nonlinearities satisfying these Jacobian bounds. We then derive a corresponding necessary region, thereby revealing the inherent conservatism required to cope with worst-case uncertainties. Moreover, under additional structural assumptions on the nonlinearities, these sufficient and necessary regions coincide, yielding a precise necessary-and-sufficient characterization of all globally stabilizing PID gains.

However, emerging evidence suggests that iterative reasoning may foster belief entrenchment and confirmation bias, rather than enhancing truth-seeking behavior. In this study, we propose a systematic evaluation framework for belief entrenchment in LLM reasoning by leveraging the Martingale property from Bayesian statistics. This property implies that, under rational belief updating, the expected value of future beliefs should remain equal to the current belief, i.e., belief updates are unpredictable from the current belief. We propose the unsupervised, regression-based Martingale Score to measure violations of this property, which signal deviation from the Bayesian ability of updating on new evidence. In open-ended problem domains including event forecasting, value-laden questions, and academic paper review, we find such violations to be widespread across models and setups, where the current belief positively predicts future belief updates, a phenomenon which we term belief entrenchment. We identify the models, reasoning techniques, and domains more prone to belief entrenchment. Finally, we validate the Martingale Score by showing that it predicts ground-truth accuracy on problem domains where ground truth labels are available. This indicates that, while designed as an unsupervised metric that operates even in domains without access to ground truth, the Martingale Score is a useful proxy of the truth-seeking ability of a reasoning process."}

Despite the success achieved, current learning-based solutions regard community search, i.e., locating the best community for a given query, and community detection, i.e., partitioning the whole graph, as separate problems, necessitating task- and dataset-specific retraining. Such a strategy limits the applicability and generalization ability of the existing models. Additionally, these methods rely heavily on information from the target dataset, leading to suboptimal performance when supervision is limited or unavailable. To mitigate this limitation, we propose UniCom, a unified framework to solve both community search and detection tasks through knowledge transfer across multiple domains, thus alleviating the limitations of single-dataset learning. UniCom centers on a Domain-aware Specialization (DAS) procedure that adapts on the fly to unseen graphs or tasks, eliminating costly retraining while maintaining framework compactness with a lightweight prompt-based paradigm. This is empowered by a Universal Graph Learning (UGL) backbone, which distills transferable semantic and topological knowledge from multiple source domains via comprehensive pre-training. Both DAS and UGL are informed by local neighborhood signals and cohesive subgraph structures, providing consistent guidance throughout the framework. Extensive experiments on both tasks across 16 benchmark datasets and 22 baselines have been conducted to ensure a comprehensive and fair evaluation. UniCom consistently outperforms all state-of-the-art baselines across all tasks under settings with scarce or no supervision, while maintaining runtime efficiency."}

Yet in practice, unguided self-evolving systems often plateau quickly or even degrade as training progresses. These failures arise from issues such as concept drift, diversity collapse, and mis-evolution, as models reinforce their own biases and converge toward low-entropy behaviors. To enable models to self-evolve in a stable and controllable manner while minimizing reliance on human supervision, we introduce R-Few, a guided Self-Play Challenger-Solver framework that incorporates lightweight human oversight through in-context grounding and mixed training. At each iteration, the Challenger samples a small set of human-labeled examples to guide synthetic question generation, while the Solver jointly trains on human and synthetic examples under an online, difficulty-based curriculum. Across math and general reasoning benchmarks, R-Few achieves consistent and iterative improvements. For example, Qwen3-8B-Base improves by +3.0 points over R-Zero on math tasks and achieves performance on par with General-Reasoner, despite the latter being trained on 20 times more human data. Ablation studies confirm the complementary contributions of grounded challenger training and curriculum-based solver training, and further analysis shows that R-Few mitigates drift, yielding more stable and controllable co-evolutionary dynamics."}

As LLMs increasingly mediate online communication, their potential to foster empathy and constructive dialogue becomes an important frontier for responsible AI research. This work explores whether LLMs can serve not only as moderators that detect harmful content, but as mediators capable of understanding and de-escalating online conflicts. Our framework decomposes mediation into two subtasks: judgment, where an LLM evaluates the fairness and emotional dynamics of a conversation, and steering, where it generates empathetic, de-escalatory messages to guide participants toward resolution. To assess mediation quality, we construct a large Reddit-based dataset and propose a multi-stage evaluation pipeline combining principle-based scoring, user simulation, and human comparison. Experiments show that API-based models outperform open-source counterparts in both reasoning and intervention alignment when doing mediation. Our findings highlight both the promise and limitations of current LLMs as emerging agents for online social mediation."}

This study proposes two preferential models to explore how news spreads on social media. Specifically, we examine global and local preferential selection models and demonstrate that information dissemination aligns with these patterns. According to these two models, information flows are distributed through specific paths on networks. This suggests that new information tends to propagate along the same paths as previous news, with the specific pathways varying depending on the type of content. Finally, an examination of the propagation of political hashtags on Twitter confirms the existence of these paths that also emerge from the two preferential models."}

AI systems increase the speed and clarity of managerial decisions, yet implementation faces challenges. The most frequent barriers include employee resistance, high costs, and regulatory ambiguity.

This study included 464 AIS patients with discharge summaries and 90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores.

We compared COPE with GPT-4.1, ClinicalBERT, a structured variable-based machine learning model (Clinical ML), and a single-step LLM without CoT. Performance was evaluated using mean absolute error (MAE), accuracy within +/-1 mRS point, and exact accuracy. COPE achieved an MAE of 1.01 (95% CI 0.92-1.11), +/-1 accuracy of 74.4% (69.9, 78.8%), and exact accuracy of 32.8% (28.0, 37.6%), comparable to GPT-4.1 and superior to ClinicalBERT [MAE 1.24 (1.13-1.36)], Clinical ML [1.28 (1.18-1.39)], and the single-step LLM [1.20 (1.09-1.33)]. Subgroup analyses showed consistent performance across sex and age, with slightly higher error among older patients, those undergoing thrombectomy, and those with longer summaries.

By emulating human-like perception and decision-making processes, these models can predict and adapt to dynamic environments. Existing methods typically map high-dimensional observations into compact latent spaces and learn optimal policies within these latent representations. However, prior work usually jointly learns ego-vehicle dynamics and environmental transition dynamics from the image input, leading to inefficiencies and a lack of robustness to variations in vehicle dynamics. To address these issues, we propose the Vehicle Dynamics embedded Dreamer (VDD) method, which decouples the modeling of ego-vehicle dynamics from environmental transition dynamics. This separation allows the world model to generalize effectively across vehicles with diverse parameters. Additionally, we introduce two strategies to further enhance the robustness of the learned policy: Policy Adjustment during Deployment (PAD) and Policy Augmentation during Training (PAT).

This research introduces the LangGraph-based Task Allocation Agent (LTAA), an LLM-driven framework that integrates phase-adaptive allocation strategies, multi-stage validation with hierarchical retries, and dynamic prompting for efficient robot coordination. Although recent LLM approaches show potential for construction robotics, they largely lack rigorous validation and benchmarking against established algorithms. This paper presents the first systematic comparison of LLM-based task allocation with traditional methods in construction scenarios.The study validates LLM feasibility through SMART-LLM replication and addresses implementation challenges using a Self-Corrective Agent Architecture. LTAA leverages natural-language reasoning combined with structured validation mechanisms, achieving major computational gains reducing token usage by 94.6% and allocation time by 86% through dynamic prompting. The framework adjusts its strategy across phases: emphasizing execution feasibility early and workload balance in later allocations.The authors evaluate LTAA against Dynamic Programming, Q-learning, and Deep Q-Network (DQN) baselines using construction operations from the TEACh human-robot collaboration dataset. In the Heavy Excels setting, where robots have strong task specializations, LTAA achieves 77% task completion with superior workload balance, outperforming all traditional methods. These findings show that LLM-based reasoning with structured validation can match established optimization algorithms while offering additional advantages such as interpretability, adaptability, and the ability to update task logic without retraining."}

These scenarios are commonly formulated as multi-agent informative path planning (MAIPP), where multiple agents must coordinate to maximize information gain while operating under budget constraints. A central challenge in MAIPP is ensuring effective coordination while the belief over the environment evolves with incoming measurements. Recent learning-based approaches address this by using distributions over future positions as \"intent\" to support coordination. However, these autoregressive intent predictors are computationally expensive and prone to compounding errors. Inspired by the effectiveness of diffusion models as expressive, long-horizon policies, we propose AID, a fully decentralized MAIPP framework that leverages diffusion models to generate long-term trajectories in a non-autoregressive manner. AID first performs behavior cloning on trajectories produced by existing MAIPP planners and then fine-tunes the policy using reinforcement learning via Diffusion Policy Policy Optimization (DPPO). This two-stage pipeline enables the policy to inherit expert behavior while learning improved coordination through online reward feedback. Experiments demonstrate that AID consistently improves upon the MAIPP planners it is trained from, achieving up to 4x faster execution and 17% increased information gain, while scaling effectively to larger numbers of agents.

Yang Zhang leads the whole project", "summary": "Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, trained via flow-matching or diffusion objectives, excel at learning complex behaviors from large-scale, multi-modal datasets (e.g., human teleoperation, scripted policies). However, since VLAs incorporate diverse data modes in the pre-training stage, and the finetuning dataset often contains demonstration data collected in a kinematically suboptimal or undesirable way, it exists redundant action modes that are irrelevant to the success action modes of the downstream task. Specifically, we observe a critical inference-time fragility among various sampled noises after supervised finetuning of pre-trained VLAs. In this paper, we attribute this instability to the distribution shift between the VLA policy and the policy induced by stable success modes of the downstream task dataset. Thus, we propose \\textbf{TACO}, a test-time-scaling (TTS) framework that applies a lightweight pseudo-count estimator as a high-fidelity verifier of action chunks. The VLA models integrated with TACO can execute the actions with maximum pseudo-count from all sampled action chunks, thereby preventing distribution shifts while preserving the generalization ability of VLAs since the constraint is applied only during inference. Our method resembles the classical anti-exploration principle in offline reinforcement learning (RL), and being gradient-free, it incurs significant computational benefits compared to RL update, especially for flow or diffusion-based VLAs which are difficult to perform RL update due to denoising process. Extensive experiments across four simulation benchmarks (RoboTwin2.0, Robotwin, LIBERO, SimplerEnv) and a dual-arm platform demonstrate that our method significantly improves the inference stability and success rates in downstream-task adaptations."}

Current ethical frameworks in this domain often implicitly rely on contested functionalist assumptions, prioritize speculative AI welfare over concrete human interests, and lack coherent theoretical foundations. We address these limitations through a structured three-level framework grounded in philosophical uncertainty. At the foundational level, we establish five factual determinations about AI consciousness alongside human-centralism as our meta-ethical stance. These foundations logically entail three operational principles: presumption of no consciousness (placing the burden of proof on consciousness claims), risk prudence (prioritizing human welfare under uncertainty), and transparent reasoning (enabling systematic evaluation and adaptation). At the application level, the third component of our framework, we derive default positions on pressing ethical questions through a transparent logical process where each position can be explicitly traced back to our foundational commitments. Our approach balances philosophical rigor with practical guidance, distinguishes consciousness from anthropomorphism, and creates pathways for responsible evolution as scientific understanding advances, providing a human-centric foundation for navigating these profound ethical challenges."}

To address this gap, we introduce the robotic capabilities framework, a vocabulary that enables transdisciplinary collaborations to meaningfully shape the future of work when robotic systems are integrated into the workplace. Rather than focusing on the internal workings of robots, the framework centers discussion on high-level capabilities, supporting dialogue around which elements of a task should remain human-led and which can be delegated to robots. We developed the framework through reflexive and iterative processes, and applied it in two distinct settings: by engaging roboticists in describing existing commercial robots using its vocabulary, and through a design activity with students working on robotics-related projects. The framework emerges as an intermediate-level knowledge artifact and a boundary object that bridges technical and experiential domains, guiding designers, empowering workers, and contributing to more just and collaborative futures of work."}

The method comprises the Multi-Modal Empathy Prediction and Supervisory Documentation Assisted Training. We use pre-trained networks in the empathy prediction network to extract features from various modalities, followed by a cross-modal fusion. This process yields a multi-modal feature representation, which is employed to predict empathy labels. To enhance the extraction of text features, we incorporate supervisory documents as privileged information during the assisted training phase. Specifically, we apply the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model to identify potential topic distributions to constrain text features. These supervisory documents, created by supervisors, focus on the counseling topics and the counselor's display of empathy.

A mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) approach is used to optimize agent coordination within a circular control zone centered at the intersection. We introduce the concept of fairness, measured via pairwise reversal counts, and incorporate fairness constraints into the MILP framework. We then study the relationship between fairness and system efficiency and its impact on platoon formation. Finally, simulation studies analyze the effectiveness of early versus late intervention strategies and fairness-aware control, focusing on safe, efficient, and robust management of agents within the control zone."}

Given a high-level objective, the system autonomously grows a dynamic, recursive agent topology incrementally tailored to the problem's structure. This allows it to scale its organizational complexity to match open-ended tasks. To mitigate the error propagation inherent in unidirectional function calls, IACT introduces interactional redundancy by replacing rigid invocations with bidirectional, stateful dialogues.

Standard imitation learning policies fail by averaging these distinct actions into a single, invalid action. In this paper, we introduce SAM2Grasp, a novel framework that resolves this issue by reformulating the task as a uni-modal, prompt-conditioned prediction problem. Our method leverages the frozen SAM2 model to use its powerful visual temporal tracking capability and introduces a lightweight, trainable action head that operates in parallel with its native segmentation head. This design allows for training only the small action head on pre-computed temporal-visual features from SAM2. During inference, an initial prompt, such as a bounding box provided by an upstream object detection model, designates the specific object to be grasped. This prompt conditions the action head to predict a unique, unambiguous grasp trajectory for that object alone. In all subsequent video frames, SAM2's built-in temporal tracking capability automatically maintains stable tracking of the selected object, enabling our model to continuously predict the grasp trajectory from the video stream without further external guidance. This temporal-prompted approach effectively eliminates ambiguity from the visuomotor policy. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that SAM2Grasp achieves state-of-the-art performance in cluttered, multi-object grasping tasks."}

To mitigate this domain discrepancy issue, prior adversarial domain adaptation methods focused on deriving domain-invariant features. Nevertheless, they overlook target-specific information and inconsistency characteristics pertinent to the degradation stages, resulting in suboptimal performance. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel domain adaptation approach for cross-domain RUL prediction named TACDA.

However, existing approaches fall short in environments where multiple high-level events (i.e., atomic propositions) can be true at the same time and potentially interact in complicated ways. In this work, we propose a novel approach to learning a multi-task policy for following arbitrary LTL instructions that addresses this shortcoming. Our method conditions the policy on sequences of simple Boolean formulae, which directly align with transitions in the automaton, and are encoded via a graph neural network (GNN) to yield structured task representations. Experiments in a complex chess-based environment demonstrate the advantages of our approach."}

The results indicate that even in the simplest cases, the prevailing industry paradigm of emulating legacy GC-SG behaviour in GFM converters (high inertia to slow down the system and large droop to increase damping) could be a suboptimal policy. It is shown that GC-SGs exhibit a fundamental trade-off: adequate damping of the turbine-governor mode requires large droop constants, inevitably increasing steady-state frequency deviation and dependence on secondary regulation. In contrast, droop-based GFM converters invert this relationship: decreasing the droop constant simultaneously reduces steady-state frequency deviations and increases damping, while allowing virtual inertia to be freely chosen. When two GC-SGs are coupled, the poorly damped electromechanical swing mode emerges. Results show that replacing one GC-SG with a GFM converter of equivalent droop and inertia already significantly improves damping of both swing and turbine-governor modes. Counter-intuitively, further and remarkable damping gains are achieved by substantially lowering the GFM virtual inertia constant. These findings suggest that current industry trends may be constraining the potential benefits of Inverter Based Resources (IBRs). Optimal stability and performance are instead obtained with low droop and low virtual inertia, yielding tightly bounded frequency variations and strongly-damped electromechanical modes. The results indicate a need to re-evaluate GFM control design principles and emerging grid-code requirements."}

While prior research has extensively studied length generalization (a model's ability to handle longer sequences than seen during training), we investigate a distinct and underexplored limitation: depth generalization. Here, depth refers to the number of nested levels in a hierarchical problem, such as the layers of parentheses in a mathematical expression or the nesting of logical clauses in a Boolean formula. Our work reveals that standard transformer architectures struggle with problems involving deeper recursion than encountered during training, even when they perform well on longer but non-nested sequences. This limitation stems from their inability to maintain stack-like behavior, the capacity to track and resolve multiple levels of nested dependencies. Through systematic analysis, we demonstrate how this architectural constraint leads to rapid performance decay as the depth of the recursion increases. To address this challenge, we develop a novel looped locate-and-replace pipeline that decomposes recursive problems into manageable subcomponents. The approach employs two specialized models: a locator that identifies solvable subexpressions and a replacer that evaluates these components while preserving the overall structure. We evaluated this method in three carefully designed domains: Boolean algebra, recursive arithmetic, and propositional logic, each with a controllable depth of recursion. We show that our method effectively alleviates the performance decay when tested on out-of-distribution recursion depth."}

The FRTD assigns a probability mass function to each node, allowing us to define a distance between any pair of nodes using standard metrics for discrete distributions. We present several arguments to motivate the FRTD embedding. First, we show that FRTDs are strictly more informative than eigenvalue spectra, yet insufficient for complete graph identification, thus placing FRTD equivalence between cospectrality and isomorphism. Second, we argue that FRTD equivalence between nodes captures structural similarity. Third, we empirically demonstrate that the FRTD embedding outperforms manually designed graph metrics in network alignment tasks. Finally, we show that random networks that approximately match the FRTD of a desired target also preserve other salient features. Together these results demonstrate the FRTD as a simple and mathematically principled embedding for complex networks."}

Although existing methods have advanced emotion understanding, they often suffer from reasoning drift: models gradually rely on their own generated text instead of multimodal evidence, and their explanations are overly shaped by visually initiated reasoning paths. To address these issues, we introduce Modality Importance (MI), a simple yet effective mechanism for identifying the emotion-dominant modality. Using MI, MIGR reorganizes reasoning sequences so that explanations begin from the modality most critical to the target emotion, preventing early reasoning from being misled by less informative cues. Our two-stage framework-comprising modality-aligned supervised fine-tuning and modality-aware reward optimization-encourages models to generate emotionally grounded, causally relevant, and coherence-preserving explanations. Experimental results on the DFEW benchmark show that MIGR substantially improves reasoning reliability, decreasing instances of correct predictions accompanied by emotionally inconsistent explanations from 18.10% to 7.37%. These results confirm the benefit of initiating reasoning from the emotion-dominant modality."}

We validate our method through experiments on locally trained models via unlearning, and on large-scale models through a style-specific experiment.

In this study, we introduce Menta, the first optimized SLM fine-tuned specifically for multi-task mental health prediction from social media data. Menta is jointly trained across six classification tasks using a LoRA-based framework, a cross-dataset strategy, and a balanced accuracy--oriented loss.

While large language models (LLMs) offer new avenues for text-based forecasting, their application in finance is hindered by noisy news data and the lack of explicit answers in text. General-purpose memory architectures struggle to identify the key drivers of price movements. To address this, we propose StockMem, an event-reflection dual-layer memory framework. It structures news into events and mines them along two dimensions: horizontal consolidation integrates daily events, while longitudinal tracking captures event evolution to extract incremental information reflecting market expectation discrepancies. This builds a temporal event knowledge base. By analyzing event-price dynamics, the framework further forms a reflection knowledge base of causal experiences. For prediction, it retrieves analogous historical scenarios and reasons with current events, incremental data, and past experiences. Experiments show StockMem outperforms existing memory architectures and provides superior, explainable reasoning by tracing the information chain affecting prices, enhancing decision transparency in financial forecasting."}

From monocular RGB or RGB-D inputs, we perform high precision HOI reconstruction and enforce physical plausibility via a reinforcement learning (RL) optimizer that refines hand object relative poses under contact and penetration constraints. The reconstructed, contact rich trajectories are then retargeted to cross-embodiments, robot arms with simple end effectors, dexterous hands, and humanoids, yielding executable actions and rollouts. To scale coverage, we build a simulation-augmented framework on Isaac Sim with diverse domain randomization (embodiments, trajectories, object retrieval, background textures, hand motion mirroring), which enriches the distributions of trajectories and observations while preserving spatial relationships and physical plausibility. The entire data pipeline forms an end to end pipeline from video,reconstruction,retargeting,augmentation data acquisition. We validate the data on mainstream vision language action (VLA) and imitation learning architectures, demonstrating that trajectories produced by our pipeline are as stable as those from teleoperation and yield comparable continual performance gains. To our knowledge, this provides the first quantitative evidence that HOI modalities can serve as effective supervision for robotic learning. Compared with teleoperation, Robowheel is lightweight, a single monocular RGB(D) camera is sufficient to extract a universal, embodiment agnostic motion representation that could be flexibly retargeted across embodiments. We further assemble a large scale multimodal dataset combining multi-camera captures, monocular videos, and public HOI corpora for training and evaluating embodied models."}

We prove that this operator generates a vector field on the parameter manifold $Θ$, and we identify the coefficient of self-improvement $κ$ as the Lie derivative of the capability functional along this flow.\n  The central contribution of this work is the derivation of the Variance Inequality, a spectral condition that is sufficient (under mild regularity) for the stability of self-improvement. We show that a sufficient condition for $κ> 0$ is that, up to curvature and step-size effects, the combined noise of generation and verification must be small enough.\n  We then apply this formalism to unify the recent literature on Language Self-Play (LSP), Self-Correction, and Synthetic Data bootstrapping. We demonstrate that architectures such as STaR, SPIN, Reflexion, GANs and AlphaZero are specific topological realizations of the GVU operator that satisfy the Variance Inequality through filtration, adversarial discrimination, or grounding in formal systems."}

To address these limitations, we propose a prompt-free collaborative agent framework that automatically enhances the quality of paper-to-code generation. Our approach employs two collaborative agents: a verification agent that examines whether the outputs at each step satisfy the requirements specified in the corresponding system prompt, and a refinement agent that revises the outputs based on the identified issues. Unlike previous methods that require human experts to craft specific refinement prompts for each step, our framework achieves automatic verification and improvement by leveraging only the original system prompts. We integrate our collaborative agents into the Paper2Code framework and conduct comprehensive experiments on PaperBench Code-Dev and Paper2CodeBench datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the accuracy and completeness of reproduced code, achieving performance gains of approximately 15\\% and 13\\%, respectively, compared to the baseline without our agents.

Recent work on Bayesian inference found that tempering the likelihood or full posterior of an imperfect model can improve predictive accuracy, as measured by expected negative log likelihood. In this paper, we develop the tempered Bayes filter, improving estimation performance through both of the aforementioned, and one newly introduced, modalities. The result admits a recursive implementation with a computational complexity no higher than that of the original Bayes filter. Our analysis reveals that -- besides the well-known fact in the field of Bayesian inference that likelihood tempering affects the balance between prior and likelihood -- full-posterior tempering tunes the level of entropy in the final belief distribution. We further find that a region of the tempering space can be understood as interpolating between the Bayes- and MAP filters, recovering these as special cases. Analytical results further establish conditions under which a tempered Bayes filter achieves improved predictive performance. Specializing the results to the linear Gaussian case, we obtain the tempered Kalman filter. In this context, we interpret how the parameters affect the Kalman state estimate and covariance propagation.

Yang Zhang leads the whole project", "summary": "Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, trained via flow-matching or diffusion objectives, excel at learning complex behaviors from large-scale, multi-modal datasets (e.g., human teleoperation, scripted policies). However, since VLAs incorporate diverse data modes in the pre-training stage, and the finetuning dataset often contains demonstration data collected in a kinematically suboptimal or undesirable way, it exists redundant action modes that are irrelevant to the success action modes of the downstream task. Specifically, we observe a critical inference-time fragility among various sampled noises after supervised finetuning of pre-trained VLAs. In this paper, we attribute this instability to the distribution shift between the VLA policy and the policy induced by stable success modes of the downstream task dataset. Thus, we propose \\textbf{TACO}, a test-time-scaling (TTS) framework that applies a lightweight pseudo-count estimator as a high-fidelity verifier of action chunks. The VLA models integrated with TACO can execute the actions with maximum pseudo-count from all sampled action chunks, thereby preventing distribution shifts while preserving the generalization ability of VLAs since the constraint is applied only during inference. Our method resembles the classical anti-exploration principle in offline reinforcement learning (RL), and being gradient-free, it incurs significant computational benefits compared to RL update, especially for flow or diffusion-based VLAs which are difficult to perform RL update due to denoising process. Extensive experiments across four simulation benchmarks (RoboTwin2.0, Robotwin, LIBERO, SimplerEnv) and a dual-arm platform demonstrate that our method significantly improves the inference stability and success rates in downstream-task adaptations."}

However, safety-critical scenarios that can effectively expose system vulnerabilities are extremely sparse in the real world. Existing scenario generation methods face challenges in efficiently constructing long-tail scenarios that ensure fidelity, criticality, and interactivity, while particularly lacking real-time dynamic response capabilities to the vehicle under test (VUT). To address these challenges, this paper proposes a safety-critical testing scenario generation framework that integrates the high-level semantic understanding capabilities of Vision Language Models (VLMs) with the fine-grained generation capabilities of adaptive guided diffusion models. The framework establishes a three-layer hierarchical architecture comprising a strategic layer for VLM-directed scenario generation objective determination, a tactical layer for guidance function formulation, and an operational layer for guided diffusion execution. We first establish a high-quality fundamental diffusion model that learns the data distribution of real driving scenarios. Next, we design an adaptive guided diffusion method that enables real-time, precise control of background vehicles (BVs) in closed-loop simulation. The VLM is then incorporated to autonomously generate scenario generation objectives and guidance functions through deep scenario understanding and risk reasoning, ultimately guiding the diffusion model to achieve VLM-directed scenario generation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can efficiently generate realistic, diverse, and highly interactive safety-critical testing scenarios. Furthermore, case studies validate the adaptability and VLM-directed generation performance of the proposed method."}

To remove the need for annotated or planner-produced paths, we introduce a planner-free trajectory construction pipeline based on randomized waypoint sampling, Bezier smoothing, and regularization enforcing connectivity, safety, directionality, and path thinness. This enables learning stable motion priors without demonstrations. SwarmDiffusion leverages VLM-derived supervision without prompt engineering and conditions the diffusion process on a compact embodiment state, producing physically consistent, traversable paths that transfer across different robot platforms.

Since the expectation over all disturbances is generally intractable, a common surrogate is the empirical cost, obtained by averaging over a finite dataset of sampled noise realizations. This substitution, however, introduces the challenge of guaranteeing performance under unseen disturbances. The issue is particularly severe when the dataset is limited, as the trained controllers may overfit, leading to substantial gaps between their empirical cost and the deployment cost. In this work, we develop a PAC-Bayesian framework that establishes rigorous generalization bounds for SNOC. Building on these bounds, we propose a principled controller design method that balances empirical performance and prior knowledge. To ensure tractability, we derive computationally efficient relaxations of the bounds and employ approximate inference methods. Our framework further leverages expressive neural controller parameterizations, guaranteeing closed-loop stability. Through simulated examples, we highlight how prior knowledge can be incorporated into control design and how more reliable controllers can be synthesized for cooperative robotics."}

The last two authors shared the supervision equally", "summary": "Reachability analysis has been a prominent way to provide safety guarantees for neurally controlled autonomous systems, but its direct application to neural perception components is infeasible due to imperfect or intractable perception models. Typically, this issue has been bypassed by complementing reachability with statistical analysis of perception error, say with conformal prediction (CP). However, existing CP methods for time-series data often provide conservative bounds. The corresponding error accumulation over time has made it challenging to combine statistical bounds with symbolic reachability in a way that is provable, scalable, and minimally conservative. To reduce conservatism and improve scalability, our key insight is that perception error varies significantly with the system's dynamical state. This article proposes state-dependent conformal prediction, which exploits that dependency in constructing tight high-confidence bounds on perception error. Based on this idea, we provide an approach to partition the state space, using a genetic algorithm, so as to optimize the tightness of conformal bounds. Finally, since using these bounds in reachability analysis leads to additional uncertainty and branching in the resulting hybrid system, we propose a branch-merging reachability algorithm that trades off uncertainty for scalability so as to enable scalable and tight verification. The evaluation of our verification methodology on two complementary case studies demonstrates reduced conservatism compared to the state of the art."}

However, emerging evidence suggests that iterative reasoning may foster belief entrenchment and confirmation bias, rather than enhancing truth-seeking behavior. In this study, we propose a systematic evaluation framework for belief entrenchment in LLM reasoning by leveraging the Martingale property from Bayesian statistics. This property implies that, under rational belief updating, the expected value of future beliefs should remain equal to the current belief, i.e., belief updates are unpredictable from the current belief. We propose the unsupervised, regression-based Martingale Score to measure violations of this property, which signal deviation from the Bayesian ability of updating on new evidence. In open-ended problem domains including event forecasting, value-laden questions, and academic paper review, we find such violations to be widespread across models and setups, where the current belief positively predicts future belief updates, a phenomenon which we term belief entrenchment. We identify the models, reasoning techniques, and domains more prone to belief entrenchment. Finally, we validate the Martingale Score by showing that it predicts ground-truth accuracy on problem domains where ground truth labels are available. This indicates that, while designed as an unsupervised metric that operates even in domains without access to ground truth, the Martingale Score is a useful proxy of the truth-seeking ability of a reasoning process."}

The method fuses GNSS and IMU data using an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) on a manifold, enabling continuous attitude tracking. The proposed approach utilizes attitude information from satellite combinations to identify and exclude multipath-affected satellites, improving the accuracy of both positioning and attitude determination. To address computational challenges associated with evaluating large numbers of satellite combinations, we propose the use of the Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) algorithm, which reduces the number of combinations assessed while maintaining high detection performance. Performance evaluations are conducted using trajectories and IMU readings from the KITTI dataset. GNSS observations are simulated based on ground truth positions and satellite ephemeris. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in detecting satellites affected by multipath interference. Significant improvements in positioning accuracy are observed, particularly in scenarios where a large portion of the visible satellites are contaminated by severe multipath."}

Our framework decomposes mediation into two subtasks: judgment, where an LLM evaluates the fairness and emotional dynamics of a conversation, and steering, where it generates empathetic, de-escalatory messages to guide participants toward resolution. To assess mediation quality, we construct a large Reddit-based dataset and propose a multi-stage evaluation pipeline combining principle-based scoring, user simulation, and human comparison. Experiments show that API-based models outperform open-source counterparts in both reasoning and intervention alignment when doing mediation.

Motivated by this observation and the objective to exploit these models for model-based nonlinear control, a learning algorithm relying on an original loss function is proposed to improve the physical consistency of Lagrangian systems. A comparative analysis of different learning-based modeling approaches with the proposed solution shows significant improvements in terms of physical consistency of the learned models, on both simulated and experimental systems.

Recent methods employ video diffusion models (VDMs) to enhance robotic policies, improving their understanding and modeling of the physical world. However, existing approaches overlook the coherent and physically consistent motion representations inherently encoded across frames in VDMs. To this end, we propose Video2Act, a framework that efficiently guides robotic action learning by explicitly integrating spatial and motion-aware representations. Building on the inherent representations of VDMs, we extract foreground boundaries and inter-frame motion variations while filtering out background noise and task-irrelevant biases. These refined representations are then used as additional conditioning inputs to a diffusion transformer (DiT) action head, enabling it to reason about what to manipulate and how to move. To mitigate inference inefficiency, we propose an asynchronous dual-system design, where the VDM functions as the slow System 2 and the DiT head as the fast System 1, working collaboratively to generate adaptive actions. By providing motion-aware conditions to System 1, Video2Act maintains stable manipulation even with low-frequency updates from the VDM. For evaluation, Video2Act surpasses previous state-of-the-art VLA methods by 7.7% in simulation and 21.7% in real-world tasks in terms of average success rate, further exhibiting strong generalization capabilities."}

This approach disentangles complex variable relationships and enables counterfactual reasoning. Using post-occupancy evaluation (POE) data from the Center for the Built Environment's (CBE) Occupant Survey as a demonstration case, we show how causal discovery reveals intervention hierarchies and directional relationships that traditional associational analysis misses. The systematic distinction between causally associated and independent variables, combined with intervention prioritization capabilities, offers broad applicability to complex human-centric systems, for example, in building science or ergonomics, where understanding intervention effects is critical for optimization and decision-making."}

The analysis covers penalized regressions, dimensionality-reduction methods, ensemble learning algorithms, and neural architectures, benchmarked against a Random Walk, an AR(3), and a Dynamic Factor Model. The pipeline preserves temporal ordering through an expanding-window walk-forward design with Bayesian hyperparameter optimization, and uses moving block-bootstrap procedures both to construct prediction intervals and to obtain confidence bands for feature-importance measures. It adopts model-specific and XAI-based explainability tools. A Model Confidence Set procedure identifies statistically superior learners, which are then combined through simple, weighted, and exponentially weighted schemes; the resulting time-varying weights provide an interpretable representation of model contributions. Predictive ability is assessed via Giacomini-White tests. Empirical results show that penalized regressions, dimensionality-reduction models, and GRU networks consistently outperform all benchmarks, with RMSFE reductions of roughly 40-60%; aggregation delivers further gains.

Our algorithm is based on a four-step procedure. We first generate a matrix of probabilities of connections between all firms in the economy using an augmented gravity model embedded in a logistic function that takes firm size as mass. The model is parameterized to allow for the probability of a link between two firms to depend not only on their sizes but also on flows across the sectors to which they belong. We then use a Bernoulli draw to construct a directed but unweighted random graph from the probability distribution generated by the logistic-gravity function. We make the graph aperiodic by adding self-loops and irreducible by adding links between Strongly Connected Components while limiting distortions to sectoral flows. We convert the unweighted network to a weighted network by solving a convex quadratic programming problem that minimizes the Euclidean norm of the weights. The solution preserves the observed firm sizes and sectoral flows within reasonable bounds, while limiting the strength of the self-loops. Computationally, the algorithm is O(N2) in the worst case, but it can be evaluated in O(N) via sector-wise binning of firm sizes, albeit with an approximation error. We implement the algorithm to reconstruct the full US production network with more than 5 million firms and 100 million buyer-seller connections. The reconstructed network exhibits topological properties consistent with small samples of the real US buyer-seller networks, including fat-tails in degree distribution, mild clustering, and near-zero reciprocity.
