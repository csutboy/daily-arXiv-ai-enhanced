To\nevaluate this concept, we conducted a virtual reality study with 150 university\nparticipants role-playing as a school shooter. Within the simulation, an\nautonomous robot predicted the shooter's movements and positioned itself\nstrategically to interfere and distract. The strategy the robot used to\napproach the shooter was manipulated -- either moving directly in front of the\nshooter (aggressive) or maintaining distance (passive) -- and the distraction\nmethod, ranging from no additional cues (low), to siren and lights (medium), to\nsiren, lights, and smoke to impair visibility (high). An aggressive,\nhigh-distraction robot reduced the number of victims by 46.6% relative to a\nno-robot control. This outcome underscores both the potential of robotic\nintervention to enhance safety and the pressing ethical questions surrounding\ntheir use in school environments."}

This challenge is amplified for multi-step bimanual mobile\nmanipulation, where humans must teleoperate both a mobile base and two\nhigh-degree-of-freedom arms. Prior automated data generation frameworks have\naddressed static bimanual manipulation by augmenting a few human demonstrations\nin simulation, but they fall short for mobile settings due to two key\nchallenges: (1) determining base placement to ensure reachability, and (2)\npositioning the camera to provide sufficient visibility for visuomotor\npolicies. To address these issues, we introduce MoMaGen, which formulates data\ngeneration as a constrained optimization problem that enforces hard constraints\n(e.g., reachability) while balancing soft constraints (e.g., visibility during\nnavigation). This formulation generalizes prior approaches and provides a\nprincipled foundation for future methods. We evaluate MoMaGen on four\nmulti-step bimanual mobile manipulation tasks and show that it generates\nsignificantly more diverse datasets than existing methods. Leveraging this\ndiversity, MoMaGen can train successful imitation learning policies from a\nsingle source demonstration, and these policies can be fine-tuned with as few\nas 40 real-world demonstrations to achieve deployment on physical robotic\nhardware.

As reliance on these models increases and they become relied upon for\ncritical decision-making, trust, while essential, has become a fractured\nconcept. Here we categorize trust into three types: epistemic trust in the\ntraining data, operational trust in the model's functionality, and\ninterpersonal trust in the model developers.

Achieving high-quality reconstruction requires capturing images of\nkeypoints within the target scene from diverse viewing angles, and coverage\ncontrol offers an effective framework to meet this requirement. Meanwhile,\nrecent advances in real-time 3D reconstruction algorithms make it possible to\nrender an evolving map during flight, enabling immediate feedback to guide\ndrone motion. Building on this, we present Coverage-Recon, a novel coordinated\nimage sampling algorithm that integrates online map feedback to improve\nreconstruction quality on-the-fly. In Coverage-Recon, the coordinated motion of\ndrones is governed by a Quadratic Programming (QP)-based angle-aware coverage\ncontroller, which ensures multi-viewpoint image capture while enforcing safety\nconstraints. The captured images are processed in real time by the NeuralRecon\nalgorithm to generate an evolving 3D mesh. Mesh changes across the scene are\ninterpreted as indicators of reconstruction uncertainty and serve as feedback\nto update the importance index of the coverage control as the map evolves. The\neffectiveness of Coverage-Recon is validated through simulation and\nexperiments, demonstrating both qualitatively and quantitatively that\nincorporating online map feedback yields more complete and accurate 3D\nreconstructions than conventional methods.

However,\nthe performance of DLMs on code generation tasks, which have stronger\nstructural constraints, is significantly hampered by the critical trade-off\nbetween inference speed and output quality. We observed that accelerating the\ncode generation process by reducing the number of sampling steps usually leads\nto a catastrophic collapse in performance. In this paper, we introduce\nefficient Sampling with Adaptive acceleration and Backtracking Enhanced\nRemasking (i.e., Saber), a novel training-free sampling algorithm for DLMs to\nachieve better inference speed and output quality in code generation.\nSpecifically, Saber is motivated by two key insights in the DLM generation\nprocess: 1) it can be adaptively accelerated as more of the code context is\nestablished; 2) it requires a backtracking mechanism to reverse the generated\ntokens. Extensive experiments on multiple mainstream code generation benchmarks\nshow that Saber boosts Pass@1 accuracy by an average improvement of 1.9% over\nmainstream DLM sampling methods, meanwhile achieving an average 251.4%\ninference speedup. By leveraging the inherent advantages of DLMs, our work\nsignificantly narrows the performance gap with autoregressive models in code\ngeneration."}

However, there is a lack of\nunderstanding of the reasons commercial AI firms decide to work with the DoD or\nchoose to abstain from the defence market. This thesis argues that the contract\nlaw and procurement framework are among the most significant obstacles. This\nresearch indicates that the commercial AI industry actually views the DoD as an\nattractive customer. However, this attraction is despite the obstacles\npresented by traditional contract law and procurement practices used to solicit\nand award contracts. Drawing on social exchange theory, this thesis introduces\na theoretical framework, optimal buyer theory, to understand the factors that\ninfluence a commercial decision to engage with the DoD. Interviews from a\nsample of the participants explain why the AI industry holds such perceptions,\nopinions, and preferences about contracts generally and the DoD, specifically,\nin its role as a customer. This thesis concludes that commercial AI firms are\nattracted to contracts that are consistent with their business and technology\nconsiderations. Additionally, it develops best practices for leveraging\nexisting contract law, primarily other transaction authority, to align\ncontracting practices with commercial preferences and the machine learning\ndevelopment and deployment lifecycle."}

Existing RLVR methods,\nhowever, typically treat all tokens uniformly without accounting for\ntoken-level advantages. These methods primarily evaluate performance based on\nfinal answer correctness or Pass@K accuracy, and yet make claims about RL\npost-training leading to improved reasoning traces. This motivates our\ninvestigation into the effect of RL post-training on intermediate tokens which\nare not directly incentivized. To study this, we design an experimental setup\nusing the GRPO algorithm with Qwen-2.5-0.5B model on the GSM8K dataset. We\nintroduce trace coherence, a First-Order Logic (FOL)-based measure to capture\nthe consistency of reasoning steps by identifying errors in the traces. We\ndistinguish between trace validity and trace coherence, noting that the former\nimplies logical soundness while the latter measures local coherence via lack of\nerrors. Our results show that RL post-training overall improves trace coherence\nwith the most significant gains on problems where the base model fails but the\nRL model succeeds. Surprisingly, RL enhances local coherence without\nnecessarily producing valid or correct solutions. This highlights a crucial\ndistinction: improved local coherence in reasoning steps does not guarantee\nfinal answer correctness. We argue that claims of improved reasoning via RL\nmust be examined with care, as these may be based on improved trace coherence,\nwhich may not translate into fully valid mathematical proofs."}

In this letter, we note that conservative\nconstraints are only a problem if they prevent us from doing what we want.\nThus, instead of first choosing a CBF and then choosing a safe control with\nrespect to the CBF, we optimize over a combination of CBFs and safe controls to\nget as close as possible to our desired control, while still having the safety\nguarantee provided by the CBF.

Building on this, we present Coverage-Recon, a novel coordinated\nimage sampling algorithm that integrates online map feedback to improve\nreconstruction quality on-the-fly. In Coverage-Recon, the coordinated motion of\ndrones is governed by a Quadratic Programming (QP)-based angle-aware coverage\ncontroller, which ensures multi-viewpoint image capture while enforcing safety\nconstraints. The captured images are processed in real time by the NeuralRecon\nalgorithm to generate an evolving 3D mesh. Mesh changes across the scene are\ninterpreted as indicators of reconstruction uncertainty and serve as feedback\nto update the importance index of the coverage control as the map evolves. The\neffectiveness of Coverage-Recon is validated through simulation and\nexperiments, demonstrating both qualitatively and quantitatively that\nincorporating online map feedback yields more complete and accurate 3D\nreconstructions than conventional methods.

Planned diffusion works in two stages: first, the\nmodel creates a short autoregressive plan that breaks the output into smaller,\nindependent spans. Second, the model generates these spans simultaneously using\ndiffusion. This approach expands the speed-quality Pareto frontier and provides\na practical path to faster, high-quality text generation. On AlpacaEval, a\nsuite of 805 instruction-following prompts, planned diffusion achieves\nPareto-optimal trade-off between quality and latency, achieving 1.27x to 1.81x\nspeedup over autoregressive generation with only 0.87\\% to 5.4\\% drop in win\nrate, respectively. Our sensitivity analysis shows that the planning mechanism\nof planned diffusion is minimal and reliable, and simple runtime knobs exist to\nprovide flexible control of the quality-latency trade-off."}

Distances measured through a high quality embedding model\ncan identify semantic similarities between strings that a different metric such\nas edit distance will struggle to capture. In fact, in our investigation,\napproximate string matching would have severely undercounted (by a conservative\nestimate of $10\\times$) the amount of data that can be extracted due to trivial\nartifacts that deflate the metric. Interestingly, we find that models readily\nregurgitate training data that was used in post-training phases such as SFT or\nRL. We show that this data can be then used to train a base model, recovering a\nmeaningful amount of the original performance. We believe our work exposes a\npossibly overlooked risk towards extracting alignment data. Finally, our work\nopens up an interesting discussion on the downstream effects of distillation\npractices: since models seem to be regurgitating aspects of their training set,\ndistillation can therefore be thought of as indirectly training on the model's\noriginal dataset."}

Prior automated data generation frameworks have\naddressed static bimanual manipulation by augmenting a few human demonstrations\nin simulation, but they fall short for mobile settings due to two key\nchallenges: (1) determining base placement to ensure reachability, and (2)\npositioning the camera to provide sufficient visibility for visuomotor\npolicies. To address these issues, we introduce MoMaGen, which formulates data\ngeneration as a constrained optimization problem that enforces hard constraints\n(e.g., reachability) while balancing soft constraints (e.g., visibility during\nnavigation). This formulation generalizes prior approaches and provides a\nprincipled foundation for future methods. We evaluate MoMaGen on four\nmulti-step bimanual mobile manipulation tasks and show that it generates\nsignificantly more diverse datasets than existing methods. Leveraging this\ndiversity, MoMaGen can train successful imitation learning policies from a\nsingle source demonstration, and these policies can be fine-tuned with as few\nas 40 real-world demonstrations to achieve deployment on physical robotic\nhardware.

In this paper, we introduce and study Round-Robin\nBehavior Cloning (R2BC), a method that enables a single human operator to\neffectively train multi-robot systems through sequential, single-agent\ndemonstrations. Our approach allows the human to teleoperate one agent at a\ntime and incrementally teach multi-agent behavior to the entire system, without\nrequiring demonstrations in the joint multi-agent action space. We show that\nR2BC methods match, and in some cases surpass, the performance of an oracle\nbehavior cloning approach trained on privileged synchronized demonstrations\nacross four multi-agent simulated tasks. Finally, we deploy R2BC on two\nphysical robot tasks trained using real human demonstrations."}

Distances measured through a high quality embedding model\ncan identify semantic similarities between strings that a different metric such\nas edit distance will struggle to capture. In fact, in our investigation,\napproximate string matching would have severely undercounted (by a conservative\nestimate of $10\\times$) the amount of data that can be extracted due to trivial\nartifacts that deflate the metric.

Nevertheless, adaptive identification methods that\nintegrate quantized observations with $\\ell_1$-optimization remain largely\nunderexplored. Motivated by this gap, we develop a novel $\\ell_1$-based\nadaptive identification algorithm specifically designed for quantized\nobservations. Without relying on the traditional persistent excitation\ncondition, we establish global convergence of the parameter estimates to their\ntrue values and show that the average regret asymptotically vanishes as the\ndata size increases. Finally, we apply our new identification algorithm to a\njudicial sentencing problem using real-world data, which demonstrates its\nsuperior performance and practical significance."}

Recent advances\nin vision-language models (VLMs) for remote sensing have shown potential for\nscalable AI-driven solutions, yet challenges remain in reasoning over imagery\nand quantifying bloom severity. In this work, we introduce ALGae Observation\nand Segmentation (ALGOS), a segmentation-and-reasoning system for HAB\nmonitoring that combines remote sensing image understanding with severity\nestimation. Our approach integrates GeoSAM-assisted human evaluation for\nhigh-quality segmentation mask curation and fine-tunes vision language model on\nseverity prediction using the Cyanobacteria Aggregated Manual Labels (CAML)\nfrom NASA.

In these scenarios,\nprecision in both inter-vehicle distance and path tracking is key. With this\nmotivation, we develop a distributed model-predictive controller (MPC) for\nmulti-vehicle cargo operations that builds on the precise path-tracking of\nlidar teach and repeat. To carry cargo, a following vehicle must maintain a\nEuclidean distance offset from a lead vehicle regardless of the path curvature.\nOur approach uses a shared map to localize the robots relative to each other\nwithout GNSS or direct observations. We compare our approach to a centralized\nMPC and a baseline approach that directly measures the inter-vehicle distance.\nThe distributed MPC shows equivalent nominal performance to the more complex\ncentralized MPC. Using a direct measurement of the relative distance between\nthe leader and follower shows improved tracking performance in close-range\nscenarios but struggles with long-range offsets. The operational flexibility\nprovided by distributing the computation makes it well suited for real\ndeployments. We evaluate four types of convoyed path trackers with over 10 km\nof driving in a coupled convoy. With convoys of two and three rovers, the\nproposed distributed MPC method works in real-time to allow map-based convoying\nto maintain maximum spacing within 20 cm of the target in various conditions."}

As a result, CS1 courses will need to change\nwhat skills are taught and how they are assessed.

In this\npaper, we present the design and evaluation of a new CS1 course at a large\nresearch-intensive university that integrates the use of LLMs as a learning\ntool for students. We describe the design principles used to create our new\nCS1-LLM course, our new course objectives, and evaluation of student outcomes\nand perceptions throughout the course as measured by assessment scores and\nsurveys. Our findings suggest that 1) student exam performance outcomes,\nincluding differences among demographic groups, are largely similar to\nhistorical outcomes for courses without integration of LLM tools, 2) large,\nopen-ended projects may be particularly valuable in an LLM context, and 3)\nstudents predominantly found the LLM tools helpful, although some had concerns\nregarding over-reliance on the tools."}

A few works, recently, have demonstrated that\nenriching the self-supervision process with regular supervision (based on the\nnature of the optimal control problem), greatly accelerates convergence and\nsolution quality, however, these have been limited to single player problems\nand simple games. In this work, we introduce MADR: MPC-guided Adversarial\nDeepReach, a general framework to robustly approximate the two-player, zero-sum\ndifferential game value function. In doing so, MADR yields the corresponding\noptimal strategies for both players in zero-sum games as well as safe policies\nfor worst-case robustness.

MOVEOD combines five open data sources: American Community\nSurvey (ACS) departure time and travel time distributions, Longitudinal\nEmployer-Household Dynamics (LODES) residence-to-workplace flows, county\ngeometries, road network information from OpenStreetMap (OSM), and building\nfootprints from OSM and Microsoft, into a single OD dataset.

This ensures the OD data accurately reflects commuting patterns.

While synthetic data augmentation techniques such as SMOTE and\nADASYN have been proposed to address this issue, the optimal augmentation ratio\nremains unclear, with practitioners often defaulting to full balancing (1:1\nratio) without empirical justification.\n  This study systematically evaluates 10 data augmentation scenarios using the\nGive Me Some Credit dataset (97,243 observations, 7% default rate), comparing\nSMOTE, BorderlineSMOTE, and ADASYN at different multiplication factors (1x, 2x,\n3x). All models were trained using XGBoost and evaluated on a held-out test set\nof 29,173 real observations. Statistical significance was assessed using\nbootstrap testing with 1,000 iterations.\n  Key findings reveal that ADASYN with 1x multiplication (doubling the minority\nclass) achieved optimal performance with AUC of 0.6778 and Gini coefficient of\n0.3557, representing statistically significant improvements of +0.77% and\n+3.00% respectively (p = 0.017, bootstrap test). Higher multiplication factors\n(2x and 3x) resulted in performance degradation, with 3x showing a -0.48%\ndecrease in AUC, suggesting a \"law of diminishing returns\" for synthetic\noversampling. The optimal class imbalance ratio was found to be 6.6:1\n(majority:minority), contradicting the common practice of balancing to 1:1.\n  This work provides the first empirical evidence of an optimal \"sweet spot\"\nfor data augmentation in credit scoring, with practical guidelines for industry\npractitioners and researchers working with imbalanced datasets. While\ndemonstrated on a single representative dataset, the methodology provides a\nreproducible framework for determining optimal augmentation ratios in other\nimbalanced domains."}
