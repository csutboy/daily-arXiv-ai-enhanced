The model replicates two key\nfindings from recent literature: (1) unemployed households with previously low\nliquid assets exhibit substantially higher marginal propensities to consume\n(MPCs) out of stimulus transfers compared to high-asset households (0.50 vs\n0.34), even when neither group faces borrowing constraints, consistent with\nGanong et al. (2024); and (2) households with more past unemployment\nexperiences maintain persistently lower consumption levels after controlling\nfor current economic conditions, a \"scarring\" effect documented by Malmendier\nand Shen (2024). Unlike existing explanations based on belief updating about\nincome risk or ex-ante heterogeneity, the reinforcement learning mechanism\ngenerates both higher MPCs and lower consumption levels simultaneously through\nvalue function approximation errors that evolve with experience. Simulation\nresults closely match the empirical estimates, suggesting that adaptive\nlearning through reinforcement learning provides a unifying framework for\nunderstanding how past experiences shape current consumption behavior beyond\nwhat current economic conditions would predict."}

The spatial dispersion, terrain variability, and agricultural labor\ndependencies that characterize rural aging experiences require moving beyond\nservice-domain frameworks toward spatial stress assessment models. Current\nresearch on rural aging in China exhibits methodological gaps, systematically\nunderrepresenting the spatial stressors that older adults face daily, including\nterrain barriers, infrastructure limitations, climate exposure, and\nagricultural labor burdens. Existing rural revitalization policies emphasize\nstandardized interventions while inadequately addressing spatial heterogeneity\nand the spatially-differentiated needs of aging populations. This study\ndeveloped a GIS-based spatial stress analysis framework that applies Lawton and\nNahemow's competence-press model to quantify aging-related stressors and\nclassify rural villages by intervention needs. Using data from 27 villages in\nMamuchi Township, Shandong Province, we established four spatial stress\nindicators: slope gradient index (SGI), solar radiation exposure index (SREI),\nwalkability index (WI), and agricultural intensity index (AII). Analysis of\nvariance and hierarchical clustering revealed significant variation in spatial\npressures across villages and identified distinct typologies that require\ntargeted intervention strategies. The framework produces both quantitative\nstress measurements for individual villages and a classification system that\ngroups villages with similar stress patterns, providing planners and\npolicymakers with practical tools for designing spatially-targeted age-friendly\ninterventions in rural China and similar contexts."}

To solve this non-convex mixed-integer nonlinear\nprogramming (MINLP) problem, a penalty dual decomposition and successive convex\napproximation (PDD-SCA) algorithm is developed.

To address this, we propose modeling CoT as a certain rule-based\nstochastic process over directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), where nodes represent\nintermediate derivation states and edges encode rule applications. Within this\nframework, we introduce logical closeness, a metric that quantifies how well a\nmodel's CoT trajectory (i.e., the LLM's final output) adheres to the DAG\nstructure, providing evaluation beyond classical PASS@k metrics. Building on\nthis, we introduce the DAG-MATH CoT format and construct a benchmark that\nguides LLMs to generate CoT trajectories in this format, thereby enabling the\nevaluation of their reasoning ability under our framework. Across standard\nmathematical reasoning datasets, our analysis uncovers statistically\nsignificant differences in reasoning fidelity among representative LLM\nfamilies-even when PASS@k is comparable-highlighting gaps between final-answer\naccuracy and rule-consistent derivation.

A\nphysics-based adhesion model of a quadrupedal magnetic climbing robot is\nincorporated into simulation to capture partial contact, air-gap sensitivity,\nand probabilistic attachment failures. To stabilize learning and enable\nreliable transfer, we design a three-phase curriculum: (1) acquire a crawl gait\non flat ground without adhesion, (2) gradually rotate the gravity vector to\nvertical while activating the adhesion model, and (3) inject stochastic\nadhesion failures to encourage slip recovery. The learned policy achieves a\nhigh success rate, strong adhesion retention, and rapid recovery from\ndetachment in simulation under degraded adhesion.

We\npresent a theoretically complete and empirically efficient framework for\nmanipulation in the blind that integrates contact feedback with structural\npriors to enable robust operation in unknown environments. The framework\ncomprises three tightly coupled components: (i) a contact detection and\nlocalization module that utilizes joint torque sensing with a contact particle\nfilter to detect and localize contacts, (ii) an occupancy estimation module\nthat uses the history of contact observations to build a partial occupancy map\nof the workspace and extrapolate it into unexplored regions with learned\npredictors, and (iii) a planning module that accounts for the fact that contact\nlocalization estimates and occupancy predictions can be noisy, computing paths\nthat avoid collisions and complete tasks efficiently without eliminating\nfeasible solutions.

Our system achieves 97.1% accuracy on WebVoyager, 69.6% on\nWebArena, 60.1% on OSWorld, and 87.1% on AndroidWorld, outperforming all prior\nsystems without task-specific fine-tuning. With multiple attempts, Surfer 2\nexceeds human performance on all benchmarks. These results demonstrate that\nsystematic orchestration amplifies foundation model capabilities and enables\ngeneral-purpose computer control through visual interaction alone, while\ncalling for a next-generation vision language model to achieve Pareto-optimal\ncost-efficiency."}

Their income is largely influenced by their number of\nviews and followers, which in turn depends on the platform's recommender system\n(RS). So, as with regular jobs, it is important to ensure that RSs distribute\nrevenue in a fair way. For example, prior work analyzed whether the creators of\nthe highest-quality content would receive the most followers and income.\nResults showed this is unlikely to be the case, but did not suggest targeted\nsolutions. In this work, we first use theoretical analysis and simulations on\nsynthetic datasets to understand the system better and find interventions that\nimprove fairness for creators. We find that the use of ordered pairwise\ncomparison overcomes the cold start problem for a new set of items and greatly\nincreases the chance of achieving fair outcomes for all content creators.\nImportantly, it also maintains user satisfaction. We also test the intervention\non the MovieLens dataset and investigate its effectiveness on platforms with\ninteraction histories that are currently unfair for content creators. These\nexperiments reveal that the intervention improves fairness when deployed at\nearly stages of the platform, but the effect decreases as the strength of\npre-existing bias increases. Altogether, we find that the ordered pairwise\ncomparison approach might offer a plausible alternative for both new and\nexisting platforms to implement."}

This study explores solar-thermal DAC\nsystems that combine concentrated solar thermal technology with low-cost\nsand-based thermal energy storage to meet this demand. We analyze the\ntechno-economic performance of such systems in both grid-connected and\nstand-alone configurations. Results show that solar-thermal DAC can achieve\nannual capacity factors exceeding 80% and CO2 removal costs as low as 160-200\nUSD per ton, making it competitive with leading DAC technologies.

To solve this non-convex mixed-integer nonlinear\nprogramming (MINLP) problem, a penalty dual decomposition and successive convex\napproximation (PDD-SCA) algorithm is developed. Particularly, the original\nMINLP problem is equivalently transferred into a continuous form relying on PDD\ntheory.

Multimodal\ntext-to-image models, which are the primary subject of this article, are based\non the premise that text and image are interchangeable or exchangeable tokens\nand that there is a commensurability between them, at least as represented\nmathematically in data. The user pipeline that sees textual input become visual\noutput, however, obscures this representational regress and makes it seem like\none form transforms into the other -- as if by magic."}

We also show that our hierarchical design enables cross-embodied\nnavigation across legged and wheeled robots and is easily steerable using\nnatural language. Real-world ablations confirm that the specialist model is key\nto embodiment grounding, enabling a single high-level planner to be deployed\nacross physically distinct wheeled and legged robots. Finally, this model\nsignificantly enhances single-robot reliability, achieving 3X higher success\nrates by rejecting physically infeasible plans. Website:\nhttps://vamos-vla.github.io/"}

Using video data\nfrom Wolf et al. (2025), which compared lengthened partial (pROM) and full\nrange-of-motion (fROM) training across eight upper-body exercises in 26\nparticipants, 280 recordings were processed to extract frame-level joint-angle\ntrajectories. After filtering and smoothing, per-set metrics were derived,\nincluding range of motion (ROM), tempo, and concentric/eccentric phase\ndurations. A random-effects meta-analytic model was applied to account for\nwithin-participant and between-exercise variability. Results show that pROM\nrepetitions were performed with a smaller ROM and shorter overall durations,\nparticularly during the eccentric phase of movement. Variance analyses revealed\nthat participant-level differences, rather than exercise-specific factors, were\nthe primary driver of variation, although there is substantial evidence of\nheterogeneous treatment effects. We then introduce a novel metric, \\%ROM, which\nis the proportion of full ROM achieved during pROM, and demonstrate that this\ndefinition of lengthened partials remains relatively consistent across\nexercises. Overall, these findings suggest that lengthened partials differ from\nfull ROM training not only in ROM, but also in execution dynamics and\nconsistency, highlighting the potential of AI-based methods for advancing\nresearch and improving resistance training prescription."}

The model replicates two key\nfindings from recent literature: (1) unemployed households with previously low\nliquid assets exhibit substantially higher marginal propensities to consume\n(MPCs) out of stimulus transfers compared to high-asset households (0.50 vs\n0.34), even when neither group faces borrowing constraints, consistent with\nGanong et al. (2024); and (2) households with more past unemployment\nexperiences maintain persistently lower consumption levels after controlling\nfor current economic conditions, a \"scarring\" effect documented by Malmendier\nand Shen (2024). Unlike existing explanations based on belief updating about\nincome risk or ex-ante heterogeneity, the reinforcement learning mechanism\ngenerates both higher MPCs and lower consumption levels simultaneously through\nvalue function approximation errors that evolve with experience. Simulation\nresults closely match the empirical estimates, suggesting that adaptive\nlearning through reinforcement learning provides a unifying framework for\nunderstanding how past experiences shape current consumption behavior beyond\nwhat current economic conditions would predict."}
