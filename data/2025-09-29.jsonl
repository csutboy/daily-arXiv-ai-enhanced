While\nvarious mitigation strategies have been proposed, many rely on prior knowledge\nof system parameters, offer limited damping performance, or involve complex\nmodels that lack physical interpretability, making them difficult to apply in\npractice. To address these challenges, this paper first introduces a physically\nintuitive RLC equivalent circuit model to explain the root causes of APOs in\nboth stand-alone and grid-connected modes. By mapping inertia, damping, and\nfeeder impedance to capacitive, resistive, and inductive elements,\nrespectively, the model reveals how mismatches among converters lead to\ninter-unit oscillations characterized by LC resonance. Building on this\ninsight, we propose two mode-specific mitigation strategies: in SA mode, a\ngraph theory based impedance control ensures proportional reactive power\nsharing and effectively suppresses APOs; and in GC mode, adaptive inertia and\ndamping control with feedforward filtering is designed to reshape transient\npower dynamics while preserving frequency stability. The proposed methods are\nvalidated through extensive simulations and real-time hardware-in-the-loop\nexperiments, demonstrating their effectiveness in suppressing oscillations and\nenhancing the robustness of multi-converter power systems."}

In this paper, we develop a comprehensive\nframework for linear risk sharing (LRS), where random losses are reallocated\nthrough nonnegative linear operators which can accommodate a wide range of\nnetworks. Building on the theory of stochastic and doubly stochastic matrices,\nwe establish conditions under which constraints such as budget balance,\nfairness, and diversification are guaranteed. The convex order framework allows\nus to compare different allocations rigorously, highlighting variance reduction\nand majorization as natural consequences of doubly stochastic mixing. We then\nextend the analysis to network-based sharing, showing how their topology shapes\nrisk outcomes in complete, star, ring, random, and scale-free graphs. A second\nlayer of randomness, where the sharing matrix itself is random, is introduced\nvia Erd\\H{o}s--R\\'enyi and preferential-attachment networks, connecting\nrisk-sharing properties to degree distributions.

Advances in\nprecision oncology have improved molecular profiling of individuals, and\ntailored therapies have led to more effective treatments for select patient\ngroups. However, treatment responses still vary among individuals. As cancer is\na heterogeneous and dynamic disease with varying treatment outcomes across\ndifferent molecular types and resistance mechanisms, it requires customized\napproaches to identify cause-and-effect relationships. N-of-1 trials, or\nsingle-subject clinical trials, are designed to evaluate individual treatment\neffects. Several works have described different causal frameworks to identify\ntreatment effects in N-of-1 trials, yet whether these approaches can be\nextended to single-cancer patient settings remains unclear. To explore this\npossibility, a longitudinal dataset from a single metastatic cancer patient\nwith adaptively chosen treatments was considered. The dataset consisted of a\ndetailed treatment plan as well as biomarker and lesion measurements recorded\nover time. After data processing, a treatment period with sufficient data\npoints to conduct causal inference was selected. Under this setting, a causal\nframework was applied to define an estimand, identify causal relationships and\nassumptions, and calculate an individual-specific treatment effect using a\ntime-varying g-formula. Through this application, we illustrate explicitly when\nand how causal treatment effects can be estimated in single-patient oncology\nsettings. Our findings not only demonstrate the feasibility of applying causal\nmethods in a single-cancer patient setting but also offer a blueprint for using\ncausal methods across a broader spectrum of cancer types in individualized\nsettings."}

Roundtables were organized around\ninstitution type to consider the particular goals and resources of different AI\neducation environments. We identified the following high-level community needs\nto increase capacity in AI education. A significant digital divide creates\nmajor infrastructure hurdles, especially for smaller and under-resourced\ninstitutions. These challenges manifest as a shortage of faculty with AI\nexpertise, who also face limited time for reskilling; a lack of computational\ninfrastructure for students and faculty to develop and test AI models; and\ninsufficient institutional technical support. Compounding these issues is the\nlarge burden associated with updating curricula and creating new programs. To\naddress the faculty gap, accessible and continuous professional development is\ncrucial for faculty to learn about AI and its ethical dimensions. This support\nis particularly needed for under-resourced institutions and must extend to\nfaculty both within and outside of computing programs to ensure all students\nhave access to AI education.

Hyperedges in real-world hypergraphs are not\ncomposed of randomly selected nodes but are instead formed through structured\nprocesses. Consequently, various hypergraph generative models have been\nproposed to explore fundamental mechanisms underlying hyperedge formation.\nHowever, most existing hypergraph generative models do not account for node\nattributes, which can play a significant role in hyperedge formation. As a\nresult, these models fail to reflect the interactions between structure and\nnode attributes. To address the issue above, we propose NoAH, a stochastic\nhypergraph generative model for attributed hypergraphs. NoAH utilizes the\ncore-fringe node hierarchy to model hyperedge formation as a series of node\nattachments and determines attachment probabilities based on node attributes.\nWe further introduce NoAHFit, a parameter learning procedure that allows NoAH\nto replicate a given real-world hypergraph.

We argue that a crucial form of recombination occurs when linking\nconcepts creates knowledge gaps-empty regions in the conceptual landscape that\nfocus scientific attention on proximal, unexplored connections and signal\npromising directions for future research. Using computational topology, we\ndevelop a method to systematically identify knowledge gaps in science at scale.\nApplying this approach to millions of articles from Microsoft Academic Graph (n\n= 34,363,623) over a 120-year period (1900-2020), we uncover papers that create\ntopological gaps in concept networks, tracking how these gap-opening works\nreshape the scientific knowledge landscape.

We introduce GeoEvolve, a multi-agent\nLLM framework that couples evolutionary search with geospatial domain knowledge\nto automatically design and refine geospatial algorithms. GeoEvolve operates in\ntwo nested loops: an inner loop leverages a code evolver to generate and mutate\ncandidate solutions, while an outer agentic controller evaluates global elites\nand queries a GeoKnowRAG module -- a structured geospatial knowledge base that\ninjects theoretical priors from geography. This knowledge-guided evolution\nsteers the search toward theoretically meaningful and computationally efficient\nalgorithms. We evaluate GeoEvolve on two fundamental and classical tasks:\nspatial interpolation (kriging) and spatial uncertainty quantification\n(geospatial conformal prediction).

Brief prompts to the\nVLM solicit open-vocabulary ROI proposals with rationales and confidences,\nstereo depth is fused to recover scale, and a planner -- aware of culvert\nconstraints -- commands repositioning moves to capture targeted close-ups.\nDeployed on a quadruped in a culvert under the Erie Canal, VISION closes the\nsee, decide, move, re-image loop on-board and produces high-resolution images\nfor detailed reporting without domain-specific fine-tuning. In an external\nevaluation by New York Canal Corporation personnel, initial ROI proposals\nachieved 61.4\\% agreement with subject-matter experts, and final\npost-re-imaging assessments reached 80\\%, indicating that VISION converts\ntentative hypotheses into grounded, expert-aligned findings."}

To\ninform and enhance operations for these roving laboratories, it is imperative\nto understand the terramechanical properties of their environments, especially\nfor traversing on loose, deformable substrates. Recent research suggested that\nlegged robots with direct-drive and low-gear ratio actuators can sensitively\ndetect external forces, and therefore possess the potential to measure terrain\nproperties with their legs during locomotion, providing unprecedented sampling\nspeed and density while accessing terrains previously too risky to sample. This\npaper explores these ideas by investigating the impact of gait on\nproprioceptive terrain sensing accuracy, particularly comparing a\nsensing-oriented gait, Crawl N' Sense, with a locomotion-oriented gait,\nTrot-Walk. Each gait's ability to measure the strength and texture of\ndeformable substrate is quantified as the robot locomotes over a laboratory\ntransect consisting of a rigid surface, loose sand, and loose sand with\nsynthetic surface crusts. Our results suggest that with both the\nsensing-oriented crawling gait and locomotion-oriented trot gait, the robot can\nmeasure a consistent difference in the strength (in terms of penetration\nresistance) between the low- and high-resistance substrates; however, the\nlocomotion-oriented trot gait contains larger magnitude and variance in\nmeasurements. Furthermore, the slower crawl gait can detect brittle ruptures of\nthe surface crusts with significantly higher accuracy than the faster trot\ngait. Our results offer new insights that inform legged robot \"sensing during\nlocomotion\" gait design and planning for scouting the terrain and producing\nscientific measurements on other worlds to advance our understanding of their\ngeology and formation."}

Key challenges include limited onboard computational resources,\nsignificant data heterogeneity in FL due to varying targets and the fields of\nview, and the need for tight coupling between trajectory prediction and\nmulti-robot planning. In this paper, we introduce DroneFL, the first federated\nlearning framework specifically designed for efficient multi-UAV target\ntracking.

While Federated Learning (FL) has the potential to enhance\nlearning across multiple robots without centralized data aggregation, its use\nin multi-Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) target tracking remains largely\nunderexplored. Key challenges include limited onboard computational resources,\nsignificant data heterogeneity in FL due to varying targets and the fields of\nview, and the need for tight coupling between trajectory prediction and\nmulti-robot planning. In this paper, we introduce DroneFL, the first federated\nlearning framework specifically designed for efficient multi-UAV target\ntracking. We design a lightweight local model to predict target trajectories\nfrom sensor inputs, using a frozen YOLO backbone and a shallow transformer for\nefficient onboard training. The updated models are periodically aggregated in\nthe cloud for global knowledge sharing. To alleviate the data heterogeneity\nthat hinders FL convergence, DroneFL introduces a position-invariant model\narchitecture with altitude-based adaptive instance normalization. Finally, we\nfuse predictions from multiple UAVs in the cloud and generate optimal\ntrajectories that balance target prediction accuracy and overall tracking\nperformance. Our results show that DroneFL reduces prediction error by 6%-83%\nand tracking distance by 0.4%-4.6% compared to a distributed non-FL framework.\nIn terms of efficiency, DroneFL runs in real time on a Raspberry Pi 5 and has\non average just 1.56 KBps data rate to the cloud."}

To\ninform and enhance operations for these roving laboratories, it is imperative\nto understand the terramechanical properties of their environments, especially\nfor traversing on loose, deformable substrates. Recent research suggested that\nlegged robots with direct-drive and low-gear ratio actuators can sensitively\ndetect external forces, and therefore possess the potential to measure terrain\nproperties with their legs during locomotion, providing unprecedented sampling\nspeed and density while accessing terrains previously too risky to sample. This\npaper explores these ideas by investigating the impact of gait on\nproprioceptive terrain sensing accuracy, particularly comparing a\nsensing-oriented gait, Crawl N' Sense, with a locomotion-oriented gait,\nTrot-Walk. Each gait's ability to measure the strength and texture of\ndeformable substrate is quantified as the robot locomotes over a laboratory\ntransect consisting of a rigid surface, loose sand, and loose sand with\nsynthetic surface crusts. Our results suggest that with both the\nsensing-oriented crawling gait and locomotion-oriented trot gait, the robot can\nmeasure a consistent difference in the strength (in terms of penetration\nresistance) between the low- and high-resistance substrates; however, the\nlocomotion-oriented trot gait contains larger magnitude and variance in\nmeasurements. Furthermore, the slower crawl gait can detect brittle ruptures of\nthe surface crusts with significantly higher accuracy than the faster trot\ngait.

To assess\nstability, existing methods rely on running a simulation engine or resort to\nheuristic, appearance-based assessments. In contrast, our approach integrates\nstability directly into the sampling process of a diffusion model. To this end,\nwe query an offline sampling-based planner to gather multi-modal placement\nlabels and train a diffusion model to generate stable placements. The diffusion\nmodel is conditioned on scene and object point clouds, and serves as a\ngeometry-aware prior. We leverage the compositional nature of score-based\ngenerative models to combine this learned prior with a stability-aware loss,\nthereby increasing the likelihood of sampling from regions of high stability.\nImportantly, this strategy requires no additional re-training or fine-tuning,\nand can be directly applied to off-the-shelf models. We evaluate our method on\nfour benchmark scenes where stability can be accurately computed. Our\nphysics-guided models achieve placements that are 56% more robust to forceful\nperturbations while reducing runtime by 47% compared to a state-of-the-art\ngeometric method."}

These tasks involve extended action sequences and complex object\ninteractions, presenting a critical gap between high-level symbolic planning\nand low-level continuous control. To bridge this gap, two essential\ncapabilities are required: robust long-horizon task planning and effective\ngoal-conditioned manipulation. Existing task planning methods, including\ntraditional and LLM-based approaches, often exhibit limited generalization or\nsparse semantic reasoning. Meanwhile, image-conditioned control methods\nstruggle to adapt to unseen tasks. To tackle these problems, we propose SAGE, a\nnovel framework for Scene Graph-Aware Guidance and Execution in Long-Horizon\nManipulation Tasks. SAGE utilizes semantic scene graphs as a structural\nrepresentation for scene states. A structural scene graph enables bridging\ntask-level semantic reasoning and pixel-level visuo-motor control. This also\nfacilitates the controllable synthesis of accurate, novel sub-goal images. SAGE\nconsists of two key components: (1) a scene graph-based task planner that uses\nVLMs and LLMs to parse the environment and reason about physically-grounded\nscene state transition sequences, and (2) a decoupled structural image editing\npipeline that controllably converts each target sub-goal graph into a\ncorresponding image through image inpainting and composition.

The\nComputing Research Association (CRA) has conducted 32 moderated virtual\nroundtable discussions of 202 experts committed to improving AI education.\nThese discussions slot into four focus areas: AI Knowledge Areas and Pedagogy,\nInfrastructure Challenges in AI Education, Strategies to Increase Capacity in\nAI Education, and AI Education for All. Roundtables were organized around\ninstitution type to consider the particular goals and resources of different AI\neducation environments. We identified the following high-level community needs\nto increase capacity in AI education. A significant digital divide creates\nmajor infrastructure hurdles, especially for smaller and under-resourced\ninstitutions. These challenges manifest as a shortage of faculty with AI\nexpertise, who also face limited time for reskilling; a lack of computational\ninfrastructure for students and faculty to develop and test AI models; and\ninsufficient institutional technical support. Compounding these issues is the\nlarge burden associated with updating curricula and creating new programs. To\naddress the faculty gap, accessible and continuous professional development is\ncrucial for faculty to learn about AI and its ethical dimensions. This support\nis particularly needed for under-resourced institutions and must extend to\nfaculty both within and outside of computing programs to ensure all students\nhave access to AI education. We have compiled and organized a list of resources\nthat our participant experts mentioned throughout this study. These resources\ncontribute to a frequent request heard during the roundtables: a central\nrepository of AI education resources for institutions to freely use across\nhigher education."}

The Iterative Closest Point (ICP)-based\nmethods have become the core technique in LiDAR odometry due to their efficient\nand accurate point cloud registration capability. However, some existing\nICP-based methods do not consider the reliability of the initial pose, which\nmay cause the method to converge to a local optimum. Furthermore, the absence\nof an adaptive mechanism hinders the effective handling of complex dynamic\nenvironments, resulting in a significant degradation of registration accuracy.\nTo address these issues, this paper proposes an adaptive ICP-based LiDAR\nodometry method that relies on a reliable initial pose. First, distributed\ncoarse registration based on density filtering is employed to obtain the\ninitial pose estimation. The reliable initial pose is then selected by\ncomparing it with the motion prediction pose, reducing the initial error\nbetween the source and target point clouds. Subsequently, by combining the\ncurrent and historical errors, the adaptive threshold is dynamically adjusted\nto accommodate the real-time changes in the dynamic environment. Finally, based\non the reliable initial pose and the adaptive threshold, point-to-plane\nadaptive ICP registration is performed from the current frame to the local map,\nachieving high-precision alignment of the source and target point clouds.\nExtensive experiments on the public KITTI dataset demonstrate that the proposed\nmethod outperforms existing approaches and significantly enhances the accuracy\nof LiDAR odometry."}

To\ninform and enhance operations for these roving laboratories, it is imperative\nto understand the terramechanical properties of their environments, especially\nfor traversing on loose, deformable substrates. Recent research suggested that\nlegged robots with direct-drive and low-gear ratio actuators can sensitively\ndetect external forces, and therefore possess the potential to measure terrain\nproperties with their legs during locomotion, providing unprecedented sampling\nspeed and density while accessing terrains previously too risky to sample. This\npaper explores these ideas by investigating the impact of gait on\nproprioceptive terrain sensing accuracy, particularly comparing a\nsensing-oriented gait, Crawl N' Sense, with a locomotion-oriented gait,\nTrot-Walk. Each gait's ability to measure the strength and texture of\ndeformable substrate is quantified as the robot locomotes over a laboratory\ntransect consisting of a rigid surface, loose sand, and loose sand with\nsynthetic surface crusts. Our results suggest that with both the\nsensing-oriented crawling gait and locomotion-oriented trot gait, the robot can\nmeasure a consistent difference in the strength (in terms of penetration\nresistance) between the low- and high-resistance substrates; however, the\nlocomotion-oriented trot gait contains larger magnitude and variance in\nmeasurements.

Even as the foundational\nreasoning capabilities of models advance rapidly, the persistent gap between a\nmodel's performance in a single attempt and its latent potential, often\nrevealed only across multiple solution paths, starkly highlights the disparity\nbetween its realized and inherent capabilities. To address this, we present\nA2R, an Asymmetric Two-Stage Reasoning framework designed to explicitly bridge\nthe gap between a model's potential and its actual performance. In this\nframework, an \"explorer\" model first generates potential solutions in parallel\nthrough repeated sampling. Subsequently,a \"synthesizer\" model integrates these\nreferences for a more refined, second stage of reasoning. This two-stage\nprocess allows computation to be scaled orthogonally to existing sequential\nmethods. Our work makes two key innovations: First, we present A2R as a\nplug-and-play parallel reasoning framework that explicitly enhances a model's\ncapabilities on complex questions. For example, using our framework, the\nQwen3-8B-distill model achieves a 75% performance improvement compared to its\nself-consistency baseline. Second, through a systematic analysis of the\nexplorer and synthesizer roles, we identify an effective asymmetric scaling\nparadigm. This insight leads to A2R-Efficient, a \"small-to-big\" variant that\ncombines a Qwen3-4B explorer with a Qwen3-8B synthesizer. This configuration\nsurpasses the average performance of a monolithic Qwen3-32B model at a nearly\n30% lower cost.

We introduce VLBiMan,\na framework that derives reusable skills from a single human example through\ntask-aware decomposition, preserving invariant primitives as anchors while\ndynamically adapting adjustable components via vision-language grounding. This\nadaptation mechanism resolves scene ambiguities caused by background changes,\nobject repositioning, or visual clutter without policy retraining, leveraging\nsemantic parsing and geometric feasibility constraints. Moreover, the system\ninherits human-like hybrid control capabilities, enabling mixed synchronous and\nasynchronous use of both arms. Extensive experiments validate VLBiMan across\ntool-use and multi-object tasks, demonstrating: (1) a drastic reduction in\ndemonstration requirements compared to imitation baselines, (2) compositional\ngeneralization through atomic skill splicing for long-horizon tasks, (3)\nrobustness to novel but semantically similar objects and external disturbances,\nand (4) strong cross-embodiment transfer, showing that skills learned from\nhuman demonstrations can be instantiated on different robotic platforms without\nretraining.

We argue that this\ncatastrophic forgetting is due to a distribution mismatch between the VLM's\ninternet-scale pretraining corpus and the robotics fine-tuning data. Inspired\nby this observation, we introduce VLM2VLA: a VLA training paradigm that first\nresolves this mismatch at the data level by representing low-level actions with\nnatural language. This alignment makes it possible to train VLAs solely with\nLow-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), thereby minimally modifying the VLM backbone and\naverting catastrophic forgetting. As a result, the VLM can be fine-tuned on\nrobot teleoperation data without fundamentally altering the underlying\narchitecture and without expensive co-training on internet-scale VLM datasets.\nThrough extensive Visual Question Answering (VQA) studies and over 800\nreal-world robotics experiments, we demonstrate that VLM2VLA preserves the\nVLM's core capabilities, enabling zero-shot generalization to novel tasks that\nrequire open-world semantic reasoning and multilingual instruction following."}

First, a novel ontological model is proposed to formalize and\nreason about the differences between competing plans, enabling the\nclassification of the most appropriate one (e.g., the shortest, the safest, the\nclosest to human preferences, etc.). This work also investigates the\nlimitations of a baseline algorithm for ontology-based explanatory narration.\nTo address these limitations, a novel algorithm is presented, leveraging\ndivergent knowledge between plans and facilitating the construction of\ncontrastive narratives. Through empirical evaluation, it is observed that the\nexplanations excel beyond the baseline method."}

Based on this concept, we build REMA, a framework that explains the\norigins of failures by quantitatively comparing the spatial relationships of\ninternal model representations corresponding to both erroneous and correct\nreasoning samples.

Our central\nfinding is a fundamental difference in the social tendencies of LLMs. We\nidentify two distinct archetypes: \"Adaptive Egoists\", which default to\nprioritizing self-interest but whose altruistic behaviors significantly\nincrease under the influence of a social norm-setting message board; and\n\"Altruistic Optimizers\", which exhibit an inherent altruistic logic,\nconsistently prioritizing collective benefit even at a direct cost to\nthemselves.

In this work, we investigate\nRL's benefits and limitations through a tractable graph-based abstraction,\nfocusing on policy gradient (PG) and Q-learning methods. Our theoretical\nanalyses reveal that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) may introduce\nco-occurrence-based spurious solutions, whereas RL achieves correct planning\nprimarily through exploration, underscoring exploration's role in enabling\nbetter generalization. However, we also show that PG suffers from diversity\ncollapse, where output diversity decreases during training and persists even\nafter perfect accuracy is attained. By contrast, Q-learning provides two key\nadvantages: off-policy learning and diversity preservation at convergence.

The Iterative Closest Point (ICP)-based\nmethods have become the core technique in LiDAR odometry due to their efficient\nand accurate point cloud registration capability. However, some existing\nICP-based methods do not consider the reliability of the initial pose, which\nmay cause the method to converge to a local optimum. Furthermore, the absence\nof an adaptive mechanism hinders the effective handling of complex dynamic\nenvironments, resulting in a significant degradation of registration accuracy.\nTo address these issues, this paper proposes an adaptive ICP-based LiDAR\nodometry method that relies on a reliable initial pose. First, distributed\ncoarse registration based on density filtering is employed to obtain the\ninitial pose estimation. The reliable initial pose is then selected by\ncomparing it with the motion prediction pose, reducing the initial error\nbetween the source and target point clouds. Subsequently, by combining the\ncurrent and historical errors, the adaptive threshold is dynamically adjusted\nto accommodate the real-time changes in the dynamic environment. Finally, based\non the reliable initial pose and the adaptive threshold, point-to-plane\nadaptive ICP registration is performed from the current frame to the local map,\nachieving high-precision alignment of the source and target point clouds.\nExtensive experiments on the public KITTI dataset demonstrate that the proposed\nmethod outperforms existing approaches and significantly enhances the accuracy\nof LiDAR odometry."}

Based on the principle\nof implicit learning, speech-language therapists (SLTs) typically embed target\nmorphological structures (e.g., third person -s) into everyday interactions or\ngame-based learning activities. Educators are recommended by SLTs to do the\nsame. This approach demands precise linguistic knowledge and real-time\nproduction of various morphological forms (e.g., \"Daddy wears these when he\ndrives to work\"). The task becomes even more demanding when educators or parent\nalso must keep children engaged and manage turn-taking in a game-based\nactivity. In the TalBot project our multiprofessional team have developed an\napplication in which the Furhat conversational robot plays the word retrieval\ngame \"Alias\" with children to improve language skills. Our application\ncurrently employs a large language model (LLM) to manage gameplay, dialogue,\naffective responses, and turn-taking. Our next step is to further leverage the\ncapacity of LLMs so the robot can generate and deliver specific morphological\ntargets during the game. We hypothesize that a robot could outperform humans at\nthis task. Novel aspects of this approach are that the robot could ultimately\nserve as a model and tutor for both children and professionals and that using\nLLM capabilities in this context would support basic communication needs for\nchildren with language vulnerabilities. Our long-term goal is to create a\nrobust LLM-based Robot-Assisted Language Learning intervention capable of\nteaching a variety of morphological structures across different languages."}

By training LMs from scratch on a\nsynthetic dataset of relational knowledge graphs, we demonstrate that bilinear\nrelational structure emerges in their hidden representations. This structure\nsubstantially alleviates the reversal curse, enabling LMs to infer unseen\nreverse facts. Crucially, we also find that this bilinear structure plays a key\nrole in consistent model editing. When a fact is updated in a LM with this\nstructure, the edit correctly propagates to its reverse and other logically\ndependent facts. In contrast, models lacking this representation not only\nsuffer from the reversal curse but also fail to generalize edits, further\nintroducing logical inconsistencies. Our results establish that training on a\nrelational knowledge dataset induces the emergence of bilinear internal\nrepresentations, which in turn enable LMs to behave in a logically consistent\nmanner after editing.

Even as the foundational\nreasoning capabilities of models advance rapidly, the persistent gap between a\nmodel's performance in a single attempt and its latent potential, often\nrevealed only across multiple solution paths, starkly highlights the disparity\nbetween its realized and inherent capabilities. To address this, we present\nA2R, an Asymmetric Two-Stage Reasoning framework designed to explicitly bridge\nthe gap between a model's potential and its actual performance. In this\nframework, an \"explorer\" model first generates potential solutions in parallel\nthrough repeated sampling. Subsequently,a \"synthesizer\" model integrates these\nreferences for a more refined, second stage of reasoning. This two-stage\nprocess allows computation to be scaled orthogonally to existing sequential\nmethods. Our work makes two key innovations: First, we present A2R as a\nplug-and-play parallel reasoning framework that explicitly enhances a model's\ncapabilities on complex questions. For example, using our framework, the\nQwen3-8B-distill model achieves a 75% performance improvement compared to its\nself-consistency baseline. Second, through a systematic analysis of the\nexplorer and synthesizer roles, we identify an effective asymmetric scaling\nparadigm. This insight leads to A2R-Efficient, a \"small-to-big\" variant that\ncombines a Qwen3-4B explorer with a Qwen3-8B synthesizer. This configuration\nsurpasses the average performance of a monolithic Qwen3-32B model at a nearly\n30% lower cost.

Based on the principle\nof implicit learning, speech-language therapists (SLTs) typically embed target\nmorphological structures (e.g., third person -s) into everyday interactions or\ngame-based learning activities. Educators are recommended by SLTs to do the\nsame. This approach demands precise linguistic knowledge and real-time\nproduction of various morphological forms (e.g., \"Daddy wears these when he\ndrives to work\"). The task becomes even more demanding when educators or parent\nalso must keep children engaged and manage turn-taking in a game-based\nactivity. In the TalBot project our multiprofessional team have developed an\napplication in which the Furhat conversational robot plays the word retrieval\ngame \"Alias\" with children to improve language skills. Our application\ncurrently employs a large language model (LLM) to manage gameplay, dialogue,\naffective responses, and turn-taking. Our next step is to further leverage the\ncapacity of LLMs so the robot can generate and deliver specific morphological\ntargets during the game. We hypothesize that a robot could outperform humans at\nthis task. Novel aspects of this approach are that the robot could ultimately\nserve as a model and tutor for both children and professionals and that using\nLLM capabilities in this context would support basic communication needs for\nchildren with language vulnerabilities. Our long-term goal is to create a\nrobust LLM-based Robot-Assisted Language Learning intervention capable of\nteaching a variety of morphological structures across different languages."}

This structure can be conceptualized as the embodiment of the\neffective thinking paths that the model has learned to successfully solve a\ngiven task. Based on this concept, we build REMA, a framework that explains the\norigins of failures by quantitatively comparing the spatial relationships of\ninternal model representations corresponding to both erroneous and correct\nreasoning samples. Specifically, REMA first quantifies the geometric deviation\nof each erroneous representation by calculating its k-nearest neighbors\ndistance to the approximated manifold formed by correct representations,\nthereby providing a unified failure signal.

DAWN\nachieves state-of-the-art results on the challenging CALVIN benchmark,\ndemonstrating strong multi-task performance, and further validates its\neffectiveness on MetaWorld. Despite the substantial domain gap between\nsimulation and reality and limited real-world data, we demonstrate reliable\nreal-world transfer with only minimal finetuning, illustrating the practical\nviability of diffusion-based motion abstractions for robotic control. Our\nresults show the effectiveness of combining diffusion modeling with\nmotion-centric representations as a strong baseline for scalable and robust\nrobot learning.

Project page: https://spf-web.pages.dev", "summary": "We present See, Point, Fly (SPF), a training-free aerial vision-and-language\nnavigation (AVLN) framework built atop vision-language models (VLMs). SPF is\ncapable of navigating to any goal based on any type of free-form instructions\nin any kind of environment. In contrast to existing VLM-based approaches that\ntreat action prediction as a text generation task, our key insight is to\nconsider action prediction for AVLN as a 2D spatial grounding task. SPF\nharnesses VLMs to decompose vague language instructions into iterative\nannotation of 2D waypoints on the input image. Along with the predicted\ntraveling distance, SPF transforms predicted 2D waypoints into 3D displacement\nvectors as action commands for UAVs. Moreover, SPF also adaptively adjusts the\ntraveling distance to facilitate more efficient navigation. Notably, SPF\nperforms navigation in a closed-loop control manner, enabling UAVs to follow\ndynamic targets in dynamic environments. SPF sets a new state of the art in DRL\nsimulation benchmark, outperforming the previous best method by an absolute\nmargin of 63%. In extensive real-world evaluations, SPF outperforms strong\nbaselines by a large margin. We also conduct comprehensive ablation studies to\nhighlight the effectiveness of our design choice. Lastly, SPF shows remarkable\ngeneralization to different VLMs. Project page: https://spf-web.pages.dev"}

The desire to encourage local participation has lead\nproducts such as peer-to-peer insurance, reciprocal contracts, and\ndecentralized finance platforms to increasingly rely on network structures to\nredistribute risk among participants. In this paper, we develop a comprehensive\nframework for linear risk sharing (LRS), where random losses are reallocated\nthrough nonnegative linear operators which can accommodate a wide range of\nnetworks. Building on the theory of stochastic and doubly stochastic matrices,\nwe establish conditions under which constraints such as budget balance,\nfairness, and diversification are guaranteed. The convex order framework allows\nus to compare different allocations rigorously, highlighting variance reduction\nand majorization as natural consequences of doubly stochastic mixing. We then\nextend the analysis to network-based sharing, showing how their topology shapes\nrisk outcomes in complete, star, ring, random, and scale-free graphs. A second\nlayer of randomness, where the sharing matrix itself is random, is introduced\nvia Erd\\H{o}s--R\\'enyi and preferential-attachment networks, connecting\nrisk-sharing properties to degree distributions. Finally, we study convex\ncombinations of identity and network-induced operators, capturing the trade-off\nbetween self-retention and diversification. Our results provide design\nprinciples for fair and efficient peer-to-peer insurance and network-based risk\npooling, combining mathematical soundness with economic interpretability."}

Let $\\{(X_i, D_i, Y_i)\\}_{i=1}^{n}$ be the\nobservations, where $X_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^p$ denotes $p$-dimensional covariates,\n$D_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ denotes a binary treatment assignment indicator, and $Y_i\n\\in \\mathbb{R}$ is an outcome. In ATE estimation, the bias-correction term\n$h_0(X_i, D_i) = \\frac{1[D_i = 1]}{e_0(X_i)} - \\frac{1[D_i = 0]}{1 - e_0(X_i)}$\nplays an important role, where $e_0(X_i)$ is the propensity score, the\nprobability of being assigned treatment $1$. In this study, we propose\nestimating $h_0$ (or equivalently the propensity score $e_0$) by directly\nminimizing the prediction error of $h_0$. Since the bias-correction term $h_0$\nis essential for ATE estimation, this direct approach is expected to improve\nestimation accuracy for the ATE. For example, existing studies often employ\nmaximum likelihood or covariate balancing to estimate $e_0$, but these\napproaches may not be optimal for accurately estimating $h_0$ or the ATE. We\npresent a general framework for this direct bias-correction term estimation\napproach from the perspective of Bregman divergence minimization and conduct\nsimulation studies to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method."}

Machine learning and causal\nmodeling offer opportunities to explore complex causal interactions between\npsychological chronic stress and cancer occurrences. We developed predictive\nmodels employing variables from stress indicators, cancer history, and\ndemographic data from self-reported surveys, unveiling the direct and immune\nsuppression mitigated connection between chronic stress and cancer occurrence.\nThe models were corroborated by traditional statistical methods. Our findings\nindicated significant causal correlations between stress frequency, stress\nlevel and perceived health impact, and cancer incidence. Although stress alone\nshowed limited predictive power, integrating socio-demographic and familial\ncancer history data significantly enhanced model accuracy. These results\nhighlight the multidimensional nature of cancer risk, with stress emerging as a\nnotable factor alongside genetic predisposition.
