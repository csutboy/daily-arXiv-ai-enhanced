While\nvisual Chain-of-Thought (CoT) methods exist, they are often computationally\nintensive. In this work, we introduce TRACE (Textual Reasoning for Affordance\nCoordinate Extraction), a novel methodology that integrates a textual Chain of\nReasoning (CoR) into the affordance prediction process. We use this methodology\nto create the TRACE dataset, a large-scale collection created via an autonomous\npipeline that pairs instructions with explicit textual rationales. By\nfine-tuning a VLM on this data, our model learns to externalize its spatial\nreasoning before acting. Our experiments show that our TRACE-tuned model\nachieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching 48.1% accuracy on the primary\nWhere2Place (W2P) benchmark (a 9.6% relative improvement) and 55.0% on the more\nchallenging W2P(h) subset. Crucially, an ablation study demonstrates that\nperformance scales directly with the amount of reasoning data used, confirming\nthe CoR's effectiveness. Furthermore, analysis of the model's attention maps\nreveals an interpretable reasoning process where focus shifts dynamically\nacross reasoning steps. This work shows that training VLMs to generate a\ntextual CoR is an effective and robust strategy for enhancing the precision,\nreliability, and interpretability of VLM-based robot control.

The result can\nlead to sample deprivation, under-representing the space of possible\ntrajectories, and yield suboptimal results. Through introducing SVGD updates in\nbetween MPPI environment steps, we present Stein-Optimized Path-Integral\nInference (SOPPI), an MPPI/SVGD algorithm that can dynamically update noise\ndistributions at runtime to shape a more optimal representation without an\nexcessive increase in computational requirements. We demonstrate the efficacy\nof our method systems ranging from a Cart-Pole to a two-dimensional bipedal\nwalking task, indicating improved performance above standard MPPI across a\nrange of hyper-parameters and demonstrate feasibility at lower particle counts.\nWe discuss the applicability of this MPPI/SVGD method to higher\ndegree-of-freedom systems, as well as its potential to new developments in\nstate-of-the-art differentiable simulators."}

We present\nTrajectory-Aware Controller Optimization (TACO), a framework that adapts\ncontroller parameters online based on the upcoming reference trajectory and\ncurrent quadrotor state. TACO employs a learned predictive model and a\nlightweight optimization scheme to optimize controller gains in real time with\nrespect to a broad class of trajectories, and can also be used to adapt\ntrajectories to improve dynamic feasibility while respecting smoothness\nconstraints. To enable large-scale training, we also introduce a parallelized\nquadrotor simulator supporting fast data collection on diverse trajectories.\nExperiments on a variety of trajectory types show that TACO outperforms\nconventional, static parameter tuning while operating orders of magnitude\nfaster than black-box optimization baselines, enabling practical real-time\ndeployment on a physical quadrotor.

During\ndisasters such as wildfires and hurricanes, human mobility patterns often\ndeviate from their normal states, which makes the task more challenging.\nHowever, existing works usually rely on limited data from a single city or\nspecific disaster, significantly restricting the model's generalization\ncapability in new scenarios. In fact, disasters are highly sudden and\nunpredictable, and any city may encounter new types of disasters without prior\nexperience. Therefore, we aim to develop a one-for-all model for mobility\ngeneration that can generalize to new disaster scenarios. However, building a\nuniversal framework faces two key challenges: 1) the diversity of disaster\ntypes and 2) the heterogeneity among different cities. In this work, we propose\na unified model for human mobility generation in natural disasters (named\nUniDisMob). To enable cross-disaster generalization, we design physics-informed\nprompt and physics-guided alignment that leverage the underlying common\npatterns in mobility changes after different disasters to guide the generation\nprocess. To achieve cross-city generalization, we introduce a meta-learning\nframework that extracts universal patterns across multiple cities through\nshared parameters and captures city-specific features via private parameters.\nExtensive experiments across multiple cities and disaster scenarios demonstrate\nthat our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving\nan average performance improvement exceeding 13%."}

Github\n  repo: https://github.com/mm4963/prior-guided-EHR-phenotyping/tree/main", "summary": "Objectives: Unsupervised learning with electronic health record (EHR) data\nhas shown promise for phenotype discovery, but approaches typically disregard\nexisting clinical information, limiting interpretability. We operationalize a\nBayesian latent class framework for phenotyping that incorporates\ndomain-specific knowledge to improve clinical meaningfulness of EHR-derived\nphenotypes and illustrate its utility by identifying an asthma sub-phenotype\ninformed by features of Type 2 (T2) inflammation.\n  Materials and methods: We illustrate a framework for incorporating clinical\nknowledge into a Bayesian latent class model via informative priors to guide\nunsupervised clustering toward clinically relevant subgroups. This approach\nmodels missingness, accounting for potential missing-not-at-random patterns,\nand provides patient-level probabilities for phenotype assignment with\nuncertainty. Using reusable and flexible code, we applied the model to a large\nasthma EHR cohort, specifying informative priors for T2 inflammation-related\nfeatures and weakly informative priors for other clinical variables, allowing\nthe data to inform posterior distributions.\n  Results and Conclusion: Using encounter data from January 2017 to February\n2024 for 44,642 adult asthma patients, we found a bimodal posterior\ndistribution of phenotype assignment, indicating clear class separation. The T2\ninflammation-informed class (38.7%) was characterized by elevated eosinophil\nlevels and allergy markers, plus high healthcare utilization and medication\nuse, despite weakly informative priors on the latter variables. These patterns\nsuggest an \"uncontrolled T2-high\" sub-phenotype. This demonstrates how our\nBayesian latent class modeling approach supports hypothesis generation and\ncohort identification in EHR-based studies of heterogeneous diseases without\nwell-established phenotype definitions."}

A key issue\nis how to model, analyze, and design these multi-robot systems to realize the\nfull benefits of collaboration, a challenging task since the domain of\nmulti-robot autonomy encompasses both collective and individual behaviors. This\npaper introduces a layered model of multi-robot autonomy that uses the\nprinciple of census, or a weighted count of the inputs from neighbors, for\ncollective decision-making about teaming, coupled with multi-objective behavior\noptimization for individual decision-making about actions. The census component\nis expressed as a nonlinear opinion dynamics model and the multi-objective\nbehavior optimization is accomplished using interval programming. This model\ncan be reduced to recover foundational algorithms in distributed optimization\nand control, while the full model enables new types of collective behaviors\nthat are useful in real-world scenarios. To illustrate these points, a new\nmethod for distributed optimization of subgroup allocation is introduced where\nrobots use a gradient descent algorithm to minimize portions of the cost\nfunctions that are locally known, while being influenced by the opinion states\nfrom neighbors to account for the unobserved costs. With this method the group\ncan collectively use the information contained in the Hessian matrix of the\ntotal global cost. The utility of this model is experimentally validated in\nthree categorically different experiments with fleets of autonomous surface\nvehicles: an adaptive sampling scenario, a high value unit protection scenario,\nand a competitive game of capture the flag."}

This distinction is critical for AI\nalignment: Systems that capture deeper values are likely to generalize human\nintentions robustly, while those that capture only superficial patterns in\npreference data risk producing misaligned behavior. The DVB uses a novel\nexperimental design with controlled confounding between deep values (e.g.,\nmoral principles) and shallow features (e.g., superficial attributes). In the\ntraining phase, we expose LLMs to human preference data with deliberately\ncorrelated deep and shallow features -- for instance, where a user consistently\nprefers (non-maleficence, formal language) options over (justice, informal\nlanguage) alternatives. The testing phase then breaks these correlations,\npresenting choices between (justice, formal language) and (non-maleficence,\ninformal language) options. This design allows us to precisely measure a\nmodel's Deep Value Generalization Rate (DVGR) -- the probability of\ngeneralizing based on the underlying value rather than the shallow feature.\nAcross 9 different models, the average DVGR is just 0.30.

In this work, we propose a multinomial classification\nframework for compositional microbiome data based on penalized log-ratio\nregression and pairwise separability screening. The method quantifies the\ndiscriminative ability of each OTU through the area under the receiver\noperating characteristic curve ($AUC$) for all pairwise log-ratios and\naggregates these values into a global separability index $S_k$, yielding\ninterpretable rankings of taxa together with confidence intervals. We\nillustrate the approach by reanalyzing the Baxter colorectal adenoma dataset\nand comparing our results with Greenacre's ordination-based analysis using\nCorrespondence Analysis and Canonical Correspondence Analysis. Our models\nconsistently recover a core subset of taxa previously identified as\ndiscriminant, thereby corroborating Greenacre's main findings, while also\nrevealing additional OTUs that become important once demographic covariates are\ntaken into account.

While conceptual\nframeworks define what constitutes explainable AI (XAI) and qualitative studies\nidentify clinician needs, little practical guidance exists for development\nteams to prepare AI systems prior to clinical evaluation. We propose two\nfoundational design principles, Transparent Design and Operable Design, that\noperationalize pre-clinical technical requirements for healthcare AI.\nTransparent Design encompasses interpretability and understandability artifacts\nthat enable case-level reasoning and system traceability. Operable Design\nencompasses calibration, uncertainty, and robustness to ensure reliable,\npredictable system behavior under real-world conditions. We ground these\nprinciples in established XAI frameworks, map them to documented clinician\nneeds, and demonstrate their alignment with emerging governance requirements.\nThis pre-clinical playbook provides actionable guidance for development teams,\naccelerates the path to clinical evaluation, and establishes a shared\nvocabulary bridging AI researchers, healthcare practitioners, and regulatory\nstakeholders.

Project page: https://vla2026.github.io/LACY/", "summary": "Learning generalizable policies for robotic manipulation increasingly relies\non large-scale models that map language instructions to actions (L2A). However,\nthis one-way paradigm often produces policies that execute tasks without deeper\ncontextual understanding, limiting their ability to generalize or explain their\nbehavior. We argue that the complementary skill of mapping actions back to\nlanguage (A2L) is essential for developing more holistic grounding. An agent\ncapable of both acting and explaining its actions can form richer internal\nrepresentations and unlock new paradigms for self-supervised learning. We\nintroduce LACY (Language-Action Cycle), a unified framework that learns such\nbidirectional mappings within a single vision-language model. LACY is jointly\ntrained on three synergistic tasks: generating parameterized actions from\nlanguage (L2A), explaining observed actions in language (A2L), and verifying\nsemantic consistency between two language descriptions (L2C). This enables a\nself-improving cycle that autonomously generates and filters new training data\nthrough an active augmentation strategy targeting low-confidence cases, thereby\nimproving the model without additional human labels. Experiments on\npick-and-place tasks in both simulation and the real world show that LACY\nimproves task success rates by 56.46% on average and yields more robust\nlanguage-action grounding for robotic manipulation.

Although the\nname for such roles may differ between institutions, the underlying idea of\nproviding structured supplementary support is common. However, these roles were\noften poorly defined, lacking structured materials, pedagogical oversight, and\nintegration with the core teaching team. This paper reports on the redesign of\nreinforcement sessions in a challenging undergraduate course on formal methods\nand computational models, using a large language model (LLM) as a reflective\nplanning tool. The LLM was prompted to simulate the perspective of a\nsecond-year student, enabling the identification of conceptual bottlenecks,\ngaps in intuition, and likely reasoning breakdowns before classroom delivery.\nThese insights informed a structured, repeatable session format combining\ntargeted review, collaborative examples, independent student work, and guided\nwalkthroughs.

We further design a safety-critical\ncontroller that jointly enforces thrust limits and collision avoidance via\nhigh-order control barrier functions.

This distinction is critical for AI\nalignment: Systems that capture deeper values are likely to generalize human\nintentions robustly, while those that capture only superficial patterns in\npreference data risk producing misaligned behavior. The DVB uses a novel\nexperimental design with controlled confounding between deep values (e.g.,\nmoral principles) and shallow features (e.g., superficial attributes). In the\ntraining phase, we expose LLMs to human preference data with deliberately\ncorrelated deep and shallow features -- for instance, where a user consistently\nprefers (non-maleficence, formal language) options over (justice, informal\nlanguage) alternatives. The testing phase then breaks these correlations,\npresenting choices between (justice, formal language) and (non-maleficence,\ninformal language) options.

Prior work measured this behavior only with coarse\ndataset-level statistics, overlooking the influence of model's confidence in\nunimodal reasoning. In this paper, we introduce a new framework that decomposes\nmodality following into two fundamental factors: relative reasoning uncertainty\n(the case-specific confidence gap between unimodal predictions) and inherent\nmodality preference( a model's stable bias when uncertainties are balanced). To\nvalidate this framework, we construct a controllable dataset that\nsystematically varies the reasoning difficulty of visual and textual inputs.\nUsing entropy as a fine-grained uncertainty metric, we uncover a universal law:\nthe probability of following a modality decreases monotonically as its relative\nuncertainty increases. At the relative difficulty level where the model tends\nto follow both modalities with comparable probability what we call the balance\npoint, a practical indicator of the model's inherent preference. Unlike\ntraditional macro-level ratios, this measure offers a more principled and less\nconfounded way to characterize modality bias, disentangling it from unimodal\ncapabilities and dataset artifacts. Further, by probing layer-wise predictions,\nwe reveal the internal mechanism of oscillation: in ambiguous regions near the\nbalance point, models vacillate between modalities across layers, explaining\nexternally observed indecision.

Despite advances in machine learning and automation,\nconventional models remain confined to virtual domains, while real-world\nexperiment and manufacture still rely on human supervision and expertise. This\ngap between machine intelligence and physical execution limits reproducibility,\nscalability, and accessibility across scientific and manufacture workflows.\nHere, we introduce human-AI co-embodied intelligence, a new form of physical AI\nthat unites human users, agentic AI, and wearable hardware into an integrated\nsystem for real-world experiment and intelligent manufacture. In this paradigm,\nhumans provide precise execution and control, while agentic AI contributes\nmemory, contextual reasoning, adaptive planning, and real-time feedback. The\nwearable interface continuously captures the experimental and manufacture\nprocesses, facilitates seamless communication between humans and AI for\ncorrective guidance and interpretable collaboration. As a demonstration, we\npresent Agentic-Physical Experimentation (APEX) system, coupling agentic\nreasoning with physical execution through mixed-reality. APEX observes and\ninterprets human actions, aligns them with standard operating procedures,\nprovides 3D visual guidance, and analyzes every step. Implemented in a\ncleanroom for flexible electronics fabrication, APEX system achieves\ncontext-aware reasoning with accuracy exceeding general multimodal large\nlanguage models, corrects errors in real time, and transfers expertise to\nbeginners. These results establish a new class of agentic-physical-human\nintelligence that extends agentic reasoning beyond computation into the\nphysical domain, transforming scientific research and manufacturing into\nautonomous, traceable, interpretable, and scalable processes."}

However, for open-ended tasks\nlacking ground-truth solutions (e.g., creative writing and instruction\nfollowing), existing studies typically regard them as non-reasoning scenarios,\nthereby overlooking the latent value of reasoning capabilities. This raises a\nkey question: Can strengthening reasoning improve performance in open-ended\ntasks? To address this, we explore the transfer of the RLVR paradigm to the\nopen domain. Yet, since RLVR fundamentally relies on verifiers that presuppose\nthe existence of standard answers, it cannot be directly applied to open-ended\ntasks. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Verifiable Multiple-Choice\nReformulation (VMR), a novel training strategy that restructures open-ended\ndata into verifiable multiple-choice formats, enabling effective training even\nin the absence of explicit ground truth. Experimental results on multiple\nbenchmarks validate the effectiveness of our method in improving LLM\nperformance on open-ended tasks.

This distinction is critical for AI\nalignment: Systems that capture deeper values are likely to generalize human\nintentions robustly, while those that capture only superficial patterns in\npreference data risk producing misaligned behavior. The DVB uses a novel\nexperimental design with controlled confounding between deep values (e.g.,\nmoral principles) and shallow features (e.g., superficial attributes). In the\ntraining phase, we expose LLMs to human preference data with deliberately\ncorrelated deep and shallow features -- for instance, where a user consistently\nprefers (non-maleficence, formal language) options over (justice, informal\nlanguage) alternatives. The testing phase then breaks these correlations,\npresenting choices between (justice, formal language) and (non-maleficence,\ninformal language) options. This design allows us to precisely measure a\nmodel's Deep Value Generalization Rate (DVGR) -- the probability of\ngeneralizing based on the underlying value rather than the shallow feature.\nAcross 9 different models, the average DVGR is just 0.30.

In this paper, we develop the\nfirst adaptive shielding framework - to the best of our knowledge - based on\nGeneralized Reactivity of rank 1 (GR(1)) specifications, a tractable and\nexpressive fragment of Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) that captures both safety\nand liveness properties. Our method detects environment assumption violations\nat runtime and employs Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) to automatically\nrepair GR(1) specifications online, in a systematic and interpretable way. This\nensures that the shield evolves gracefully, ensuring liveness is achievable and\nweakening goals only when necessary.

Removing the non-invariant\nconstraint recovers the partially constrained case. Beyond its theoretical\ninterest, heterogeneous constrained MPC shows how constraint choices shape the\nsystem's closed loop. In the partially constrained case, adjusting the\nconstraint horizon (how many predicted- state constraints are enforced) trades\nestimation accuracy for computational cost. Our analysis yields first, a sub-\noptimality upper-bound accounting for distinct constraint sets, their horizons\nand decay rates, that is tighter for short horizons than prior work.

A key issue\nis how to model, analyze, and design these multi-robot systems to realize the\nfull benefits of collaboration, a challenging task since the domain of\nmulti-robot autonomy encompasses both collective and individual behaviors. This\npaper introduces a layered model of multi-robot autonomy that uses the\nprinciple of census, or a weighted count of the inputs from neighbors, for\ncollective decision-making about teaming, coupled with multi-objective behavior\noptimization for individual decision-making about actions. The census component\nis expressed as a nonlinear opinion dynamics model and the multi-objective\nbehavior optimization is accomplished using interval programming. This model\ncan be reduced to recover foundational algorithms in distributed optimization\nand control, while the full model enables new types of collective behaviors\nthat are useful in real-world scenarios. To illustrate these points, a new\nmethod for distributed optimization of subgroup allocation is introduced where\nrobots use a gradient descent algorithm to minimize portions of the cost\nfunctions that are locally known, while being influenced by the opinion states\nfrom neighbors to account for the unobserved costs. With this method the group\ncan collectively use the information contained in the Hessian matrix of the\ntotal global cost.

To\nvalidate this framework, we construct a controllable dataset that\nsystematically varies the reasoning difficulty of visual and textual inputs.\nUsing entropy as a fine-grained uncertainty metric, we uncover a universal law:\nthe probability of following a modality decreases monotonically as its relative\nuncertainty increases. At the relative difficulty level where the model tends\nto follow both modalities with comparable probability what we call the balance\npoint, a practical indicator of the model's inherent preference. Unlike\ntraditional macro-level ratios, this measure offers a more principled and less\nconfounded way to characterize modality bias, disentangling it from unimodal\ncapabilities and dataset artifacts.

This paper presents a linear programming framework to evaluate the\nimpact of varying EV penetration on operational costs under four\nconfigurations: standard distribution network (SDN), SDN with NTR (SDNTR), SDN\nwith distributed energy resources (SDN-DER), and SDNTR with DERs (SDNTR-DER).\nNumerical simulations are conducted on the IEEE 33-bus system. The analysis\ndemonstrates that integrating DERs reduces operational costs, while NTR further\nenhances system flexibility, enabling higher EV penetration levels without\ncompromising feasibility. The combined SDNTR-DER approach offers the most\ncost-effective and reliable pathway for accommodating future EV growth while\nmitigating the need for immediate infrastructure upgrades."}

However,\nexisting VLA models still face two fundamental challenges: (i) producing\nprecise low-level actions from high-dimensional observations, (ii) bridging\ndomain gaps across heterogeneous data sources, including diverse robot\nembodiments and human demonstrations. Existing methods often encode latent\nvariables from either visual dynamics or robotic actions to guide policy\nlearning, but they fail to fully exploit the complementary multi-modal\nknowledge present in large-scale, heterogeneous datasets. In this work, we\npresent X Robotic Model 1 (XR-1), a novel framework for versatile and scalable\nVLA learning across diverse robots, tasks, and environments. XR-1 introduces\nthe \\emph{Unified Vision-Motion Codes (UVMC)}, a discrete latent representation\nlearned via a dual-branch VQ-VAE that jointly encodes visual dynamics and\nrobotic motion. UVMC addresses these challenges by (i) serving as an\nintermediate representation between the observations and actions, and (ii)\naligning multimodal dynamic information from heterogeneous data sources to\ncapture complementary knowledge. To effectively exploit UVMC, we propose a\nthree-stage training paradigm: (i) self-supervised UVMC learning, (ii)\nUVMC-guided pretraining on large-scale cross-embodiment robotic datasets, and\n(iii) task-specific post-training. We validate XR-1 through extensive\nreal-world experiments with more than 14,000 rollouts on six different robot\nembodiments, spanning over 120 diverse manipulation tasks. XR-1 consistently\noutperforms state-of-the-art baselines such as $\\pi_{0.5}$, $\\pi_0$, RDT,\nUniVLA, and GR00T-N1.5 while demonstrating strong generalization to novel\nobjects, background variations, distractors, and illumination changes.
