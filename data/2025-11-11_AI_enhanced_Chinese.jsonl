The fourth and most recent halving happened in April 2024, cutting the block reward further to 3.125 BTC. If the demand did not decrease simultaneously after these halvings, then the neoclassical economic theory posits that the price of Bitcoin should have increased due to the halving. But did it, in fact, increase for that reason, or is this a post hoc fallacy? This paper uses synthetic control to construct a weighted Bitcoin that is different from its counterpart in one aspect - it did not undergo halving. Comparing the price trajectory of the actual and the simulated Bitcoins, I find evidence of a positive effect of the 2024 Bitcoin halving on its price three months later. The magnitude of this effect is one fifth of the total percentage change in the price of Bitcoin during the study period - from April 2, 2023, to July 21, 2024 (17 months). The second part of the study fails to obtain a statistically significant and robust causal estimate of the effect of the 2020 Bitcoin halving on Bitcoin's price.

This work demonstrates the feasibility of deploying small Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on mobile robots to achieve real-time scene understanding and reasoning under strict computational constraints. Unlike prior approaches that separate perception from mobility, the proposed framework enables simultaneous movement and reasoning in dynamic environments using only on-board hardware. The system integrates a compact VLM with multimodal perception to perform contextual interpretation directly on embedded hardware, eliminating reliance on cloud connectivity. Experimental validation highlights the balance between computational efficiency, task accuracy, and system responsiveness. Implementation on a mobile robot confirms one of the first successful deployments of small VLMs for concurrent reasoning and mobility at the edge.

EviBound is an evidence-bound execution framework that eliminates false claims through dual governance gates requiring machine-checkable evidence.\n  Two complementary gates enforce evidence requirements. The pre-execution Approval Gate validates acceptance criteria schemas before code runs, catching structural violations proactively. The post-execution Verification Gate validates artifacts via MLflow API queries (with recursive path checking) and optionally validates metrics when specified by acceptance criteria. Claims propagate only when backed by a queryable run ID, required artifacts, and FINISHED status. Bounded, confidence-gated retries (typically 1-2 attempts) recover from transient failures without unbounded loops.\n  The framework was evaluated on 8 benchmark tasks spanning infrastructure validation, ML capabilities, and governance stress tests. Baseline A (Prompt-Level Only) yields 100% hallucination (8/8 claimed, 0/8 verified). Baseline B (Verification-Only) reduces hallucination to 25% (2/8 fail verification). EviBound (Dual Gates) achieves 0% hallucination: 7/8 tasks verified and 1 task correctly blocked at the approval gate, all with only approximately 8.3% execution overhead.\n  This package includes execution trajectories, MLflow run IDs for all verified tasks, and a 4-step verification protocol.

Using a simple model, I show that an acquisitive ASI refrains from full predation under surprisingly weak conditions. When humans can flee to rivals, inter-ASI competition creates a market that tempers predation. When trapped by a monopolist ASI, its \"encompassing interest\" in humanity's output makes it a rational autocrat rather than a ravager. And when the ASI has no long-term stake, our ability to withhold future output incentivizes it to trade on credit rather than steal. In each extension, humanity's welfare progressively worsens.

This particularly affects subjects where long-form written work is a key part of assessment. We propose a novel approach to addressing this challenge, using LLMs themselves to support the assessment process. We have developed a proof-of-concept viva voce examination simulator, which accepts the student's written submission as input, generates an interactive series of questions from the LLM and answers from the student. The viva voce simulator is an interactive tool which asks questions which a human examiner might plausibly ask, and uses the student's answers to form a judgment about whether the submitted piece of work is likely to be the student's own work.

However, traditional monolithic architectures, due to their high coupling, are unable to cope with increasingly complex demands in the face of business expansion and increased data volume, resulting in limited platform scalability and decreased data collection efficiency. This article proposes a solution for enterprise big data processing platform based on microservice architecture, based on the concept of Domain Driven Design (DDD). Through in-depth analysis of business requirements, the functional and non functional requirements of the platform in various scenarios were determined, and the DDD method was used to decompose the core business logic into independent microservice modules, enabling data collection, parsing, cleaning, and visualization functions to be independently developed, deployed, and upgraded, thereby improving the flexibility and scalability of the system. This article also designs an automated data collection process based on microservices and proposes an improved dynamic scheduling algorithm to efficiently allocate data collection tasks to Docker nodes, and monitor the collection progress and service status in real time to ensure the accuracy and efficiency of data collection. Through the implementation and testing of the platform, it has been verified that the enterprise big data processing platform based on microservice architecture has significantly improved scalability, data quality, and collection efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u4f01\u4e1a\u5927\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u5e73\u53f0\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u9886\u57df\u9a71\u52a8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u89e3\u6838\u5fc3\u4e1a\u52a1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u96c6\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5355\u4f53\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u4e1a\u52a1\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u589e\u52a0\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u9ad8\u8026\u5408\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u6709\u9650\u548c\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u96c6\u6548\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u590d\u6742\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u9886\u57df\u9a71\u52a8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u6838\u5fc3\u4e1a\u52a1\u903b\u8f91\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u96c6\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u5206\u914d\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u96c6\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u5e73\u53f0\u5b9e\u65bd\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u4f01\u4e1a\u5927\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u5e73\u53f0\u5728\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3001\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u91c7\u96c6\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u67b6\u6784\u7ed3\u5408\u9886\u57df\u9a71\u52a8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4f01\u4e1a\u5927\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u96c6\u3001\u89e3\u6790\u3001\u6e05\u6d17\u548c\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u529f\u80fd\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u5f00\u53d1\u90e8\u7f72\u3002"}}

Instead of handling overidentification by reweighting the data to satisfy the moment conditions (as in Generalized Empirical Likelihood methods), this method proceeds by allowing for errors in the variables of the least mean-square magnitude necessary to simultaneously satisfy all moment conditions. This approach, based on the notions of optimal transport and Wasserstein metric, aims to address the problem of assigning a logical interpretation to GMM results even when overidentification tests reject the null, a situation that cannot always be avoided in applications. We illustrate the method by revisiting Duranton, Morrow and Turner's (2014) study of the relationship between a city's exports and the extent of its transportation infrastructure.

We demonstrate the efficiency, accuracy, and online adaptability of the proposed method across a range of nonlinear systems with varying parametric scenarios, highlighting its potential as a general-purpose tool for fast zero-shot adaptive control.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u5bb6\u65cf\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u51fd\u6570\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u795e\u7ecfODE\u548c\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u79bb\u7ebf\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\u5728\u5904\u7406\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u65f6\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u884c\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u65b0\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u51fd\u6570\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u795e\u7ecfODE\uff08FE-NODE\uff09\u5efa\u6a21\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\uff08DPC\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u79bb\u7ebf\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u663e\u5f0f\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u53c2\u6570\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u5728\u7ebf\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u9002\u5e94\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u6210\u4e3a\u5feb\u901f\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u901a\u7528\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\u4e2d\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u4f18\u5316\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

We define a canonical preference space where each player's relational stance is a normalized vector. This model eliminates the arbitrariness of selecting utility functions, a limitation of recent approaches. We show how classical concepts-bargaining power, dependence, reciprocity-are recovered and generalized within this space. The analysis proceeds in two steps: projecting a game's payoffs and outcomes onto the space, and then reducing the resulting landscape using key metrics. These include a Center of Mass (CoM) and structural indices for Hierarchy (H) and Reciprocity (R). Applications to canonical games (Prisoner's Dilemma, Battle of the Sexes) and economic models (Cournot duopoly) demonstrate that the framework reveals underlying structural similarities across different strategic settings and provides a quantitative characterization of relational dynamics. It thus bridges cooperative and non-cooperative game theory by conceptualizing power as a structural property of the mapping from preferences to equilibria.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u4e8e\u7b56\u7565\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u5206\u6790\u535a\u5f08\u4e2d\u7684\u6743\u529b\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5c06\u73a9\u5bb6\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u7acb\u573a\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u9009\u62e9\u6548\u7528\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u4efb\u610f\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6d88\u9664\u8fd1\u671f\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u6548\u7528\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u4efb\u610f\u6027\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u5206\u6790\u535a\u5f08\u4e2d\u7684\u6743\u529b\u5173\u7cfb\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u6b65\u9aa4\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\uff1a\u5c06\u535a\u5f08\u7684\u6536\u76ca\u548c\u7ed3\u679c\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u504f\u597d\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u4f7f\u7528\u5173\u952e\u6307\u6807\uff08\u8d28\u5fc3\u3001\u5c42\u7ea7\u6307\u6570\u3001\u4e92\u60e0\u6307\u6570\uff09\u7b80\u5316\u7ed3\u679c\u666f\u89c2\u3002", "result": "\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u63ed\u793a\u4e0d\u540c\u7b56\u7565\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u5173\u7cfb\u52a8\u6001\u63d0\u4f9b\u91cf\u5316\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u5728\u7ecf\u5178\u535a\u5f08\u548c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6743\u529b\u6982\u5ff5\u5316\u4e3a\u4ece\u504f\u597d\u5230\u5747\u8861\u6620\u5c04\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u67b6\u8d77\u4e86\u5408\u4f5c\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u4e0e\u975e\u5408\u4f5c\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6865\u6881\u3002"}}

We introduce SMAGDi, a distillation framework that transfers the debate dynamics of a five-agent Llama-based MAS into a compact Socratic decomposer-solver student. SMAGDi represents debate traces as directed interaction graphs, where nodes encode intermediate reasoning steps with correctness labels and edges capture continuity and cross-agent influence. The student is trained with a composite objective combining language modeling, graph-based supervision, contrastive reasoning, and embedding alignment to preserve both fluency and structured reasoning. On StrategyQA and MMLU, SMAGDi compresses a 40B multi-agent system into a 6B student while retaining 88% of its accuracy, substantially outperforming prior distillation methods such as MAGDi, standard KD, and fine-tuned baselines.

Countries are, therefore, naturally interested in projections of progress toward these goals. A variety of statistical measures have been used to report on country-level progress toward the goals, but they have not utilized methodologies explicitly designed to obtain optimally predictive measures of rate of progress as the foundation for projecting trends. The focus of this paper is to provide Bayesian probabilistic projections of progress to SDG indicator 4.1.1, attaining minimum proficiency in reading and mathematics, with particular emphasis on competencies among lower secondary school children. Using data from the OECD PISA, as well as indicators drawn from the World Bank, the OECD, UNDP, and UNESCO, we employ a novel combination of Bayesian latent growth curve modeling Bayesian model averaging to obtain optimal estimates of the rate of progress in minimum proficiency percentages and then use those estimate to develop probabilistic projections into the future overall for all countries in the analysis. Four case study countries are also presented to show how the methods can be used for individual country projections.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4f7f\u7528\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6f5c\u5728\u589e\u957f\u66f2\u7ebf\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6a21\u578b\u5e73\u5747\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u8054\u5408\u56fd\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u53d1\u5c55\u76ee\u68074.1.1\uff08\u521d\u4e2d\u751f\u9605\u8bfb\u548c\u6570\u5b66\u6700\u4f4e\u719f\u7ec3\u5ea6\uff09\u63d0\u4f9b\u6982\u7387\u6027\u8fdb\u5c55\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5404\u56fd\u8feb\u5207\u9700\u8981\u9884\u6d4b\u5230203\u5e74\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u53d1\u5c55\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7edf\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u4e13\u95e8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7528\u4e8e\u83b7\u5f97\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u8fdb\u5c55\u901f\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u6307\u6807\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408OECD PISA\u6570\u636e\u53ca\u4e16\u754c\u94f6\u884c\u3001OECD\u3001UNDP\u3001UNESCO\u7684\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6f5c\u5728\u589e\u957f\u66f2\u7ebf\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6a21\u578b\u5e73\u5747\u7684\u65b0\u9896\u7ec4\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u4f4e\u719f\u7ec3\u5ea6\u767e\u5206\u6bd4\u8fdb\u5c55\u901f\u7387\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u6240\u6709\u5206\u6790\u56fd\u5bb6\u672a\u6765\u7684\u6982\u7387\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u56db\u4e2a\u6848\u4f8b\u56fd\u5bb6\u7684\u4e2a\u4f53\u9884\u6d4b\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u4e3a\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u53d1\u5c55\u76ee\u68074.1.1\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8fdb\u5c55\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5404\u56fd\u5236\u5b9a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6559\u80b2\u653f\u7b56\u3002"}}

Using panel data from Major League Baseball (MLB), this study examines how superstar presence affects teammates' opportunities and career outcomes. To address potential endogeneity in team composition, we exploit plausibly exogenous variation in superstar availability caused by injuries. When a superstar is active in the same team-position unit, non-star teammates play significantly less. These short-term reductions in playing time extend to longer horizons: players who begin their careers alongside a superstar who remains active for a full season (i.e., not on the injured list) are about 1.7 times more likely to exit MLB earlier than comparable peers. A key mechanism is reduced skill development -- limited playing opportunities hinder subsequent growth in offensive performance. At the team level, greater dependence on superstars raises immediate productivity but magnifies performance declines after their departure, indicating a trade-off between short-term success and long-term adaptability. Overall, the findings suggest that while concentrating key roles in top performers boosts output in the short run, it can restrict others' development and retention. Similar dynamics may arise in other organizations that rely heavily on a few exceptional individuals.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8d85\u7ea7\u660e\u661f\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u4f1a\u51cf\u5c11\u961f\u53cb\u7684\u4e0a\u573a\u673a\u4f1a\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u5176\u6280\u80fd\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u66f4\u65e9\u9000\u51fa\u804c\u4e1a\u8054\u76df\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u660e\u661f\u79bb\u5f00\u540e\u9020\u6210\u56e2\u961f\u8868\u73b0\u4e0b\u6ed1\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u8d85\u7ea7\u660e\u661f\u5728\u56e2\u961f\u4e2d\u7684\u4e3b\u5bfc\u5730\u4f4d\u5982\u4f55\u65e0\u610f\u4e2d\u9650\u5236\u5176\u4ed6\u6210\u5458\u7684\u5728\u804c\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u4f1a\u548c\u804c\u4e1a\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u7f8e\u56fd\u804c\u4e1a\u68d2\u7403\u5927\u8054\u76df(MLB)\u7684\u9762\u677f\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u660e\u661f\u7403\u5458\u56e0\u4f24\u7f3a\u9635\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u5916\u751f\u53d8\u5316\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u5f53\u8d85\u7ea7\u660e\u661f\u6d3b\u8dc3\u65f6\uff0c\u975e\u660e\u661f\u961f\u53cb\u4e0a\u573a\u65f6\u95f4\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\uff1b\u4e0e\u660e\u661f\u540c\u961f\u5f00\u59cb\u804c\u4e1a\u751f\u6daf\u7684\u7403\u5458\u63d0\u524d\u9000\u51faMLB\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u589e\u52a01.7\u500d\uff1b\u56e2\u961f\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u660e\u661f\u4f1a\u63d0\u9ad8\u77ed\u671f\u4ea7\u51fa\u4f46\u653e\u5927\u660e\u661f\u79bb\u5f00\u540e\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u4e0b\u6ed1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u5173\u952e\u89d2\u8272\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u9876\u5c16\u4eba\u624d\u8eab\u4e0a\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u77ed\u671f\u4ea7\u51fa\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u9650\u5236\u4ed6\u4eba\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u548c\u7559\u4efb\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u6743\u8861\u5728\u5176\u4ed6\u4f9d\u8d56\u5c11\u6570\u6770\u51fa\u4e2a\u4f53\u7684\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4e2d\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u3002"}}

About 40% believed the victim was at fault, while 43.5% were unsure whether pornographic websites should be banned. Around 11% admitted that they might upload explicit content as revenge, and 8.5% felt that due to cultural taboos around sex, society tends to blame the victim.

However, supply chain finance in China still faces numerous obstacles, such as information asymmetry and inefficient credit transmission chains, hindering its long-term development. This paper designs an operational framework for supply chain finance incorporating blockchain technology, clearly defines the participating entities, and analyzes their business relationships. Based upon evolutionary game theory, a supply chain finance financing game model incorporating blockchain technology is constructed. A comparative analysis of the model's equilibrium points and their stability is conducted.

We study a common two-stage sampling design-random sampling of clusters followed by sampling units within sampled clusters-with treatment assigned at the cluster level. First, we derive the exact (infeasible) design-based variance of the HT ATE estimator that accounts jointly for cluster- and unit-level sampling as well as random assignment. Second, extending Aronow et al (2014), we provide a sharp, attanable upper bound on that variance and propose a consistent estimator of the bound using only observed outcomes and known sampling/assignment probabilities. In simulations and an empirical application, confidence intervals based on our bound are valid and typically narrower than those based on cluster standard errors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6709\u9650\u603b\u4f53\u7fa4\u7ec4\u968f\u673a\u5bf9\u7167\u8bd5\u9a8c\u4e2dHT\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cf\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\u4e0a\u754c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u53ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u5c16\u9510\u4e0a\u754c\u53ca\u5176\u4e00\u81f4\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cf\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u7f6e\u4fe1\u533a\u95f4\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u6709\u9650\u603b\u4f53\u7fa4\u7ec4\u968f\u673a\u5bf9\u7167\u8bd5\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cHT\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cf\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u5dee\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u672a\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u7fa4\u7ec4\u805a\u5408\u6f5c\u5728\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u8054\u5408\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u65e0\u6cd5\u70b9\u8bc6\u522b\u3002\u9700\u8981\u627e\u5230\u53ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\u4e0a\u754c\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u533a\u95f4\u3002", "method": "\u6269\u5c55Aronow\u7b49\u4eba\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86HT ATE\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cf\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5c16\u9510\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u89c2\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u548c\u5df2\u77e5\u62bd\u6837/\u5206\u914d\u6982\u7387\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5e94\u7528\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8be5\u4e0a\u754c\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u533a\u95f4\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u901a\u5e38\u6bd4\u57fa\u4e8e\u7fa4\u7ec4\u6807\u51c6\u8bef\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u533a\u95f4\u66f4\u7a84\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\u4e0a\u754c\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u6709\u9650\u603b\u4f53\u7fa4\u7ec4\u968f\u673a\u5bf9\u7167\u8bd5\u9a8c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u63a8\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7fa4\u7ec4\u6807\u51c6\u8bef\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4fdd\u5b88\u6027\u3002"}}

However, building an intraoperative 3D tumor model for subsequent removal faces major challenges due to the lack of high-fidelity tumor reconstruction, difficulties in developing generalized tissue models to handle the inherent complexities of tumor diagnosis, and the natural physical limitations of bimanual operation, physiologic tremor, and fatigue creep during surgery. To overcome these challenges, we introduce \"TumorMap\", a surgical robotic platform to formulate intraoperative 3D tumor boundaries and achieve autonomous tissue resection using a set of multifunctional lasers. TumorMap integrates a three-laser mechanism (optical coherence tomography, laser-induced endogenous fluorescence, and cutting laser scalpel) combined with deep learning models to achieve fully-automated and noncontact tumor resection. We validated TumorMap in murine osteoscarcoma and soft-tissue sarcoma tumor models, and established a novel histopathological workflow to estimate sensor performance. With submillimeter laser resection accuracy, we demonstrated multimodal sensor-guided autonomous tumor surgery without any human intervention.", "AI": {"tldr": "TumorMap\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u624b\u672f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u6210\u4e09\u79cd\u6fc0\u5149\uff08\u5149\u5b66\u76f8\u5e72\u65ad\u5c42\u626b\u63cf\u3001\u6fc0\u5149\u8bf1\u5bfc\u5185\u6e90\u6027\u8367\u5149\u548c\u5207\u5272\u6fc0\u5149\u624b\u672f\u5200\uff09\u7ed3\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u672f\u4e2d3D\u80bf\u7624\u8fb9\u754c\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u81ea\u4e3b\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5207\u9664\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u6076\u6027\u80bf\u7624\u624b\u672f\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u80bf\u7624\u91cd\u5efa\u3001\u96be\u4ee5\u5f00\u53d1\u901a\u7528\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u80bf\u7624\u8bca\u65ad\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u624b\u672f\u4e2d\u53cc\u624b\u64cd\u4f5c\u3001\u751f\u7406\u9707\u98a4\u548c\u75b2\u52b3\u7b49\u7269\u7406\u9650\u5236\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u96c6\u6210\u4e09\u6fc0\u5149\u673a\u5236\uff08\u5149\u5b66\u76f8\u5e72\u65ad\u5c42\u626b\u63cf\u7528\u4e8e\u6210\u50cf\u3001\u6fc0\u5149\u8bf1\u5bfc\u5185\u6e90\u6027\u8367\u5149\u7528\u4e8e\u8bca\u65ad\u3001\u5207\u5272\u6fc0\u5149\u624b\u672f\u5200\u7528\u4e8e\u5207\u9664\uff09\u7ed3\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u975e\u63a5\u89e6\u5f0f\u80bf\u7624\u5207\u9664\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u9f20\u9aa8\u8089\u7624\u548c\u8f6f\u7ec4\u7ec7\u8089\u7624\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7ec4\u7ec7\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e9a\u6beb\u7c73\u7ea7\u6fc0\u5149\u5207\u9664\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5f15\u5bfc\u81ea\u4e3b\u80bf\u7624\u624b\u672f\u3002", "conclusion": "TumorMap\u5e73\u53f0\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u5e72\u9884\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5f15\u5bfc\u81ea\u4e3b\u80bf\u7624\u624b\u672f\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u4e9a\u6beb\u7c73\u7ea7\u5207\u9664\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002"}}

In this paper, we introduce a log-linear backstepping control law on SE2(3) that preserves full rotational-translational coupling. Leveraging a class of mixed-invariant system, which is a group-affine dynamic model, we derive exact logarithmic error dynamics that are linear in the Lie algebra. The closed-form expressions for the left- and right-Jacobian inverses of SE2(3) are expressed in the paper, which provides us the exact error dynamics without local approximations. A log-linear backstepping control design ensures exponential stability for our error dynamics; since our error dynamics is a block-triangular structure, this allows us to use Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) formulation or $H_\\infty$ gain performance design.

We analyze constitutional, collective-choice, and operational rules shaping AI uptake in two contrasting GCC members, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Kuwait, and whether they foster citizen centricity, collaborative governance, and public value creation. Anchored in Ostrom's Institutional Analysis and Development framework, the study combines a most similar/most different systems design with multiple sources: 62 public documents from 2018--2025, embedded UAE cases (Smart Dubai and MBZUAI), and 39 interviews with officials conducted Aug 2024--May 2025. Dual coding and process tracing connect rule configurations to AI performance. Cross-case analysis identifies four reinforcing mechanisms behind divergent trajectories. In the UAE, concentrated authority, credible sanctions, pro-innovation narratives, and flexible reinvestment rules scale pilots into hundreds of services and sizable recycled savings. In Kuwait, dispersed veto points, exhortative sanctions, cautious discourse, and lapsed AI budgets confine initiatives to pilot mode despite equivalent fiscal resources. The findings refine institutional theory by showing that vertical rule coherence, not wealth, determines AI's public-value yield, and temper post-NPM optimism by revealing that efficiency metrics serve societal goals only when backed by enforceable safeguards. To curb ethics washing and test transferability beyond the GCC, future work should track rule diffusion over time, develop blended legitimacy--efficiency scorecards, and examine how narrative framing shapes citizen consent for data sharing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u963f\u8054\u914b\u548c\u79d1\u5a01\u7279\u5728\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5e94\u7528\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5236\u5ea6\u89c4\u5219\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5782\u76f4\u89c4\u5219\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff08\u800c\u975e\u8d22\u5bcc\uff09\u51b3\u5b9a\u4e86AI\u7684\u516c\u5171\u4ef7\u503c\u4ea7\u51fa\u3002\u963f\u8054\u914b\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u4e2d\u6743\u5a01\u3001\u53ef\u4fe1\u5236\u88c1\u7b49\u673a\u5236\u6210\u529f\u6269\u5c55AI\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u800c\u79d1\u5a01\u7279\u56e0\u5206\u6563\u7684\u5426\u51b3\u6743\u7b49\u9650\u5236\u4f7fAI\u9879\u76ee\u505c\u7559\u5728\u8bd5\u70b9\u9636\u6bb5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u897f\u65b9\u6c11\u4e3b\u56fd\u5bb6\uff0c\u6d77\u6e7e\u5408\u4f5c\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u56fd\u5bb6\u5982\u4f55\u5c06AI\u96c4\u5fc3\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u540e\u65b0\u516c\u5171\u7ba1\u7406\u6210\u679c\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\u8bc1\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u5206\u6790\u963f\u8054\u914b\u548c\u79d1\u5a01\u7279\u4e24\u56fd\u5236\u5ea6\u89c4\u5219\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cdAI\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u662f\u5426\u4fc3\u8fdb\u516c\u6c11\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6027\u3001\u534f\u4f5c\u6cbb\u7406\u548c\u516c\u5171\u4ef7\u503c\u521b\u9020\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5965\u65af\u7279\u7f57\u59c6\u7684\u5236\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u53d1\u5c55\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6700\u76f8\u4f3c/\u6700\u4e0d\u540c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u7ed3\u540862\u4efd\u516c\u5171\u6587\u4ef6\uff082018-2025\uff09\u3001\u963f\u8054\u914b\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u6848\u4f8b\uff08\u667a\u80fd\u8fea\u62dc\u548cMBZUAI\uff09\u4ee5\u53ca39\u6b21\u5b98\u5458\u8bbf\u8c08\uff082024\u5e748\u6708-2025\u5e745\u6708\uff09\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u53cc\u91cd\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8ffd\u8e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u963f\u8054\u914b\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u4e2d\u6743\u5a01\u3001\u53ef\u4fe1\u5236\u88c1\u3001\u521b\u65b0\u53d9\u4e8b\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u518d\u6295\u8d44\u89c4\u5219\u5c06\u8bd5\u70b9\u6269\u5c55\u4e3a\u6570\u767e\u9879\u670d\u52a1\u548c\u53ef\u89c2\u56de\u6536\u50a8\u84c4\uff1b\u79d1\u5a01\u7279\u56e0\u5206\u6563\u5426\u51b3\u70b9\u3001\u529d\u8beb\u6027\u5236\u88c1\u3001\u8c28\u614e\u8bba\u8ff0\u548c\u5931\u6548AI\u9884\u7b97\u4f7f\u9879\u76ee\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u8bd5\u70b9\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u8d22\u653f\u8d44\u6e90\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5782\u76f4\u89c4\u5219\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff08\u800c\u975e\u8d22\u5bcc\uff09\u51b3\u5b9a\u4e86AI\u7684\u516c\u5171\u4ef7\u503c\u4ea7\u51fa\uff0c\u6548\u7387\u6307\u6807\u53ea\u6709\u5728\u6709\u5f3a\u5236\u4fdd\u969c\u65f6\u624d\u670d\u52a1\u4e8e\u793e\u4f1a\u76ee\u6807\u3002\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u5e94\u8ffd\u8e2a\u89c4\u5219\u6269\u6563\u3001\u5f00\u53d1\u6df7\u5408\u5408\u6cd5\u6027-\u6548\u7387\u8bc4\u5206\u5361\uff0c\u5e76\u8003\u5bdf\u53d9\u4e8b\u6846\u67b6\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u516c\u6c11\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u540c\u610f\u3002"}}

Deploying these models requires energy-intensive GPU infrastructure, and in some cases has even prompted plans to power data centers with nuclear energy. Despite this growing relevance, systematic analyses of inference energy consumption remain limited. In this work, we present a large-scale measurement-based study comprising over 32,500 measurements across 21 GPU configurations and 155 model architectures, from small open-source models to frontier systems. Using the vLLM inference engine, we quantify energy usage at the prompt level and identify how architectural and operational factors shape energy demand. Building on these insights, we develop a predictive model that accurately estimates inference energy consumption across unseen architectures and hardware, and implement it as a browser extension to raise awareness of the environmental impact of generative AI.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6d4b\u91cf\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u80fd\u8017\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u4f30\u7b97\u4e0d\u540c\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u80fd\u8017\uff0c\u5e76\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u6d4f\u89c8\u5668\u6269\u5c55\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u73af\u5883\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u6269\u5c55\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u524d\u6240\u672a\u6709\u7684\u80fd\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u63a8\u7406\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5f80\u5f80\u4e3b\u5bfc\u6574\u4e2a\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u7684\u80fd\u8017\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u90e8\u7f72\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u8981\u80fd\u6e90\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684GPU\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u8017\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u4ecd\u7136\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u8d85\u8fc732,500\u6b21\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u6db5\u76d621\u79cdGPU\u914d\u7f6e\u548c155\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u4ece\u5c0f\u578b\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u5230\u524d\u6cbf\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u4f7f\u7528vLLM\u63a8\u7406\u5f15\u64ce\u5728\u63d0\u793a\u7ea7\u522b\u91cf\u5316\u80fd\u8017\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u56e0\u7d20\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u80fd\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6d1e\u5bdf\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u4f30\u7b97\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u8017\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e3a\u6d4f\u89c8\u5668\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u586b\u8865\u4e86LLM\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u8017\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u610f\u8bc6\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u7684\u73af\u5883\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

GenAI can potentially both enable previously unviable entrepreneurial ideas by lowering resource needs and improve the performance of existing ventures. We explore how founders' technical and managerial expertise shapes GenAI's impact on digital ventures along these dimensions. Exploiting exogenous variation in GenAI usage across venture categories and the timing of its broad availability for software tasks (e.g., GitHub Copilot's public release and subsequent GenAI tools), we find that the number of new venture launches increased and the median time to launch decreased significantly more in categories with relatively high GenAI usage. GenAI's effect on new launches is larger for founders without managerial experience or education, while its effect on venture capital (VC) funding likelihood is stronger for founders with technical experience or education. Overall, our results suggest that GenAI expands access to digital entrepreneurship for founders lacking managerial expertise and enhances venture performance among technical founders.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u6570\u5b57\u521b\u4e1a\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4f7f\u66f4\u591a\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u521b\u4e1a\u60f3\u6cd5\u53d8\u5f97\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u73b0\u6709\u4f01\u4e1a\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5728GenAI\u4f7f\u7528\u7387\u9ad8\u7684\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u65b0\u4f01\u4e1a\u6570\u91cf\u589e\u52a0\u4e14\u542f\u52a8\u65f6\u95f4\u7f29\u77ed\uff0c\u5bf9\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7ba1\u7406\u7ecf\u9a8c\u521b\u59cb\u4eba\u5f71\u54cd\u66f4\u5927\uff0c\u800c\u5bf9\u6709\u6280\u672f\u80cc\u666f\u521b\u59cb\u4eba\u7684VC\u878d\u8d44\u5f71\u54cd\u66f4\u5f3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u964d\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\u5f71\u54cd\u6570\u5b57\u521b\u4e1a\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u521b\u59cb\u4eba\u6280\u672f\u548c\u7ba1\u7406\u4e13\u957f\u5982\u4f55\u8c03\u8282\u8fd9\u79cd\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u8de8\u521b\u4e1a\u7c7b\u522bGenAI\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u5916\u751f\u53d8\u5f02\u548cGenAI\u5de5\u5177\u516c\u5f00\u53d1\u5e03\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u65b0\u4f01\u4e1a\u542f\u52a8\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u901f\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "GenAI\u4f7f\u7528\u7387\u9ad8\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\u65b0\u4f01\u4e1a\u6570\u91cf\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u542f\u52a8\u65f6\u95f4\u7f29\u77ed\uff1b\u5bf9\u65e0\u7ba1\u7406\u7ecf\u9a8c\u521b\u59cb\u4eba\u542f\u52a8\u5f71\u54cd\u66f4\u5927\uff0c\u5bf9\u6709\u6280\u672f\u80cc\u666f\u521b\u59cb\u4eba\u878d\u8d44\u5f71\u54cd\u66f4\u5f3a\u3002", "conclusion": "GenAI\u4e3a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7ba1\u7406\u4e13\u957f\u7684\u521b\u59cb\u4eba\u6269\u5927\u4e86\u6570\u5b57\u521b\u4e1a\u673a\u4f1a\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6709\u6280\u672f\u80cc\u666f\u521b\u59cb\u4eba\u7684\u4f01\u4e1a\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

This study synthesizes evidence from multiple clinical trials to evaluate the effectiveness of fluoride varnish in reducing Decayed-Missing-Filled (DMF) surfaces. The principal measure of efficacy is the Prevented Fraction (PF), representing the proportional reduction in caries relative to untreated controls. A comprehensive meta-analysis was conducted using fixed-effect and random-effects models, complemented by hierarchical Bayesian inference. The Bayesian framework incorporated multiple prior distributions on between-study variance, including Pareto, half-normal, uniform, beta, and scaled chi-square forms, to assess robustness under alternative heterogeneity assumptions. Across all specifications, the pooled estimate indicated an approximate 43% reduction in caries incidence, with credible intervals consistently excluding the null. Compared to classical methods, the Bayesian approach provided richer uncertainty quantification through full posterior distributions, allowed principled incorporation of prior evidence, and offered improved inference under heterogeneity and small-sample conditions. The stability of posterior estimates across diverse priors reinforces the robustness and reliability of the conclusions. Overall, findings confirm fluoride varnish as an effective and consistent preventive measure, and demonstrate the value of Bayesian hierarchical modeling as a powerful complement to traditional meta-analytic techniques in dental public health research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u835f\u8403\u5206\u6790\u8bc4\u4f30\u6c1f\u5316\u7269\u6f06\u5bf9\u51cf\u5c11\u9f8b\u9f7f\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5c42\u6b21\u6a21\u578b\u5f97\u51fa\u6c1f\u5316\u7269\u6f06\u53ef\u964d\u4f4e\u7ea643%\u7684\u9f8b\u9f7f\u53d1\u75c5\u7387\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u7a33\u5065\u53ef\u9760\u3002", "motivation": "\u9f8b\u9f7f\u662f\u5168\u7403\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u5065\u5eb7\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u6c1f\u5316\u7269\u6f06\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9884\u9632\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u968f\u673a\u6548\u5e94\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u835f\u8403\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u5c42\u6b21\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u65ad\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u79cd\u5148\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u8bc4\u4f30\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u683c\u4e0b\uff0c\u6c47\u603b\u4f30\u8ba1\u663e\u793a\u9f8b\u9f7f\u53d1\u75c5\u7387\u964d\u4f4e\u7ea643%\uff0c\u53ef\u4fe1\u533a\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6392\u9664\u96f6\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6c1f\u5316\u7269\u6f06\u662f\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u9884\u9632\u63aa\u65bd\uff0c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5c42\u6b21\u5efa\u6a21\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f20\u7edf\u835f\u8403\u5206\u6790\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u8865\u5145\u5728\u7259\u79d1\u516c\u5171\u536b\u751f\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

We build a discrete choice model that embeds recommendation-induced utility, low-rank heterogeneity, and flexible state dependence and apply the model to viewership data at Netflix. We exploit idiosyncratic variation introduced by the recommendation algorithm to identify and separately value these components as well as to recover model-free diversion ratios that we can use to validate our structural model. We use the model to evaluate counterfactuals that quantify the incremental engagement generated by personalized recommendations. First, we show that replacing the current recommender system with a matrix factorization or popularity-based algorithm would lead to 4% and 12% reduction in engagement, respectively, and decreased consumption diversity.

In order to improve the efficiency of resource allocation and market response, automobile manufacturers need to build a production system that takes into account cost and flexibility. Based on the delayed response manufacturing strategy, this study built an order response node configuration model suitable for automotive manufacturing scenarios, focusing on the positioning of order driven intervention points in the production process. The model comprehensively considers the structural cost changes brought by process adjustment, the dynamic characteristics of the changes of unit manufacturing cost and intermediate inventory cost at different stages with the location of nodes, and introduces delivery time constraints to embed time factors into the inventory decision logic to enhance the practicality of the model and the adaptation of realistic constraints. In terms of solution methods, this paper adopts function fitting and simulation analysis methods, combined with mathematical modeling tools, systematically describes the change trend of total cost, and verifies the rationality and effectiveness of the model structure and solution through actual enterprise cases. The research results provide a theoretical basis and decision support for automobile manufacturing enterprises to realize the synergy of flexible production and cost control in the environment of variable demand, and also provide an empirical reference for the implementation path and system optimization of subsequent relevant strategies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u57fa\u4e8e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u54cd\u5e94\u5236\u9020\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6c7d\u8f66\u5236\u9020\u573a\u666f\u7684\u8ba2\u5355\u54cd\u5e94\u8282\u70b9\u914d\u7f6e\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u5e73\u8861\u67d4\u6027\u751f\u4ea7\u4e0e\u6210\u672c\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u6c7d\u8f66\u5236\u9020\u4f01\u4e1a\u5728\u9700\u6c42\u591a\u53d8\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d44\u6e90\u4f18\u5316\u914d\u7f6e\u63d0\u4f9b\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u751f\u4ea7\u6a21\u5f0f\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u5ba2\u6237\u5bf9\u5dee\u5f02\u5316\u548c\u5feb\u901f\u4ea4\u4ed8\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u671f\u671b\uff0c\u6c7d\u8f66\u5236\u9020\u5546\u9700\u8981\u6784\u5efa\u517c\u987e\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u67d4\u6027\u7684\u751f\u4ea7\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u8d44\u6e90\u914d\u7f6e\u6548\u7387\u548c\u5e02\u573a\u54cd\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u51fd\u6570\u62df\u5408\u548c\u4eff\u771f\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6570\u5b66\u5efa\u6a21\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u8ba2\u5355\u54cd\u5e94\u8282\u70b9\u914d\u7f6e\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7efc\u5408\u8003\u8651\u5de5\u827a\u8c03\u6574\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u6210\u672c\u53d8\u5316\u3001\u4e0d\u540c\u9636\u6bb5\u5355\u4f4d\u5236\u9020\u6210\u672c\u548c\u4e2d\u95f4\u5e93\u5b58\u6210\u672c\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4ea4\u4ed8\u65f6\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9645\u4f01\u4e1a\u6848\u4f8b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u6c42\u89e3\u7684\u5408\u7406\u6027\u4e0e\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e86\u603b\u6210\u672c\u53d8\u5316\u8d8b\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u679c\u4e3a\u6c7d\u8f66\u5236\u9020\u4f01\u4e1a\u5728\u9700\u6c42\u591a\u53d8\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u67d4\u6027\u751f\u4ea7\u4e0e\u6210\u672c\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u534f\u540c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u76f8\u5173\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5b9e\u65bd\u8def\u5f84\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u53c2\u8003\u3002"}}

While each choice of $\u03c9$ may be defensible in empirical contexts that motivate a particular method, it relies on fundamentally untestable and often fragile assumptions. I develop an identification framework that allows for all weights satisfying a Synthetic Parallel Trends assumption: the treated unit's trend is parallel to a weighted combination of control units' trends for a general class of weights. The framework nests these existing methods as special cases and is by construction robust to violations of their respective assumptions. I construct a valid confidence set for the identified set of the treatment effect, which admits a linear programming representation with estimated coefficients and nuisance parameters that are profiled out. In simulations where the assumptions underlying DID or SC-based methods are violated, the proposed confidence set remains robust and attains nominal coverage, while existing methods suffer severe undercoverage.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u653f\u7b56\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06DID\u548cSC\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7279\u4f8b\u5305\u542b\u5728\u5185\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u5e73\u884c\u8d8b\u52bf\u5047\u8bbe\u6784\u5efa\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u96c6\uff0c\u5728\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u88ab\u8fdd\u53cd\u65f6\u4ecd\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u540d\u4e49\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9762\u677f\u6570\u636e\u653f\u7b56\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982DID\u3001SC\u7b49\uff09\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u6743\u91cd\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5047\u8bbe\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u4e0d\u53ef\u68c0\u9a8c\u4e14\u8106\u5f31\u7684\uff0c\u5f53\u5047\u8bbe\u88ab\u8fdd\u53cd\u65f6\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u4e0d\u8db3\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bc6\u522b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u6240\u6709\u6ee1\u8db3\u5408\u6210\u5e73\u884c\u8d8b\u52bf\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u8868\u793a\u7684\u6709\u6548\u7f6e\u4fe1\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u5256\u6790\u4e86\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cfb\u6570\u548c\u5e72\u6270\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u62df\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5f53DID\u6216SC\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u5047\u8bbe\u88ab\u8fdd\u53cd\u65f6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u96c6\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5065\u5e76\u8fbe\u5230\u540d\u4e49\u8986\u76d6\u7387\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5219\u51fa\u73b0\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u9002\u5e94\u5404\u79cd\u6743\u91cd\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u5728\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5931\u6548\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4ecd\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u63a8\u65ad\u7ed3\u679c\u3002"}}

Here, we present empirical evidence from \\textit{Formica polyctena} ants that reveals a shared statistical mechanism underlying both systems: maximization under different energy function constraints.

MGs and NMGs can operate autonomously in islanded mode, which requires Grid-Forming (GFM) IBRs that can perform black start, synchronization, restoration and regulation. However, such IBRs face synchronization instability issues, which might be worsened by inadequate secondary level frequency and voltage regulation. Accordingly, we propose an autonomous and distributed synchronization and restoration scheme using Distributed-Averaging Proportional-Integral (DAPI) control. To validate the proposed method, we model and simulate a high-fidelity islanded and modified IEEE 123 bus system, modeled as an NMG consisting of 7 MGs.

This paper investigates efficient CoT transfer across models of different scales and architectures through an adaptive reasoning summarization framework. The proposed method compresses reasoning traces via semantic segmentation with importance scoring, budget-aware dynamic compression, and coherence reconstruction, preserving critical reasoning steps while significantly reducing token usage. Experiments on 7{,}501 medical examination questions across 10 specialties show up to 40% higher accuracy than truncation under the same token budgets. Evaluations on 64 model pairs from eight LLMs (1.5B-32B parameters, including DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen3) confirm strong cross-model transferability. Furthermore, a Gaussian Process-based Bayesian optimization module reduces evaluation cost by 84% and reveals a power-law relationship between model size and cross-domain robustness. These results demonstrate that reasoning summarization provides a practical path toward efficient CoT transfer, enabling advanced reasoning under tight computational constraints.

Evidence from India", "comment": null, "summary": "This paper examines the causal effect of urban local governance on public goods provision in India. We exploit quasi-random variation in multi-threshold criteria utilized for classifying Census Towns (CTs) and focus on settlements near the thresholds that are likely to obtain statutory recognition. Using a fuzzy regression discontinuity design, we instrument for urban local governance to identify the Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE). We document a strong first stage relationship between meeting CT thresholds and statutory recognition. Our results show that obtaining an Urban Local Body (ULB) increases local public good provision: government schools increase by approximately 14 (primary), 8 (middle), and 5 (secondary), healthcare infrastructure expands by 2 hospitals and 3 family welfare centers, and financial access deepens with 15 private banks, 2 cooperative banks, and 2 agricultural credit societies. Community amenities improve modestly with an additional public library, reading room, and cinema hall. Sports infrastructure declines by 5 facilities, consistent with our understanding of reallocation of urban space and investments. Our findings suggest that timely municipalization of emerging urban areas can expand provision of certain public goods, which may improve living standards and economic opportunities in urbanizing economies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4f7f\u7528\u6a21\u7cca\u65ad\u70b9\u56de\u5f52\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7814\u7a76\u5370\u5ea6\u57ce\u5e02\u5730\u65b9\u6cbb\u7406\u5bf9\u516c\u5171\u7269\u54c1\u4f9b\u7ed9\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u83b7\u5f97\u57ce\u5e02\u5730\u65b9\u673a\u6784\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\u6559\u80b2\u3001\u533b\u7597\u548c\u91d1\u878d\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u51cf\u5c11\u4f53\u80b2\u8bbe\u65bd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u57ce\u5e02\u5730\u65b9\u6cbb\u7406\u5bf9\u516c\u5171\u7269\u54c1\u4f9b\u7ed9\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5370\u5ea6\u5feb\u901f\u57ce\u5e02\u5316\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e86\u89e3\u53ca\u65f6\u8bbe\u7acb\u5e02\u653f\u673a\u6784\u5bf9\u6539\u5584\u516c\u5171\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u4eba\u53e3\u666e\u67e5\u57ce\u9547\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u591a\u9608\u503c\u6807\u51c6\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u51c6\u968f\u673a\u53d8\u5f02\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6a21\u7cca\u65ad\u70b9\u56de\u5f52\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u83b7\u5f97\u57ce\u5e02\u5730\u65b9\u673a\u6784\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u5e73\u5747\u5904\u7406\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u83b7\u5f97\u57ce\u5e02\u5730\u65b9\u673a\u6784\u4f7f\u653f\u5e9c\u5b66\u6821\u6570\u91cf\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\uff08\u5c0f\u5b6614\u6240\u3001\u521d\u4e2d8\u6240\u3001\u9ad8\u4e2d5\u6240\uff09\uff0c\u533b\u7597\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u589e\u52a0\uff082\u5bb6\u533b\u9662\u548c3\u4e2a\u5bb6\u5ead\u798f\u5229\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff09\uff0c\u91d1\u878d\u63a5\u5165\u6df1\u5316\uff0815\u5bb6\u79c1\u4eba\u94f6\u884c\u30012\u5bb6\u5408\u4f5c\u94f6\u884c\u548c2\u5bb6\u519c\u4e1a\u4fe1\u8d37\u534f\u4f1a\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u4f53\u80b2\u8bbe\u65bd\u51cf\u5c115\u4e2a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53ca\u65f6\u4e3a\u65b0\u5174\u57ce\u5e02\u533a\u57df\u8bbe\u7acb\u5e02\u653f\u673a\u6784\u53ef\u4ee5\u6269\u5927\u67d0\u4e9b\u516c\u5171\u7269\u54c1\u7684\u4f9b\u7ed9\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u6539\u5584\u57ce\u5e02\u5316\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4f53\u7684\u751f\u6d3b\u6c34\u5e73\u548c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u673a\u4f1a\u3002"}}

Molstad"], "title": "A unified approach to spatial domain detection and cell-type deconvolution in spot-based spatial transcriptomics", "comment": null, "summary": "Many popular technologies for generating spatially resolved transcriptomic (SRT) data measure gene expression at the resolution of a \"spot\", i.e., a small tissue region 55 microns in diameter. Each spot can contain many cells of different types. In typical analyses, researchers are interested in using these data to identify discrete spatial domains in the tissue. In this paper, we propose a new method, DUET, that simultaneously identifies discrete spatial domains and estimates each spot's cell-type proportion.

While such depth promotes efficiency, it may also limit adaptability in complex and rapidly changing environments. Building on research showing that variability in training inputs enhances learning outcomes across cognitive and behavioral domains, this study explores whether the same principle applies to executive performance.\n  Using an original dataset of 650 CEOs leading firms that together represent roughly 85% of US market capitalization, we construct a composite Breadth Index capturing cross-domain educational and professional breadth. Preliminary analyses reveal that firms led by higher-breadth CEOs outperform their industry peers by an average of 9.8 percentage points over a three-year window. Regression results indicate that each one-point increase on the five-point Range Index corresponds to a 1.8-point gain in abnormal returns (p < 0.03), with effects remaining robust across industries, firm sizes, and CEO age groups.\n  These early findings suggest that leadership breadth, defined as experience spanning multiple functions, disciplines, and sectors, is positively associated with firm-level performance. While the dataset remains under validation, the pattern observed supports the emerging view that as specialization deepens, the marginal value of lateral insight rises. Breadth, in this light, functions as a form of adaptive capital; it enhances leaders' capacity for integrative reasoning, organizational translation, and strategic flexibility in uncertain environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0CEO\u7684\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5e7f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u4f01\u4e1a\u7ee9\u6548\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u5e7f\u5ea6\u6307\u6570\u6bcf\u589e\u52a01\u70b9\u5bf9\u5e941.8%\u7684\u8d85\u989d\u56de\u62a5\u589e\u957f", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u804c\u4e1a\u548c\u6559\u80b2\u7cfb\u7edf\u5956\u52b1\u65e9\u671f\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u80fd\u9650\u5236\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5feb\u901f\u53d8\u5316\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u7ecf\u9a8c\u662f\u5426\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u7ba1\u8868\u73b0", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528650\u4f4dCEO\u7684\u539f\u521b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6784\u5efa\u5e7f\u5ea6\u6307\u6570\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u6559\u80b2\u548c\u804c\u4e1a\u5e7f\u5ea6\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u56de\u5f52\u5206\u6790", "result": "\u9ad8\u5e7f\u5ea6CEO\u9886\u5bfc\u7684\u516c\u53f8\u4e09\u5e74\u5185\u5e73\u5747\u6bd4\u884c\u4e1a\u540c\u884c\u8868\u73b0\u597d9.8\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff0c\u5e7f\u5ea6\u6307\u6570\u6bcf\u589e\u52a01\u70b9\u5bf9\u5e941.8\u70b9\u5f02\u5e38\u56de\u62a5\u589e\u957f", "conclusion": "\u9886\u5bfc\u529b\u5e7f\u5ea6\uff08\u8de8\u804c\u80fd\u3001\u5b66\u79d1\u548c\u90e8\u95e8\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\uff09\u4e0e\u4f01\u4e1a\u7ee9\u6548\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u5728\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u52a0\u6df1\u65f6\uff0c\u6a2a\u5411\u6d1e\u5bdf\u529b\u7684\u8fb9\u9645\u4ef7\u503c\u4e0a\u5347"}}

This paper introduces AgriTrust, a federated semantic governance framework designed to resolve this paradox. AgriTrust integrates a multi-stakeholder governance model, built on pillars of Data Sovereignty, Transparent Data Contracts, Equitable Value Sharing, and Regulatory Compliance, with a semantic digital layer. This layer is realized through the AgriTrust Core Ontology, a formal OWL ontology that provides a shared vocabulary for tokenization, traceability, and certification, enabling true semantic interoperability across independent platforms. A key innovation is a blockchain-agnostic, multi-provider architecture that prevents vendor lock-in. The framework's viability is demonstrated through case studies across three critical Brazilian supply chains: coffee (for EUDR compliance), soy (for mass balance), and beef (for animal tracking). The results show that AgriTrust successfully enables verifiable provenance, automates compliance, and creates new revenue streams for data producers, thereby transforming data sharing from a trust-based dilemma into a governed, automated operation.

Since sub-synchronous control interactions (SSCI) arise from the mis-tuning of control gains under specific grid configurations, effective mitigation strategies require adaptive re-tuning of these gains. Such adaptiveness can be achieved by employing a closed-loop, learning-based framework that considers the grid conditions responsible for such sub-synchronous oscillations. This paper addresses this need by adopting methodologies inspired by Markov decision process (MDP) based reinforcement learning (RL), with a particular emphasis on simpler deep policy gradient methods with additional SSCI-specific signal processing modules such as down-sampling, bandpass filtering, and oscillation energy dependent reward computations. Our experimentation in a real-world event setting demonstrates that the deep policy gradient based trained policy can adaptively compute gain settings in response to varying grid conditions and optimally suppress control interaction-induced oscillations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u53ef\u8c03\u63a7\u5236\u589e\u76ca\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528EMT\u5728\u73af\u4eff\u771f\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u6b21\u540c\u6b65\u632f\u8361\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u6574\u63a7\u5236\u589e\u76ca\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236\u7531\u63a7\u5236\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u6b21\u540c\u6b65\u632f\u8361\u3002", "motivation": "\u6b21\u540c\u6b65\u63a7\u5236\u4ea4\u4e92(SSCI)\u6e90\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u7535\u7f51\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u63a7\u5236\u589e\u76ca\u7684\u5931\u8c03\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91cd\u65b0\u8c03\u6574\u8fd9\u4e9b\u589e\u76ca\u6765\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u7535\u7f51\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u8003\u8651\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b(MDP)\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u6dfb\u52a0\u4e86SSCI\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u4e0b\u91c7\u6837\u3001\u5e26\u901a\u6ee4\u6ce2\u3001\u632f\u8361\u80fd\u91cf\u76f8\u5173\u5956\u52b1\u8ba1\u7b97\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u591f\u6839\u636e\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u7535\u7f51\u6761\u4ef6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8ba1\u7b97\u589e\u76ca\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u5e76\u6700\u4f18\u5730\u6291\u5236\u63a7\u5236\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u632f\u8361\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u6b21\u540c\u6b65\u632f\u8361\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u589e\u76ca\u8c03\u6574\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u632f\u8361\u6291\u5236\u3002"}}

Anchoring bias, a classic human judgment bias, offers a critical test case. While prior work shows LLMs exhibit anchoring, most evidence relies on surface-level outputs, leaving internal mechanisms and attributional contributions unexplored. This paper advances the study of anchoring in LLMs through three contributions: (1) a log-probability-based behavioral analysis showing that anchors shift entire output distributions, with controls for training-data contamination; (2) exact Shapley-value attribution over structured prompt fields to quantify anchor influence on model log-probabilities; and (3) a unified Anchoring Bias Sensitivity Score integrating behavioral and attributional evidence across six open-source models. Results reveal robust anchoring effects in Gemma-2B, Phi-2, and Llama-2-7B, with attribution signaling that the anchors influence reweighting. Smaller models such as GPT-2, Falcon-RW-1B, and GPT-Neo-125M show variability, suggesting scale may modulate sensitivity. Attributional effects, however, vary across prompt designs, underscoring fragility in treating LLMs as human substitutes. The findings demonstrate that anchoring bias in LLMs is robust, measurable, and interpretable, while highlighting risks in applied domains. More broadly, the framework bridges behavioral science, LLM safety, and interpretability, offering a reproducible path for evaluating other cognitive biases in LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u6982\u7387\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5f52\u56e0\u65b9\u6cd5\u7814\u7a76LLMs\u4e2d\u7684\u951a\u5b9a\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u951a\u70b9\u4f1a\u6539\u53d8\u6574\u4e2a\u8f93\u51fa\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5e76\u5728Gemma-2B\u3001Phi-2\u548cLlama-2-7B\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u951a\u5b9a\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u800c\u8f83\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4e00\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8LLMs\u7684\u8868\u9762\u8f93\u51fa\u662f\u5426\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u951a\u5b9a\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5176\u5185\u90e8\u673a\u5236\u548c\u5f52\u56e0\u8d21\u732e\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u4e25\u8c28\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u533a\u5206\u8868\u9762\u6a21\u4eff\u548c\u6df1\u5c42\u6982\u7387\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6570\u6982\u7387\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u5206\u6790\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u5b57\u6bb5\u7684\u7cbe\u786eShapley\u503c\u5f52\u56e0\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6574\u5408\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u5f52\u56e0\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u951a\u5b9a\u504f\u5dee\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728Gemma-2B\u3001Phi-2\u548cLlama-2-7B\u4e2d\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u951a\u5b9a\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u951a\u70b9\u5f71\u54cd\u91cd\u65b0\u52a0\u6743\uff1b\u8f83\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u5982GPT-2\u3001Falcon-RW-1B\u548cGPT-Neo-125M\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4e00\uff1b\u5f52\u56e0\u6548\u679c\u56e0\u63d0\u793a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u800c\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMs\u4e2d\u7684\u951a\u5b9a\u504f\u5dee\u662f\u7a33\u5065\u3001\u53ef\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u5f52\u56e0\u6548\u679c\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u51f8\u663e\u4e86\u5c06LLMs\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4eba\u7c7b\u66ff\u4ee3\u54c1\u7684\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u4ed6\u8ba4\u77e5\u504f\u5dee\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

AOD is usually retrieved from satellite imagery at coarse spatial and temporal resolutions. However, producing high-resolution AOD estimates in both space and time can better support evidence-based policies and interventions. We propose a spatio-temporal disaggregation model that assumes a latent spatio--temporal continuous Gaussian process observed through aggregated measurements. The model links discrete observations to the continuous domain and accommodates covariates to improve explanatory power and interpretability. The approach employs Gaussian processes with separable or non-separable covariance structures derived from a diffusion-based spatio-temporal stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE). Bayesian inference is conducted using the INLA-SPDE framework for computational efficiency. Simulation studies and an application to nowcasting AOD at 550 nm in India demonstrate the model's effectiveness, improving spatial resolution from 0.75\u00b0 to 0.25\u00b0 and temporal resolution from 3 hours to 1 hour.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65f6\u7a7a\u5206\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u548cSPDE\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u7c97\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u6c14\u6eb6\u80f6\u5149\u5b66\u539a\u5ea6\u89c2\u6d4b\u5206\u89e3\u5230\u66f4\u9ad8\u65f6\u7a7a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387", "motivation": "\u6c14\u6eb6\u80f6\u5149\u5b66\u539a\u5ea6\u662f\u8861\u91cf\u7a7a\u6c14\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u536b\u661f\u89c2\u6d4b\u65f6\u7a7a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8f83\u4f4e\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4f30\u8ba1\u6765\u652f\u6301\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6f5c\u5728\u65f6\u7a7a\u8fde\u7eed\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u6216\u4e0d\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u91c7\u7528INLA-SPDE\u6846\u67b6\u8fdb\u884c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u65ad", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u5c06\u5370\u5ea6\u5730\u533aAOD\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4ece0.75\u00b0\u63d0\u5347\u52300.25\u00b0\uff0c\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4ece3\u5c0f\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u52301\u5c0f\u65f6", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u6c14\u6eb6\u80f6\u5149\u5b66\u539a\u5ea6\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u73af\u5883\u653f\u7b56\u548c\u516c\u5171\u536b\u751f\u5e72\u9884\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u6570\u636e\u652f\u6301"}}

Mapping Coverage and Gaps in First and Third Party Evaluations", "comment": null, "summary": "Foundation models are increasingly central to high-stakes AI systems, and governance frameworks now depend on evaluations to assess their risks and capabilities. Although general capability evaluations are widespread, social impact assessments covering bias, fairness, privacy, environmental costs, and labor practices remain uneven across the AI ecosystem. To characterize this landscape, we conduct the first comprehensive analysis of both first-party and third-party social impact evaluation reporting across a wide range of model developers. Our study examines 186 first-party release reports and 183 post-release evaluation sources, and complements this quantitative analysis with interviews of model developers. We find a clear division of evaluation labor: first-party reporting is sparse, often superficial, and has declined over time in key areas such as environmental impact and bias, while third-party evaluators including academic researchers, nonprofits, and independent organizations provide broader and more rigorous coverage of bias, harmful content, and performance disparities. However, this complementarity has limits. Only model developers can authoritatively report on data provenance, content moderation labor, financial costs, and training infrastructure, yet interviews reveal that these disclosures are often deprioritized unless tied to product adoption or regulatory compliance. Our findings indicate that current evaluation practices leave major gaps in assessing AI's societal impacts, highlighting the urgent need for policies that promote developer transparency, strengthen independent evaluation ecosystems, and create shared infrastructure to aggregate and compare third-party evaluations in a consistent and accessible way.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u5168\u9762\u5206\u6790\u4e86AI\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u8bc4\u4f30\u62a5\u544a\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7b2c\u4e00\u65b9\u62a5\u544a\u7a00\u758f\u4e14\u80a4\u6d45\uff0c\u800c\u7b2c\u4e09\u65b9\u8bc4\u4f30\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u4e25\u8c28\uff0c\u4f46\u5f53\u524d\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b9e\u8df5\u5b58\u5728\u91cd\u5927\u7f3a\u53e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u65e5\u76ca\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u793e\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u8bc4\u4f30\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u504f\u89c1\u3001\u516c\u5e73\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u3001\u73af\u5883\u6210\u672c\u548c\u52b3\u52a8\u5b9e\u8df5\uff09\u5728\u6574\u4e2aAI\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4ecd\u7136\u4e0d\u5747\u8861\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u4e86186\u4efd\u7b2c\u4e00\u65b9\u53d1\u5e03\u62a5\u544a\u548c183\u4efd\u53d1\u5e03\u540e\u8bc4\u4f30\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u5e76\u8f85\u4ee5\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u7684\u8bbf\u8c08\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u4f5c\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u5206\u5de5\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u65b9\u62a5\u544a\u7a00\u758f\u4e14\u80a4\u6d45\uff0c\u5728\u73af\u5883\u5f71\u54cd\u548c\u504f\u89c1\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u9886\u57df\u6709\u6240\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e09\u65b9\u8bc4\u4f30\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u548c\u4e25\u8c28\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u3001\u6709\u5bb3\u5185\u5bb9\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b9e\u8df5\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30AI\u793e\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u91cd\u5927\u7f3a\u53e3\uff0c\u8feb\u5207\u9700\u8981\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u3001\u52a0\u5f3a\u72ec\u7acb\u8bc4\u4f30\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u521b\u5efa\u5171\u4eab\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u7684\u653f\u7b56\u3002"}}

Addressing it requires evidence-based policies and a nuanced understanding of how the threat is perceived by the public, particularly within visual social media, where narratives quickly evolve through voices of individuals, politicians, NGOs, and institutions. This study investigates climate-related discourse on YouTube within the Brazilian context, a geopolitically significant nation in global environmental negotiations. Through three case studies, we examine (1) which psychological content traits most effectively drive audience engagement, (2) the extent to which these traits influence content popularity, and (3) whether such insights can inform the design of persuasive synthetic campaigns--such as climate denialism--using recent generative language models. Another contribution of this work is the release of a large publicly available dataset of 226K Brazilian YouTube videos and 2.7M user comments on climate change. The dataset includes fine-grained annotations of persuasive strategies, theory-of-mind categorizations in user responses, and typologies of content creators.

It demonstrates that regression models with fixed or time-varying parameters can be estimated using the OLS and time-varying OLS methods, respectively, across a broad class of regressors and noise processes not covered by existing theory. The proposed setting facilitates the development of asymptotic theory and the estimation of robust standard errors. The robust confidence interval estimators accommodate substantial heterogeneity in both regressors and noise. The resulting robust standard error estimates coincide with White's (1980) heteroskedasticity-consistent estimator but are applicable to a broader range of conditions, including models with missing data. They are computationally simple and perform well in Monte Carlo simulations. Their robustness, generality, and ease of implementation make them highly suitable for empirical applications.

System robustness is demonstrated through experiments involving unmodeled environmental challenges, including a vertical drop, an incline, and granular media, culminating in an outdoor field demonstration. To validate reproducibility, experiments were conducted using robot instances at two different laboratories. This work provides the robotics community with a complete navigation system for a compliant, impact-resistant, and shape-morphing robot. This system is intended to serve as a springboard for advancing the navigation capabilities of other unconventional robotic platforms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u5f00\u6e903\u6746\u5f20\u62c9\u6574\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5bfc\u822a\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u786c\u4ef6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5806\u6808\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u5df2\u77e5\u969c\u788d\u7269\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u907f\u969c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f20\u62c9\u6574\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5177\u6709\u6297\u51b2\u51fb\u3001\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5730\u5f62\u7684\u4f18\u70b9\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u590d\u6742\u7684\u8026\u5408\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7ed9\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u907f\u969c\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\uff1a(i)\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u5f00\u6e90\u786c\u4ef6\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff1b(ii)\u96c6\u6210\u5f00\u6e90\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5806\u6808\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u7269\u7406\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fa8\u8bc6\u3001\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u3001\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u8ddf\u8e2a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4f4d\u59ff\u5e76\u6267\u884c\u65e0\u78b0\u649e\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u5728\u672a\u5efa\u6a21\u73af\u5883\u6311\u6218\uff08\u5982\u5782\u76f4\u8dcc\u843d\u3001\u659c\u5761\u548c\u9897\u7c92\u4ecb\u8d28\uff09\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u53ef\u91cd\u73b0\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u793e\u533a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u67d4\u6027\u3001\u6297\u51b2\u51fb\u3001\u5f62\u72b6\u53ef\u53d8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u5bfc\u822a\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u63a8\u8fdb\u5176\u4ed6\u975e\u5e38\u89c4\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5e73\u53f0\u5bfc\u822a\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u8df3\u677f\u3002"}}

Advances in technology make them increasingly difficult to detect until they are close to the target and highly resistant to jamming. The evasion maneuver is the last line of defense for an aircraft. However, conventional rule-based evasion strategies are limited by computational demands and aerodynamic constraints, and existing learning-based approaches remain unconvincing for manned aircraft against modern missiles. To enhance aircraft survivability, this study investigates missile evasion inspired by the pursuit-evasion game between a gazelle and a cheetah and proposes a multi-stage reinforcement learning-based evasion strategy. The strategy learns a large azimuth policy to turn to evade, a small azimuth policy to keep moving away, and a short distance policy to perform agile aggressive maneuvers to avoid. One of the three policies is activated at each stage based on distance and azimuth. To evaluate performance, a high-fidelity simulation environment modeling an F-16 aircraft and missile under various conditions is used to compare the proposed approach with baseline strategies. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves superior performance, enabling the F-16 aircraft to successfully avoid missiles with a probability of 80.89 percent for velocities ranging from 800 m/s to 1400 m/s, maximum overloads from 40 g to 50 g, detection distances from 5000 m to 15000 m, and random azimuths. When the missile is detected beyond 8000 m, the success ratio increases to 85.06 percent.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5bfc\u5f39\u89c4\u907f\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6a21\u4eff\u730e\u8c79\u4e0e\u7f9a\u7f8a\u7684\u8ffd\u9003\u535a\u5f08\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8ddd\u79bb\u548c\u65b9\u4f4d\u9636\u6bb5\u91c7\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u907f\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728F-16\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u4eff\u771f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b080.89%\u7684\u89c4\u907f\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u5bfc\u5f39\u5bf9\u98de\u673a\u6784\u6210\u4e25\u91cd\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u89c4\u907f\u7b56\u7565\u53d7\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u548c\u6c14\u52a8\u7ea6\u675f\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6709\u4eba\u9a7e\u9a76\u98de\u673a\u5bf9\u6297\u73b0\u4ee3\u5bfc\u5f39\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u63d0\u5347\u98de\u673a\u751f\u5b58\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u5927\u65b9\u4f4d\u89d2\u8f6c\u5411\u89c4\u907f\u3001\u5c0f\u65b9\u4f4d\u89d2\u4fdd\u6301\u8fdc\u79bb\u3001\u77ed\u8ddd\u79bb\u654f\u6377\u673a\u52a8\u4e09\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u8ddd\u79bb\u548c\u65b9\u4f4d\u89d2\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u9636\u6bb5\u6fc0\u6d3b\u76f8\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728F-16\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u4eff\u771f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u901f\u5ea6800-1400m/s\u3001\u6700\u5927\u8fc7\u8f7d40-50g\u3001\u63a2\u6d4b\u8ddd\u79bb5000-15000m\u3001\u968f\u673a\u65b9\u4f4d\u89d2\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b080.89%\u7684\u5bfc\u5f39\u89c4\u907f\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff1b\u5f53\u63a2\u6d4b\u8ddd\u79bb\u8d85\u8fc78000m\u65f6\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u81f385.06%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5bfc\u5f39\u89c4\u907f\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u98de\u673a\u751f\u5b58\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5bf9\u6297\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u6709\u4eba\u9a7e\u9a76\u98de\u673a\u5bf9\u6297\u73b0\u4ee3\u5bfc\u5f39\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

These features, combined with regulatory priors from eQTL analysis, power a neural classifier that achieves high predictive performance in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) detection (88.0\\% accuracy). To support human understanding and trust, we introduce an LLM-based reasoning module that translates model outputs into audience-specific diagnostic reports, grounded in clinical features, attribution signals, and domain knowledge.

Grounded in socio-technical systems (STS) theory, this mixed-methods study audits workforce preparedness across Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain, and Oman. We combine term frequency--inverse document frequency (TF--IDF) analysis of six national AI strategies (NASs), an inventory of 47 publicly disclosed AI initiatives (January 2017--April 2025), paired case studies, the Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI) and the Saudi Data & Artificial Intelligence Authority (SDAIA) Academy, and a scenario matrix linking oil-revenue slack (technical capacity) to regulatory coherence (social alignment). Across the corpus, 34/47 initiatives (0.72; 95% Wilson CI 0.58--0.83) exhibit joint social--technical design; country-level indices span 0.57--0.90 (small n; intervals overlap). Scenario results suggest that, under our modeled conditions, regulatory convergence plausibly binds outcomes more than fiscal capacity: fragmented rules can offset high oil revenues, while harmonized standards help preserve progress under austerity. We also identify an emerging two-track talent system, research elites versus rapidly trained practitioners, that risks labor-market bifurcation without bridging mechanisms.

However, these advances come with significant risks: rapid AI development can undermine human agency, exacerbate inequities, and outpace our capacity to guide its use with sound policy. Human learning presupposes cognitive efforts and social interaction (dialogues). In response to this evolving landscape, an international workshop titled \"Educational Dialogue: Moving Thinking Forward\" convened 19 leading researchers from 11 countries in Cambridge (September 1-3, 2025) to examine the intersection of AI and educational dialogue. This AI-focused strand of the workshop centered on three critical questions: (1) When is AI truly useful in education, and when might it merely replace human effort at the expense of learning? (2) Under what conditions can AI use lead to better dialogic teaching and learning? (3) Does the AI-human partnership risk outpacing and displacing human educational work, and what are the implications?

Building on the recent HyperEF framework, our approach offers three primary contributions. Specifically, first, by leveraging the expanded Krylov subspace exploiting both clique and star expansions of hyperedges, we can significantly improve the approximation accuracy of effective resistances. Second, we propose a resistance-based local clustering scheme for merging small isolated nodes into nearby clusters, yielding more balanced clusters with substantially improved conductance. Third, the proposed HyperEF 2.0 enables the integration of resistance-based hyperedge weighting and community detection into a multilevel hypergraph partitioning tool, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Extensive experiments on real-world VLSI benchmarks show that HyperEF 2.0 can more effectively coarsen hypergraphs without compromising their structural properties, while delivering much better solution quality (e.g. conductance) than the state-of-the-art hypergraph coarsening methods, such as HyperEF and HyperSF.

We focus on the problem of synthesizing grasps for multi-finger robot hands that, given a target object's geometry and pose, computes a hand configuration. Existing approaches often struggle to produce reliable grasps that sufficiently constrain object motion, leading to instability under disturbances and failed grasps. A key reason is that during grasp generation, they typically focus on resisting a single wrench, while ignoring the object's potential for adversarial movements, such as escaping. We propose a new grasp-synthesis approach that explicitly captures and leverages the adversarial object motion in grasp generation by formulating the problem as a two-player game. One player controls the robot to generate feasible grasp configurations, while the other adversarially controls the object to seek motions that attempt to escape from the grasp. Simulation experiments on various robot platforms and target objects show that our approach achieves a success rate of 75.78%, up to 19.61% higher than the state-of-the-art baseline. The two-player game mechanism improves the grasping success rate by 27.40% over the method without the game formulation. Our approach requires only 0.28-1.04 seconds on average to generate a grasp configuration, depending on the robot platform, making it suitable for real-world deployment. In real-world experiments, our approach achieves an average success rate of 85.0% on ShadowHand and 87.5% on LeapHand, which confirms its feasibility and effectiveness in real robot setups.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u53cc\u73a9\u5bb6\u535a\u5f08\u7684\u591a\u6307\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6293\u53d6\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u7269\u4f53\u8fd0\u52a8\u6765\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6293\u53d6\u914d\u7f6e\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u751f\u6210\u6293\u53d6\u65f6\u901a\u5e38\u53ea\u5173\u6ce8\u62b5\u6297\u5355\u4e00\u529b\u77e9\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u7269\u4f53\u53ef\u80fd\u9003\u8131\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6293\u53d6\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u5931\u8d25\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6293\u53d6\u5408\u6210\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u53cc\u73a9\u5bb6\u535a\u5f08\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u73a9\u5bb6\u63a7\u5236\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u884c\u6293\u53d6\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u73a9\u5bb6\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u5730\u63a7\u5236\u7269\u4f53\u5bfb\u627e\u9003\u8131\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u62df\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u6210\u529f\u738775.78%\uff0c\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u9ad819.61%\uff1b\u771f\u5b9e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2dShadowHand\u6210\u529f\u738785.0%\uff0cLeapHand\u6210\u529f\u738787.5%\uff1b\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u4ec5\u97000.28-1.04\u79d2\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53cc\u73a9\u5bb6\u535a\u5f08\u673a\u5236\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6293\u53d6\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

Dynamic Learning and Proactive Correction for Hallucination Detection", "comment": null, "summary": "Hallucination in large language models (LLMs) remains a critical barrier to their safe deployment. Existing tool-augmented hallucination detection methods require pre-defined fixed verification strategies, which are crucial to the quality and effectiveness of tool calls. Some methods directly employ powerful closed-source LLMs such as GPT-4 as detectors, which are effective but too costly. To mitigate the cost issue, some methods adopt the teacher-student architecture and finetune open-source small models as detectors via agent tuning. However, these methods are limited by fixed strategies. When faced with a dynamically changing execution environment, they may lack adaptability and inappropriately call tools, ultimately leading to detection failure. To address the problem of insufficient strategy adaptability, we propose the innovative ``Learning to Evaluate and Adaptively Plan''(LEAP) framework, which endows an efficient student model with the dynamic learning and proactive correction capabilities of the teacher model. Specifically, our method formulates the hallucination detection problem as a dynamic strategy learning problem. We first employ a teacher model to generate trajectories within the dynamic learning loop and dynamically adjust the strategy based on execution failures. We then distill this dynamic planning capability into an efficient student model via agent tuning. Finally, during strategy execution, the student model adopts a proactive correction mechanism, enabling it to propose, review, and optimize its own verification strategies before execution.

People face high fees, complex legal language, a shortage of lawyers, and millions of unresolved court cases. Generative AI models like OpenAI GPT-4.1 Mini, Gemini 2.0 Flash, Meta Llama 3 70B, and DeepSeek R1 could potentially democratize legal assistance by providing quick and affordable legal advice. In this study, we collected 250 authentic legal questions from the Facebook group \"Know Your Rights,\" where verified legal experts regularly provide authoritative answers. These questions were subsequently submitted to four four advanced AI models and responses were generated using a consistent, standardized prompt. A comprehensive dual evaluation framework was employed, in which a state-of-the-art LLM model served as a judge, assessing each AI-generated response across four critical dimensions: factual accuracy, legal appropriateness, completeness, and clarity. Following this, the same set of questions was evaluated by three licensed Bangladeshi legal professionals according to the same criteria. In addition, automated evaluation metrics, including BLEU scores, were applied to assess response similarity. Our findings reveal a complex landscape where AI models frequently generate high-quality, well-structured legal responses but also produce dangerous misinformation, including fabricated case citations, incorrect legal procedures, and potentially harmful advice. These results underscore the critical need for rigorous expert validation and comprehensive safeguards before AI systems can be safely deployed for legal consultation in Bangladesh.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u56db\u79cdAI\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b5f\u52a0\u62c9\u56fd\u6cd5\u5f8b\u54a8\u8be2\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u867d\u7136AI\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u56de\u7b54\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u5b58\u5728\u5371\u9669\u9519\u8bef\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u5bb6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u624d\u80fd\u5b89\u5168\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b5f\u52a0\u62c9\u56fd\u6cd5\u5f8b\u670d\u52a1\u9762\u4e34\u9ad8\u8d39\u7528\u3001\u590d\u6742\u6cd5\u5f8b\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u5f8b\u5e08\u77ed\u7f3a\u548c\u6848\u4ef6\u79ef\u538b\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u901a\u8fc7AI\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u5feb\u901f\u5ec9\u4ef7\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u63f4\u52a9\u6765\u6c11\u4e3b\u5316\u6cd5\u5f8b\u670d\u52a1\u3002", "method": "\u6536\u96c6250\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6cd5\u5f8b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u56db\u79cd\u5148\u8fdbAI\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u56de\u7b54\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u91cd\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u7531\u6700\u5148\u8fdbLLM\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4e09\u540d\u6301\u724c\u5b5f\u52a0\u62c9\u56fd\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4e13\u4e1a\u4eba\u58eb\u6309\u7167\u4e8b\u5b9e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u6cd5\u5f8b\u9002\u5f53\u6027\u3001\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u548c\u6e05\u6670\u5ea6\u56db\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "AI\u6a21\u578b\u7ecf\u5e38\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u56de\u7b54\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u4ea7\u751f\u5371\u9669\u9519\u8bef\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u634f\u9020\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\u5f15\u7528\u3001\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u7a0b\u5e8f\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u6709\u5bb3\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b89\u5168\u90e8\u7f72\u7528\u4e8e\u5b5f\u52a0\u62c9\u56fd\u6cd5\u5f8b\u54a8\u8be2\u4e4b\u524d\uff0c\u8feb\u5207\u9700\u8981\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u5168\u9762\u4fdd\u969c\u63aa\u65bd\u3002"}}

Walker", "Jane Macfarlane"], "title": "Beyond Centrality: Understanding Urban Street Network Typologies Through Intersection Patterns", "comment": null, "summary": "The structure of road networks plays a pivotal role in shaping transportation dynamics. It also provides insights into how drivers experience city streets and helps uncover each urban environment's unique characteristics and challenges. Consequently, characterizing cities based on their road network patterns can facilitate the identification of similarities and differences, informing collaborative traffic management strategies, particularly at a regional scale. While previous studies have investigated global network patterns for cities, they have often overlooked detailed characterizations within a single large urban region. Additionally, most existing research uses metrics like degree, centrality, orientation, etc., and misses the nuances of street networks at the intersection level, specifically the geometric angles formed by links at intersections, which could offer a more refined feature for characterization. To address these gaps, this study examines over 100 cities in the San Francisco Bay Area. We introduce a novel metric for classifying intersections, distinguishing between different types of 3-way and 4-way intersections based on the angles formed at the intersections. Through the application of clustering algorithms in machine learning, we have identified three distinct typologies - grid, orthogonal, and organic cities - within the San Francisco Bay Area. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the metric in capturing the differences between cities based on street and intersection patterns. The typologies generated in this study could offer valuable support for city planners and policymakers in crafting a range of practical strategies tailored to the complexities of each city's road network, covering aspects such as evacuation plans, traffic signage placements, and traffic signal control.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ea4\u53c9\u53e3\u89d2\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u65b0\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5bf9\u65e7\u91d1\u5c71\u6e7e\u533a100\u591a\u4e2a\u57ce\u5e02\u8fdb\u884c\u9053\u8def\u7f51\u7edc\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u7f51\u683c\u72b6\u3001\u6b63\u4ea4\u72b6\u548c\u6709\u673a\u72b6\u4e09\u79cd\u57ce\u5e02\u7c7b\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5f80\u5f80\u5ffd\u89c6\u5355\u4e00\u5927\u578b\u57ce\u5e02\u533a\u57df\u5185\u7684\u8be6\u7ec6\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4e14\u5927\u591a\u4f7f\u7528\u5ea6\u3001\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6027\u7b49\u4f20\u7edf\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u4ea4\u53c9\u53e3\u5c42\u9762\u51e0\u4f55\u89d2\u5ea6\u7684\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u9053\u8def\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u7ec6\u5fae\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ea4\u53c9\u53e3\u89d2\u5ea6\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u5206\u7c7b\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u533a\u5206\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u76843\u8def\u548c4\u8def\u4ea4\u53c9\u53e3\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u805a\u7c7b\u7b97\u6cd5\u5bf9\u57ce\u5e02\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u65e7\u91d1\u5c71\u6e7e\u533a\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u4e09\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u57ce\u5e02\u7c7b\u578b\uff1a\u7f51\u683c\u72b6\u3001\u6b63\u4ea4\u72b6\u548c\u6709\u673a\u72b6\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b0\u6307\u6807\u5728\u6355\u6349\u57ce\u5e02\u8857\u9053\u548c\u4ea4\u53c9\u53e3\u6a21\u5f0f\u5dee\u5f02\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4e3a\u57ce\u5e02\u89c4\u5212\u8005\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u5236\u5b9a\u9488\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u9053\u8def\u7f51\u7edc\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5982\u758f\u6563\u8ba1\u5212\u3001\u4ea4\u901a\u6807\u5fd7\u8bbe\u7f6e\u548c\u4fe1\u53f7\u63a7\u5236\u7b49\u3002"}}

These models are demonstrated with three applications: 1) the effect of the introduction of the prostate specific antigen test on prostate cancer diagnosis rates by race and age group, 2) the change in stroke or trans-ischemic attack hospitalization rates across Medicare beneficiaries by rurality in the months after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and 3) the effect of Medicaid expansion in Missouri on the proportion of inpatient hospitalizations discharged with Medicaid as a primary payer by key age groupings and sex.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u5e7f\u4e49\u52a0\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u591a\u5c42\u6b21\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u4e2d\u65ad\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u533b\u7597\u5e94\u7528\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u4e2d\u65ad\u6548\u5e94\u3001\u591a\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u540e\u5206\u5c42\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u9f13\u52b1\u7b80\u7ea6\u6027\u3001\u90e8\u5206\u6c60\u5316\u5e76\u5305\u542b\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u56e0\u679c\u6548\u5e94\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u5e7f\u4e49\u52a0\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u591a\u5c42\u6b21\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u5206\u5c42\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u4e2d\u65ad\u6548\u5e94\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u540e\u5206\u5c42\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u533b\u7597\u5e94\u7528\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\u6210\u529f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff1aPSA\u68c0\u6d4b\u5bf9\u524d\u5217\u817a\u764c\u8bca\u65ad\u7387\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3001COVID-19\u5bf9\u5352\u4e2d\u4f4f\u9662\u7387\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u5bc6\u82cf\u91cc\u5dde\u533b\u7597\u8865\u52a9\u6269\u5c55\u5bf9\u652f\u4ed8\u65b9\u5f0f\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u591a\u5c42\u6b21\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u8868\u5f81\u4e2d\u65ad\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u9f13\u52b1\u7b80\u7ea6\u6027\u548c\u90e8\u5206\u6c60\u5316\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6355\u6349\u4e0d\u540c\u4e9a\u7fa4\u4f53\u95f4\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u6548\u5e94\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e2d\u65ad\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7075\u6d3b\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

In such robots, the primary role of a hand-eye camera is to accurately estimate 3D positions of graspable points (i.e., convex terrain surfaces) thanks to its close-up views. While conventional climbing robots often employ RGB-D cameras as hand-eye cameras to facilitate straightforward 3D terrain mapping and graspable point detection, RGB-D cameras are large and consume considerable power.\n  This work presents a 3D terrain mapping system designed for space exploration using limbed climbing robots equipped with a monocular hand-eye camera. Compared to RGB-D cameras, monocular cameras are more lightweight, compact structures, and have lower power consumption. Although monocular SLAM can be used to construct 3D maps, it suffers from scale ambiguity. To address this limitation, we propose a SLAM method that fuses monocular visual constraints with limb forward kinematics. The proposed method jointly estimates time-series gripper poses and the global metric scale of the 3D map based on factor graph optimization.\n  We validate the proposed framework through both physics-based simulations and real-world experiments. The results demonstrate that our framework constructs a metrically scaled 3D terrain map in real-time and enables autonomous grasping of convex terrain surfaces using a monocular hand-eye camera, without relying on RGB-D cameras. Our method contributes to scalable and energy-efficient perception for future space missions involving limbed climbing robots.

However, the quality of these reasoning chains remains underexplored. We present a comprehensive empirical study examining the reasoning process and quality of thinking LLMs for code generation. We evaluate six state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs (DeepSeek-R1, OpenAI-o3-mini, Claude-3.7-Sonnet-Thinking, Gemini-2.0-Flash-Thinking, Gemini-2.5-Flash, and Qwen-QwQ) across 100 code generation tasks of varying difficulty from BigCodeBench. We quantify reasoning-chain structure through step counts and verbosity, conduct controlled step-budget adjustments, and perform a 21-participant human evaluation across three dimensions: efficiency, logical correctness, and completeness. Our step-count interventions reveal that targeted step increases can improve resolution rates for certain models/tasks, while modest reductions often preserve success on standard tasks, rarely on hard ones. Through systematic analysis, we develop a reasoning-problematic taxonomy, identifying completeness as the dominant failure mode.

However, many leading Graph Neural Network (GNN) models often neglect the valuable semantic information aggregated at the class level. To address this limitation, this paper introduces CGLE (Class-label Graph Link Estimator), a novel framework designed to augment GNN-based link prediction models. CGLE operates by constructing a class-conditioned link probability matrix, where each entry represents the probability of a link forming between two node classes. This matrix is derived from either available ground-truth labels or from pseudo-labels obtained through clustering. The resulting class-based prior is then concatenated with the structural link embedding from a backbone GNN, and the combined representation is processed by a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for the final prediction. Crucially, CGLE's logic is encapsulated in an efficient preprocessing stage, leaving the computational complexity of the underlying GNN model unaffected. We validate our approach through extensive experiments on a broad suite of benchmark datasets, covering both homophilous and sparse heterophilous graphs. The results show that CGLE yields substantial performance gains over strong baselines such as NCN and NCNC, with improvements in HR@100 of over 10 percentage points on homophilous datasets like Pubmed and DBLP. On sparse heterophilous graphs, CGLE delivers an MRR improvement of over 4% on the Chameleon dataset.

This paper proposes a novel framework integrating hierarchical semantic decomposition, reinforcement learning (RL), visual language models (VLMs), and knowledge distillation to overcome these limitations. Complex tasks are decomposed into atomic skills, with RL-trained policies for each primitive exclusively in simulation. Crucially, our RL formulation incorporates explicit force constraints to prevent object damage during delicate interactions. VLMs perform high-level task decomposition and skill planning, generating diverse expert demonstrations. These are distilled into a unified policy via Visual-Tactile Diffusion Policy for end-to-end execution. We conduct comprehensive ablation studies exploring different VLM-based task planners to identify optimal demonstration generation pipelines, and systematically compare imitation learning algorithms for skill distillation. Extensive simulation experiments and physical deployment validate that our approach achieves policy learning for long-horizon manipulation without costly human demonstrations, while the VLM-guided atomic skill framework enables scalable generalization to diverse tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u5206\u5c42\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u89e3\u3001\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u4e3b\u6267\u884c\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u3001\u63a5\u89e6\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u6f14\u793a\u6570\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u548c\u4e13\u5bb6\u5de5\u7a0b\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u6210\u672c\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u514b\u670d\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u7c7b\u6f14\u793a\u7684\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u539f\u5b50\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6280\u80fd\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u52a0\u5165\u529b\u7ea6\u675f\u9632\u6b62\u7269\u4f53\u635f\u574f\u3002\u4f7f\u7528VLM\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u5c42\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u6280\u80fd\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u5316\u4e13\u5bb6\u6f14\u793a\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9-\u89e6\u89c9\u6269\u6563\u7b56\u7565\u84b8\u998f\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u9762\u7684\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u6f14\u793a\u751f\u6210\u6d41\u7a0b\u548c\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u7269\u7406\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5b66\u4e60\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4e14VLM\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u539f\u5b50\u6280\u80fd\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u591a\u6837\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u7c7b\u6f14\u793a\u7684\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\uff0cVLM\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u539f\u5b50\u6280\u80fd\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u901a\u7528\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

Platoon coordination is essential to smoothen the interaction between CAV platoons and non-CAV traffic. Based on a fluid queuing model, we develop a \"probe-and-release\" algorithm that simultaneously estimates environmental parameters and coordinates CAV platoons for traffic stabilization. We show that this algorithm ensures bounded estimation errors and bounded traffic queues. The proof builds on a Lyapunov function that jointly penalizes estimation errors and traffic queues and a drift argument for an embedded Markov process. We validate the proposed algorithm in a standard micro-simulation environment and compare against a representative deep reinforcement learning method in terms of control performance and computational efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\"\u63a2\u6d4b-\u91ca\u653e\"\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u534f\u8c03\u6df7\u5408\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u74f6\u9888\u5904\u7684CAV\u8f66\u961f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f30\u8ba1\u73af\u5883\u53c2\u6570\u5e76\u7a33\u5b9a\u4ea4\u901a\u6d41\u91cf\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u4ea4\u901a\u961f\u5217\u6709\u754c\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u6df7\u5408\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u74f6\u9888\u5904CAV\u8f66\u961f\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e94\u5bf9\u65f6\u53d8\u4ea4\u901a\u9700\u6c42\u3001\u968f\u673aCAV\u8f66\u961f\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u5bb9\u91cf\u5d29\u6e83\u4e09\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9645\u91cd\u8981\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5e73\u6ed1CAV\u8f66\u961f\u4e0e\u975eCAV\u4ea4\u901a\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u4f53\u6392\u961f\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u53d1\"\u63a2\u6d4b-\u91ca\u653e\"\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f30\u8ba1\u73af\u5883\u53c2\u6570\u5e76\u534f\u8c03CAV\u8f66\u961f\u8fdb\u884c\u4ea4\u901a\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002\u7b97\u6cd5\u6784\u5efa\u5728Lyapunov\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u5d4c\u5165\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u6f02\u79fb\u8bba\u8bc1\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u786e\u4fdd\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u4ea4\u901a\u961f\u5217\u6709\u754c\uff0c\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u5fae\u89c2\u4eff\u771f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u63a7\u5236\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\"\u63a2\u6d4b-\u91ca\u653e\"\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u534f\u8c03\u6df7\u5408\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u74f6\u9888\u5904\u7684CAV\u8f66\u961f\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4ea4\u901a\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ea4\u901a\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

While previous research has quantified bias at the dataset level or manually identified spurious correlations between modalities and labels, these approaches lack meaningful insights at the sample level and struggle to scale to the vast amount of online information. In this paper, we investigate the design for automated recognition of modality bias at the sample level. Specifically, we propose three bias quantification methods based on theories/views of different levels of granularity: 1) a coarse-grained evaluation of modality benefit; 2) a medium-grained quantification of information flow; and 3) a fine-grained causality analysis. To verify the effectiveness, we conduct a human evaluation on two popular benchmarks. Experimental results reveal three interesting findings that provide potential direction toward future research: 1)~Ensembling multiple views is crucial for reliable automated analysis; 2)~Automated analysis is prone to detector-induced fluctuations; and 3)~Different views produce a higher agreement on modality-balanced samples but diverge on biased ones.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u7c92\u5ea6\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u504f\u89c1\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u6837\u672c\u5c42\u9762\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u9519\u8bef\u4fe1\u606f\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u504f\u89c1\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u9519\u8bef\u4fe1\u606f\u57fa\u51c6\u5b58\u5728\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u4f7f\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u6001\u5c31\u80fd\u505a\u51fa\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5c42\u9762\u91cf\u5316\u504f\u89c1\u6216\u624b\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u6001\u4e0e\u6807\u7b7e\u95f4\u7684\u4f2a\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6837\u672c\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u6d77\u91cf\u5728\u7ebf\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u6548\u76ca\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1b2\uff09\u4e2d\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u91cf\u5316\uff1b3\uff09\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u5206\u6790\u3002\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u6d41\u884c\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u4f30\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a1\uff09\u96c6\u6210\u591a\u4e2a\u89c6\u89d2\u5bf9\u53ef\u9760\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u6790\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff1b2\uff09\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u6790\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u6ce2\u52a8\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b3\uff09\u4e0d\u540c\u89c6\u89d2\u5728\u6a21\u6001\u5e73\u8861\u6837\u672c\u4e0a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u5728\u504f\u89c1\u6837\u672c\u4e0a\u5206\u6b67\u66f4\u5927\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u9519\u8bef\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6f5c\u5728\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u96c6\u6210\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u5206\u6790\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

Previous epidemiological research has focused on MRSA transmission, but few studies have examined the influence of both hospital-acquired MRSA (HA-MRSA) and community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) on MRSA spread in hospitals. In this study, we present a unique compartmental model for studying MRSA transmission patterns in hospitals in Edmonton, Alberta. The model consists of susceptible individuals, patients who have been colonized or infected with HA-MRSA or CA-MRSA, and isolated patients.

For stability analysis and control-related problems, it is desired that the defining RKHS of the Koopman operator should account for both the stability of an equilibrium point (as a local property) and the regularity of the dynamics on the state space (as a global property). To this end, we show that by using the product kernel formed by the linear kernel and a Wendland radial kernel, the resulting RKHS is invariant under the action of Koopman operator (under certain smoothness conditions). Furthermore, when the equilibrium is asymptotically stable, the spectrum of Koopman operator is provably confined inside the unit circle, and escapes therefrom upon bifurcation. Thus, the learned Koopman operator with provable probabilistic error bound provides a stability certificate.

However, most existing LLM agents typically operate within static execution frameworks, lacking a principled mechanism to learn and self-improve from their own experience and past rollouts. As a result, their performance remains bounded by the initial framework design and the underlying LLM's capabilities. We propose Self-Abstraction from Grounded Experience (SAGE), a framework that enables agents to learn from their own task executions and refine their behavior through self-abstraction. After an initial rollout, the agent induces a concise plan abstraction from its grounded experience, distilling key steps, dependencies, and constraints. This learned abstraction is then fed back as contextual guidance, refining the agent's policy and supporting more structured, informed subsequent executions. Empirically, SAGE delivers consistent performance gains across diverse LLM backbones and agent architectures. Notably, it yields a 7.2% relative performance improvement over the strong Mini-SWE-Agent baseline when paired with the GPT-5 (high) backbone.

With the rise of generative AI (GenAI), students even at the introductory level are able to generate large quantities of code, and it is becoming increasingly important to equip them with the ability to decompose problems. There is not yet a consensus among educators on how to best teach and assess the skill of decomposition, particularly in introductory computing. This practitioner paper details the development of questions to assess the skill of problem decomposition, and impressions about how these questions were received by students. A challenge unique to problem decomposition questions is their necessarily lengthy context, and we detail our approach to addressing this problem using Question Suites: scaffolded sequences of questions that help students understand a question's context before attempting to decompose it. We then describe the use of open-ended drawing of decomposition diagrams as another form of assessment. We outline the learning objectives used to design our questions and describe how we addressed challenges encountered in early iterations.

At the top layer, a centralized allocation module assigns control authority (i.e., selects a single vehicle to execute its trajectory) by maximizing a utility that accounts for waiting time, urgency, control history, and velocity deviation. At the bottom layer, the authorized vehicle executes a precomputed trajectory using a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) and applies a high-order Control Barrier Function (HOCBF)-based safety filter for real-time collision avoidance. Simulation results across varying traffic demands and demand distributions demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves near-perfect fairness, eliminates collisions, reduces average delay, and maintains real-time feasibility.

The cantilevered beam under harmonic excitation is modeled using a lumped parameter approach. Based on retrospective cost optimization, a sampled-data adaptive controller is developed to suppress vibrations caused by external disturbances.

We show that religious stakeholders find non-neutral secular embeddings in technologies and the firms and people that design them, and how these manifest in unintended harms for religious and nonreligious users. Our findings reveal how users navigate technoreligious practices with religiously informed mental models and what they desire from technologies.

We propose a modular framework for language-conditioned safety in robot navigation.

Drawing inspiration from the classical Unit Commitment Problem (UCP), we first design a linear model to determine the optimal power generation mix over a 24-hour horizon, using real-world data from Vietnam, a country with a highly carbon intensive energy system. This allows us to estimate time-varying CO2 emissions and translate them into an emission cost signal. We then incorporate this environmental cost into a smart charging optimization model, formulated as a linear program (LP). Numerical simulations confirm that the proposed strategy significantly outperforms a baseline First-In-First-Served (FIFS) approach, achieving notable reductions in both CO2 emissions and charging costs also compared to another optimization approach. The results demonstrate the potential of this multiobjective optimization framework to support more sustainable and cost-efficient EV charging strategies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e09\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u7535\u52a8\u6c7d\u8f66\u5145\u7535\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5145\u7535\u6210\u672c\u548c\u4e8c\u6c27\u5316\u78b3\u6392\u653e\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d8a\u5357\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u6392\u653e\u548c\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u7535\u52a8\u6c7d\u8f66\u5145\u7535\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6210\u672c\u548c\u73af\u5883\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9ad8\u78b3\u5f3a\u5ea6\u80fd\u6e90\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u56fd\u5bb6\u3002", "method": "\u4e09\u6b65\u9aa4\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u57fa\u4e8e\u5355\u4f4d\u627f\u8bfa\u95ee\u9898\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u786e\u5b9a24\u5c0f\u65f6\u6700\u4f18\u53d1\u7535\u7ec4\u5408\uff1b2) \u4f30\u7b97\u65f6\u53d8CO2\u6392\u653e\u5e76\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u6392\u653e\u6210\u672c\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1b3) \u5c06\u73af\u5883\u6210\u672c\u7eb3\u5165\u667a\u80fd\u5145\u7535\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u5148\u5230\u5148\u670d\u52a1\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86CO2\u6392\u653e\u548c\u5145\u7535\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4e5f\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u652f\u6301\u66f4\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u548c\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u7535\u52a8\u6c7d\u8f66\u5145\u7535\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

The back-four defensive line plays a decisive role in preventing goal-scoring opportunities, yet its collective coordination remains difficult to quantify. This study introduces interpretable spatio-temporal indicators namely, space control, stretch index, pressure index, and defensive line height (absolute and relative) to evaluate the effectiveness of the back-four during defensive transitions. Using synchronized tracking and event data from the 2023-24 LaLiga season, 2,413 defensive sequences were analyzed following possession losses by FC Barcelona and Real Madrid CF. Two-way ANOVA revealed significant effects of team, outcome, and their interaction for key indicators, with relative line height showing the strongest association with defensive success. Predictive modeling using XGBoost achieved the highest discriminative performance (ROC AUC: 0.724 for Barcelona, 0.698 for Real Madrid), identifying space score and relative line height as dominant predictors. Comparative analysis revealed distinct team-specific defensive behaviors: Barcelona's success was characterized by higher spatial control and compact line coordination, whereas Real Madrid exhibited more adaptive but less consistent defensive structures. These findings demonstrate the tactical and predictive value of interpretable spatial indicators for quantifying collective defensive performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u6307\u6807\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u8db3\u7403\u9632\u5b88\u8f6c\u6362\u4e2d\u540e\u56db\u540e\u536b\u7ebf\u7684\u96c6\u4f53\u534f\u8c03\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u897f\u75322023-24\u8d5b\u5b63\u6570\u636e\u53d1\u73b0\u76f8\u5bf9\u9632\u7ebf\u9ad8\u5ea6\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a7\u5236\u662f\u9632\u5b88\u6210\u529f\u7684\u5173\u952e\u9884\u6d4b\u56e0\u5b50\uff0c\u5df4\u585e\u7f57\u90a3\u548c\u7687\u5bb6\u9a6c\u5fb7\u91cc\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u9632\u5b88\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u8db3\u7403\u9632\u5b88\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5728\u8d1f\u9762\u8f6c\u6362\u65f6\u6700\u4e3a\u8106\u5f31\uff0c\u540e\u56db\u540e\u536b\u7ebf\u7684\u96c6\u4f53\u534f\u8c03\u5bf9\u9632\u6b62\u8fdb\u7403\u673a\u4f1a\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u76ee\u524d\u96be\u4ee5\u91cf\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u540c\u6b65\u8ffd\u8e2a\u548c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6570\u636e\u5206\u67902413\u4e2a\u9632\u5b88\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a7\u5236\u3001\u62c9\u4f38\u6307\u6570\u3001\u538b\u529b\u6307\u6570\u548c\u9632\u7ebf\u9ad8\u5ea6\u7b49\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u5411ANOVA\u548cXGBoost\u9884\u6d4b\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u5bf9\u9632\u7ebf\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e0e\u9632\u5b88\u6210\u529f\u5173\u8054\u6700\u5f3a\uff0cXGBoost\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5df4\u585e\u7f57\u90a3\u548c\u7687\u5bb6\u9a6c\u5fb7\u91cc\u7684ROC AUC\u5206\u522b\u8fbe\u52300.724\u548c0.698\uff0c\u5df4\u585e\u7f57\u90a3\u4f9d\u8d56\u9ad8\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u7d27\u51d1\u9632\u7ebf\uff0c\u7687\u9a6c\u9632\u5b88\u7ed3\u6784\u66f4\u9002\u5e94\u4f46\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u6307\u6807\u5177\u6709\u6218\u672f\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u91cf\u5316\u96c6\u4f53\u9632\u5b88\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4e3a\u7403\u961f\u6218\u672f\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Existing approaches focus on single learning experiences and do not account for students' gradual knowledge construction and evolving skill sets. Moreover, large language models are optimized to produce direct and accurate responses, making it challenging to represent the incomplete understanding and developmental constraints that characterize real learners. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for memory-based student simulation that incorporates developmental trajectories through a hierarchical memory mechanism with structured knowledge representation. The framework also integrates metacognitive processes and personality traits to enrich the individual learner profiling, through dynamical consolidation of both cognitive development and personal learning characteristics.

Recently, the performances of ISAC were experimentally evaluated and demonstrated in various scenarios by developing ISAC systems. These systems generally consist of coherent transmitting (Tx) and receiving (Rx) modules. However, actively transmitting radio waves for experiments is not easy due to regulatory restrictions of radio. Meanwhile, the Tx/Rx should be synchronized and Rx need the information of Tx. In this paper, a fully passive mmWave sensing system is developed with software-defined radio for blind ISAC. It only consists of a passive Rx module which does not depend on the Tx. Since the proposed system is not synchronized with Tx and has no knowledge of the transmitted signals, a differential structure with two oppositely-oriented receivers is introduced to realize the sensing function. This structure can mitigate the influences of unknown source signals and other distortions. With the proposed sensing system, the ambient mmWave communication signals are leveraged for sensing without interrupting the existing systems. It can be deployed for field applications such as signal detection and dynamic human activity recognition since it does not emit signals. The efficacy of the developed system is first verified with a metallic plate with known motion pattern. The measured Doppler spectrogram shows good agreement with the simulation results, demonstrating the correctness of the sensing results. Further, the system is evaluated in complex scenarios, including handwaving, single- and multi-person motion detection. The sensing results successfully reflect the corresponding motions, demonstrating that the proposed sensing system can be utilized for blind ISAC in various applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b8c\u5168\u88ab\u52a8\u7684\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u611f\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u76f2\u96c6\u6210\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u88ab\u52a8\u63a5\u6536\u6a21\u5757\u800c\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u53d1\u5c04\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5dee\u5206\u7ed3\u6784\u6d88\u9664\u672a\u77e5\u4fe1\u53f7\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfISAC\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u8981\u4e3b\u52a8\u53d1\u5c04\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u6ce2\uff0c\u4f46\u53d7\u6cd5\u89c4\u9650\u5236\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff1b\u4e14\u9700\u8981\u53d1\u5c04\u63a5\u6536\u540c\u6b65\u548c\u53d1\u5c04\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u53d1\u5c04\u5668\u7684\u88ab\u52a8\u611f\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5b9a\u4e49\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u6784\u5efa\u5b8c\u5168\u88ab\u52a8\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u611f\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e24\u4e2a\u53cd\u5411\u63a5\u6536\u5668\u7684\u5dee\u5206\u7ed3\u6784\u6765\u6d88\u9664\u672a\u77e5\u6e90\u4fe1\u53f7\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u5931\u771f\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5df2\u77e5\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u91d1\u5c5e\u677f\uff0c\u591a\u666e\u52d2\u8c31\u56fe\u4e0e\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u4e00\u81f4\uff1b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\uff08\u6325\u624b\u3001\u5355\u4eba\u591a\u8fd0\u52a8\u68c0\u6d4b\uff09\u4e2d\u6210\u529f\u53cd\u6620\u76f8\u5e94\u8fd0\u52a8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u88ab\u52a8\u611f\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u5728\u4e0d\u5e72\u6270\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5229\u7528\u73af\u5883\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u901a\u4fe1\u4fe1\u53f7\u8fdb\u884c\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5404\u79cd\u76f2ISAC\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

As general-purpose AI systems are increasingly adopted, they are causing more real-world harms and displaying the potential to cause significantly more dangerous incidents - events that did or could have caused harm to individuals, property, or the environment. Through a literature review, we develop a framework for understanding the institutional design of AI incident reporting systems, which includes seven dimensions: policy goal, actors submitting and receiving reports, type of incidents reported, level of risk materialization, enforcement of reporting, anonymity of reporters, and post-reporting actions. We then examine nine case studies of incident reporting in safety-critical industries to extract design considerations for AI incident reporting in the United States. We discuss, among other factors, differences in systems operated by regulatory vs. non-regulatory government agencies, near miss reporting, the roles of mandatory reporting thresholds and voluntary reporting channels, how to enable safety learning after reporting, sharing incident information, and clarifying legal frameworks for reporting. Our aim is to inform researchers and policymakers about when particular design choices might be more or less appropriate for AI incident reporting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86AI\u4e8b\u4ef6\u62a5\u544a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u5236\u5ea6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8003\u8651\uff0c\u5305\u62ec7\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff1a\u653f\u7b56\u76ee\u6807\u3001\u62a5\u544a\u63d0\u4ea4\u548c\u63a5\u6536\u4e3b\u4f53\u3001\u62a5\u544a\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u98ce\u9669\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3001\u62a5\u544a\u6267\u884c\u3001\u62a5\u544a\u8005\u533f\u540d\u6027\u3001\u62a5\u544a\u540e\u884c\u52a8\u3002\u901a\u8fc79\u4e2a\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4e3a\u7f8e\u56fdAI\u4e8b\u4ef6\u62a5\u544a\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u901a\u7528AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e5\u76ca\u666e\u53ca\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u6b63\u5728\u9020\u6210\u66f4\u591a\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5371\u5bb3\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u53ef\u80fd\u5f15\u53d1\u66f4\u5371\u9669\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5efa\u7acb\u6709\u6548\u7684AI\u4e8b\u4ef6\u62a5\u544a\u7cfb\u7edf\u6765\u6536\u96c6\u5b89\u5168\u76f8\u5173\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86AI\u4e8b\u4ef6\u62a5\u544a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5236\u5ea6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e869\u4e2a\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u884c\u4e1a\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8003\u8651\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5305\u542b7\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684AI\u4e8b\u4ef6\u62a5\u544a\u7cfb\u7edf\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u76d1\u7ba1\u4e0e\u975e\u76d1\u7ba1\u653f\u5e9c\u673a\u6784\u8fd0\u8425\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3001\u672a\u9042\u4e8b\u4ef6\u62a5\u544a\u3001\u5f3a\u5236\u62a5\u544a\u9608\u503c\u4e0e\u81ea\u613f\u62a5\u544a\u6e20\u9053\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u4e8eAI\u4e8b\u4ef6\u62a5\u544a\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u786e\u5b9a\u5728\u4f55\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7279\u5b9a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\u53ef\u80fd\u66f4\u9002\u5408AI\u4e8b\u4ef6\u62a5\u544a\u3002"}}

Developing robotic systems that emulate human-like operational characteristics through musculoskeletal structures has long been a research focus. In this study, we designed a novel lightweight tendon-driven musculoskeletal arm (LTDM-Arm), featuring a seven degree-of-freedom (DOF) skeletal joint system and a modularized artificial muscular system (MAMS) with 15 actuators. Additionally, we employed a Hilly-type muscle model and data-driven iterative learning control (DDILC) to learn and refine activation signals for repetitive tasks within a finite time frame. We validated the anti-interference capabilities of the musculoskeletal system through both simulations and experiments. The results show that the LTDM-Arm system can effectively achieve desired trajectory tracking tasks, even under load disturbances of 20 % in simulation and 15 % in experiments.

The proposed neural architecture learns end-to-end mappings from receiver observations and sender signals to action predictions, eliminating the need to identify belief mechanisms explicitly. Conformal prediction constructs finite-sample valid prediction sets with provable marginal coverage, enabling principled, distribution-free robust optimization. We establish exact coverage guarantees for the data-generating policy and derive bounds on coverage degradation under policy shifts. Furthermore, we provide neural network approximation and estimation error bounds, with sample complexity $O(d \\log(|\\mathcal{U}||\\mathcal{Y}||\\mathcal{S}|)/\\varepsilon^2)$, where $d$ denotes the effective network dimension, and finite-sample lower bounds on the sender's expected utility.

However, their success hinges on navigating a fundamental cognitive tension: the need to balance broad, divergent exploration of the solution space with a principled, convergent synthesis to the optimal solution. Existing paradigms often struggle to manage this duality, leading to premature consensus, error propagation, and a critical credit assignment problem that fails to distinguish between genuine reasoning and superficially plausible arguments. To resolve this core challenge, we propose the Multi-Agent Exploration-Synthesis framework Through Role Orchestration (Maestro), a principled paradigm for collaboration that structurally decouples these cognitive modes. Maestro uses a collective of parallel Execution Agents for diverse exploration and a specialized Central Agent for convergent, evaluative synthesis. To operationalize this critical synthesis phase, we introduce Conditional Listwise Policy Optimization (CLPO), a reinforcement learning objective that disentangles signals for strategic decisions and tactical rationales. By combining decision-focused policy gradients with a list-wise ranking loss over justifications, CLPO achieves clean credit assignment and stronger comparative supervision. Experiments on mathematical reasoning and general problem-solving benchmarks demonstrate that Maestro, coupled with CLPO, consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art multi-agent approaches, delivering absolute accuracy gains of 6% on average and up to 10% at best.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Maestro\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89d2\u8272\u7f16\u6392\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u63a2\u7d22-\u5408\u6210\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408CLPO\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u96be\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0e\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u7684\u6536\u655b\u5408\u6210\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u51fa\u73b0\u8fc7\u65e9\u5171\u8bc6\u3001\u9519\u8bef\u4f20\u64ad\u548c\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "Maestro\u6846\u67b6\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u5730\u5206\u79bb\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u5408\u6210\u8ba4\u77e5\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528\u5e76\u884c\u6267\u884c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u6837\u5316\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u4e13\u7528\u4e2d\u592e\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fdb\u884c\u6536\u655b\u6027\u5408\u6210\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1b\u5f15\u5165CLPO\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u51b3\u7b56\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u548c\u7406\u7531\u7684\u5217\u8868\u6392\u5e8f\u635f\u5931\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u901a\u7528\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cMaestro\u7ed3\u5408CLPO\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u7edd\u5bf9\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u53476%\uff0c\u6700\u4f73\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63d0\u534710%\u3002", "conclusion": "Maestro\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u89d2\u8272\u7f16\u6392\u548cCLPO\u7684\u6709\u6548\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u63a2\u7d22-\u5408\u6210\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

Many existing systems use rigid mechanisms and bulky interfaces that impede force transmission and reduce wearability. This study introduces a soft sleeve actuation architecture that conforms to the limb while transmitting forces and moments efficiently. We develop three soft sleeve actuators that produce linear, bending, and twisting motion, and an omnidirectional design that combines these motions in one device. Actuators are fabricated from thermoplastic elastomers using a customized fused filament fabrication process that produces airtight and compliant structures and resolves leakage observed with conventional methods. A dedicated experimental platform quantifies kinematic outputs such as displacement, angle, and twist, and kinetic outputs such as force and torque under low pneumatic pressures. A parametric study varies geometric features and material properties to determine their influence on performance. Results show reproducible multi axis motion with improved transfer of force to the limb and reduced need for complex attachment hardware. The work establishes a unified and manufacturable framework for soft sleeve actuation that enables compact and user centered assistive technologies with enhanced kinematic and kinetic performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u67d4\u8f6f\u5957\u7b52\u9a71\u52a8\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5236\u9020\u7d27\u51d1\u3001\u7528\u6237\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u8f85\u52a9\u6280\u672f\u8bbe\u5907\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u7684\u7194\u878d\u957f\u4e1d\u5236\u9020\u5de5\u827a\u5236\u9020\u70ed\u5851\u6027\u5f39\u6027\u4f53\u9a71\u52a8\u5668\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ebf\u6027\u3001\u5f2f\u66f2\u548c\u626d\u8f6c\u8fd0\u52a8\u3002", "motivation": "\u8001\u9f84\u5316\u4eba\u53e3\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u808c\u8089\u9aa8\u9abc\u75be\u75c5\u60a3\u75c5\u7387\u4e0a\u5347\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u5bf9\u6709\u6548\u3001\u8212\u9002\u4e14\u89e3\u5256\u5b66\u517c\u5bb9\u7684\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u79fb\u52a8\u8f85\u52a9\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f7f\u7528\u521a\u6027\u673a\u5236\u548c\u7b28\u91cd\u63a5\u53e3\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u529b\u4f20\u9012\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u67d4\u8f6f\u5957\u7b52\u9a71\u52a8\u5668\uff08\u7ebf\u6027\u3001\u5f2f\u66f2\u3001\u626d\u8f6c\uff09\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u5168\u65b9\u4f4d\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u7194\u878d\u957f\u4e1d\u5236\u9020\u5de5\u827a\u5236\u9020\u6c14\u5bc6\u4e14\u67d4\u987a\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u4e13\u7528\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5e73\u53f0\u91cf\u5316\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u548c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u53ef\u91cd\u73b0\u7684\u591a\u8f74\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u5411\u80a2\u4f53\u7684\u529b\u4f20\u9012\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u9644\u7740\u786c\u4ef6\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u4e14\u53ef\u5236\u9020\u7684\u67d4\u8f6f\u5957\u7b52\u9a71\u52a8\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5177\u6709\u589e\u5f3a\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u548c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u7d27\u51d1\u578b\u7528\u6237\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8f85\u52a9\u6280\u672f\u3002"}}

Despite abundant empirical observations, the understanding of coherence in complex power networks remains incomplete where the dynamics could be highly heterogeneous, nonlinear, and increasingly affected by persistent disturbances such as renewable energy fluctuations. To bridge this gap, this paper extends the blended dynamics approach, originally rooted in consensus analysis of multi-agent systems, to develop a novel coherency analysis in power networks. We show that the frequency responses of coherent machines coupled by nonlinear power flow can be approximately represented by the blended dynamics, which is a weighted average of nonlinear heterogeneous nodal dynamics, even under time-varying disturbances. Specifically, by developing novel bounds on the difference between the trajectories of nodal dynamics and the blended dynamics, we identify two key factors -- either high network connectivity or small time-variation rate of disturbances -- that contribute to coherence. They enable the nodal frequencies to rapidly approach the blended-dynamics trajectory from arbitrary initial state. Furthermore, they ensure the frequencies closely follow this trajectory in the long term, even when the system does not settle to an equilibrium. These insights contribute to the understanding of power system coherency and are further supported by simulation results.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u6df7\u5408\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u590d\u6742\u7535\u529b\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u540c\u8c03\u6027\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7f51\u7edc\u9ad8\u8fde\u901a\u6027\u6216\u6270\u52a8\u65f6\u53d8\u7387\u5c0f\u662f\u4fc3\u8fdb\u540c\u8c03\u6027\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u540c\u8c03\u6027\u73b0\u8c61\u5df2\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u89c2\u5bdf\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u5f02\u8d28\u3001\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u4e14\u53d7\u6301\u7eed\u6270\u52a8\uff08\u5982\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u6ce2\u52a8\uff09\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u540c\u8c03\u6027\u7406\u89e3\u4ecd\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5171\u8bc6\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u7535\u529b\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u540c\u8c03\u6027\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u8282\u70b9\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e0e\u6df7\u5408\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u8f68\u8ff9\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u754c\u3002", "result": "\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u4e24\u4e2a\u4fc3\u8fdb\u540c\u8c03\u6027\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff1a\u9ad8\u7f51\u7edc\u8fde\u901a\u6027\u6216\u5c0f\u6270\u52a8\u65f6\u53d8\u7387\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u4f7f\u8282\u70b9\u9891\u7387\u80fd\u4ece\u4efb\u610f\u521d\u59cb\u72b6\u6001\u5feb\u901f\u63a5\u8fd1\u6df7\u5408\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u6df1\u5316\u4e86\u5bf9\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u540c\u8c03\u6027\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0d\u8d8b\u4e8e\u5e73\u8861\u65f6\uff0c\u8282\u70b9\u9891\u7387\u4e5f\u80fd\u957f\u671f\u7d27\u5bc6\u8ddf\u968f\u6df7\u5408\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002"}}

We hypothesize that explicitly disentangled object-level representations, by localizing task-relevant information, can enhance policy performance across novel feature combinations. To test this hypothesis, we introduce DLPWM, a fully unsupervised, disentangled object-centric world model that learns object-level latents directly from pixels. DLPWM achieves strong reconstruction and prediction performance, including robustness to several out-of-distribution (OOD) visual variations.

These sources and loads typically rectify the grid AC to DC, e.g., for a DC link, so that a DC grid could eliminate hardware and losses of these conversion stages. However, extended DC grids lack the stabilizing nature of AC impedances so that the voltage is more fragile and power flows may need active control, particularly if redundancy as known from AC, such as rings and meshing, is desired. Furthermore, a DC infrastructure will not replace but will need to interface with the existing AC grid. This paper presents a partial-power energy router architecture that can interface multiple AC and DC lines to enable precise control of voltages and both active as well as reactive power flows. The proposed system uses modular low-voltage high-current series modules supplied through dual active bridges. These modules only need to process a small share of the voltage to control large power flows. The topology reduces component size, cost, energy losses, and reliability more than three times compared to conventional technology. The optional integration of battery energy storage can furthermore eliminate the need for the sum of the power flows of all inputs to be zero at all times. Through dynamic voltage injection relative to the line voltage, the modules effectively balance feeder currents, regulate reactive power, and improve the power factor in AC grids. Real-time hardware-in-the-loop and prototype measurements validate the proposed energy router's performance under diverse operating conditions. Experimental results confirm the series module's functionality in both AC and DC grids as an effective solution for controlling extended grids, including power sharing, voltage, and power quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u90e8\u5206\u529f\u7387\u80fd\u91cf\u8def\u7531\u5668\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u4f4e\u538b\u5927\u7535\u6d41\u4e32\u8054\u6a21\u5757\u63a7\u5236\u7535\u538b\u548c\u529f\u7387\u6d41\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u6280\u672f\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c0f\u5c3a\u5bf8\u3001\u6210\u672c\u548c\u635f\u8017\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u3001\u8d1f\u8f7d\u548c\u50a8\u80fd\u5728\u4f4e\u538b\u548c\u4e2d\u538b\u7535\u7f51\u4e2d\u7684\u5360\u6bd4\u589e\u52a0\uff0cDC\u7535\u7f51\u53ef\u6d88\u9664AC-DC\u8f6c\u6362\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u548c\u635f\u8017\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u4e3b\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u7535\u538b\u548c\u529f\u7387\u6d41\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709AC\u7535\u7f51\u63a5\u53e3\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u4f4e\u538b\u5927\u7535\u6d41\u4e32\u8054\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u6709\u6e90\u6865\u4f9b\u7535\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u5904\u7406\u5c0f\u90e8\u5206\u7535\u538b\u5373\u53ef\u63a7\u5236\u5927\u529f\u7387\u6d41\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u96c6\u6210\u7535\u6c60\u50a8\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u80fd\u91cf\u8def\u7531\u5668\u5728AC\u548cDC\u7535\u7f51\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u786e\u8ba4\u5176\u5728\u529f\u7387\u5206\u914d\u3001\u7535\u538b\u548c\u7535\u80fd\u8d28\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u62d3\u6251\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u6280\u672f\u5c06\u7ec4\u4ef6\u5c3a\u5bf8\u3001\u6210\u672c\u3001\u80fd\u91cf\u635f\u8017\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u6539\u5584\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e09\u500d\uff0c\u662f\u63a7\u5236\u6269\u5c55\u7535\u7f51\u7684\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, for multi-agent planning, MCTS is confronted with a large combinatorial action space that often grows exponentially with the number of agents. As a result, the branching factor of MCTS during tree expansion also increases exponentially, making it very difficult to efficiently explore and exploit during tree search. To this end, we propose MALinZero, a new approach to leverage low-dimensional representational structures on joint-action returns and enable efficient MCTS in complex multi-agent planning. Our solution can be viewed as projecting the joint-action returns into the low-dimensional space representable using a contextual linear bandit problem formulation. We solve the contextual linear bandit problem with convex and $\u03bc$-smooth loss functions -- in order to place more importance on better joint actions and mitigate potential representational limitations -- and derive a linear Upper Confidence Bound applied to trees (LinUCT) to enable novel multi-agent exploration and exploitation in the low-dimensional space. We analyze the regret of MALinZero for low-dimensional reward functions and propose an $(1-\\tfrac1e)$-approximation algorithm for the joint action selection by maximizing a sub-modular objective.

In our work, we raise concerns about cultural and genre biases in AI for music systems (music-AI systems) which affect stakeholders including creators, distributors, and listeners shaping representation in AI for music.

However, the vast complexity of outdoor aerial environments compounds data acquisition challenges and imposes long-horizon trajectory planning requirements on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), introducing novel complexities for aerial VLN. To address these challenges, we propose a data-efficient Open-world aerial Vision-Language Navigation (i.e., OpenVLN) framework, which could execute language-guided flight with limited data constraints and enhance long-horizon trajectory planning capabilities in complex aerial environments. Specifically, we reconfigure a reinforcement learning framework to optimize the VLM for UAV navigation tasks, which can efficiently fine-tune VLM by using rule-based policies under limited training data. Concurrently, we introduce a long-horizon planner for trajectory synthesis that dynamically generates precise UAV actions via value-based rewards. To the end, we conduct sufficient navigation experiments on the TravelUAV benchmark with dataset scaling across diverse reward settings.

Recent research has increasingly focused on developing such simulated agents to capture a range of learning styles, cognitive development pathways, and social behaviours. Among contemporary simulation techniques, the integration of large language models (LLMs) into educational research has emerged as a particularly versatile and scalable paradigm. LLMs afford a high degree of linguistic realism and behavioural adaptability, enabling agents to approximate cognitive processes and engage in contextually appropriate pedagogical dialogues. This paper presents a thematic review of empirical and methodological studies utilising LLMs to simulate student behaviour across educational environments. We synthesise current evidence on the capacity of LLM-based agents to emulate learner archetypes, respond to instructional inputs, and interact within multi-agent classroom scenarios.

In many real-world applications, consistent high performance on a limited set of tasks is more important than broad generalization. We propose ExpReS-VLA, a method for specializing pre-trained VLA models through experience replay and retrieval while preventing catastrophic forgetting. ExpReS-VLA stores compact feature representations from the frozen vision backbone instead of raw image-action pairs, reducing memory usage by approximately 97 percent. During deployment, relevant past experiences are retrieved using cosine similarity and used to guide adaptation, while prioritized experience replay emphasizes successful trajectories. We also introduce Thresholded Hybrid Contrastive Loss, which enables learning from both successful and failed attempts. On the LIBERO simulation benchmark, ExpReS-VLA improves success rates from 82.6 to 93.1 percent on spatial reasoning tasks and from 61 to 72.3 percent on long-horizon tasks. On physical robot experiments with five manipulation tasks, it reaches 98 percent success on both seen and unseen settings, compared to 84.7 and 32 percent for naive fine-tuning.

However, it has been established that the charging of EVs can destabilize the grid when they penetrate the market in large numbers, especially in grids that were not initially built to handle the load from the charging of EVs. In this work, we present a dynamic EV charging pricing strategy that fulfills the following three objectives: distribution network-level load peak-shaving, valley-filling, and load balancing across distribution networks. Based on historical environmental variables such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, EV charging prices and distribution of vehicles in different areas in different times of the day, we first forecast the distribution network load demand, and then use deep reinforcement learning approach to set the optimal dynamic EV charging price. While most research seeks to achieve load peak-shaving and valley-filling to stabilize the grid, our work goes further into exploring the load-balancing between the distribution networks in the close vicinity to each other. We compare the performance of Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithms for this purpose. The best algorithm is used for dymamic EV pricing.

This study examines the digital manifestation of Taiwanese gastrodiplomacy by focusing on bubble tea -- a culturally iconic beverage -- leveraging a dataset comprising 107,169 posts from the popular lifestyle social media platform Instagram. Including 315,279,227 engagements, 4,756,320 comments, and 8,097,260,651 views over five full years (2020--2024), we investigate how social media facilitates discussion about Taiwanese cuisine and contributes to Taiwan's digital soft power. Our analysis reveals that bubble tea consistently emerges as the dominant representation of Taiwanese cuisine across Meta's Instagram channels. However, this dominance also indicates vulnerability in gastrodiplomatic strategy compared to other countries. Additionally, we find evidence that Instagram suppresses bubble tea posts mentioning Taiwan by 1,200\\% -- roughly a twelve--fold decrease in exposure -- relative to posts without such mentions. Crucially, we observe a significant drop in the number of posts, views, and engagement following Lai's inauguration in May 2024. This study ultimately contributes to understanding how digital platforms can enable or disable gastrodiplomacy, soft power, and cultural diplomacy while highlighting the need for greater algorithmic transparency.

In this paper, we argue that the predominant approach of simply removing existing biases from models is not enough. Using a paradigm from the psychology literature, we demonstrate that LLMs can spontaneously develop novel social biases about artificial demographic groups even when no inherent differences exist. These biases result in highly stratified task allocations, which are less fair than assignments by human participants and are exacerbated by newer and larger models. In social science, emergent biases like these have been shown to result from exploration-exploitation trade-offs, where the decision-maker explores too little, allowing early observations to strongly influence impressions about entire demographic groups. To alleviate this effect, we examine a series of interventions targeting model inputs, problem structure, and explicit steering. We find that explicitly incentivizing exploration most robustly reduces stratification, highlighting the need for better multifaceted objectives to mitigate bias. These results reveal that LLMs are not merely passive mirrors of human social biases, but can actively create new ones from experience, raising urgent questions about how these systems will shape societies over time.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLMs\u80fd\u81ea\u53d1\u4ea7\u751f\u5bf9\u4eba\u5de5\u4eba\u53e3\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u65b0\u793e\u4f1a\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7fa4\u4f53\u95f4\u4e0d\u5b58\u5728\u56fa\u6709\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u504f\u89c1\u5bfc\u81f4\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u914d\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5206\u5c42\uff0c\u6bd4\u4eba\u7c7b\u5206\u914d\u66f4\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u66f4\u4e25\u91cd\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u63a2\u7d22-\u5229\u7528\u6743\u8861\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u660e\u786e\u6fc0\u52b1\u63a2\u7d22\u80fd\u6700\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u5206\u5c42\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740LLMs\u88ab\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u80fd\u591f\u505a\u51fa\u5b9e\u9645\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5b83\u4eec\u65e0\u504f\u89c1\u53d8\u5f97\u6108\u53d1\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u6d88\u9664\u5df2\u6709\u504f\u89c1\u662f\u4e0d\u591f\u7684\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76LLMs\u662f\u5426\u4f1a\u81ea\u53d1\u4ea7\u751f\u65b0\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u7814\u7a76LLMs\u5bf9\u4eba\u5de5\u4eba\u53e3\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u5f62\u6210\u3002\u8003\u5bdf\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u5165\u3001\u95ee\u9898\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u660e\u786e\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u63a2\u7d22-\u5229\u7528\u6743\u8861\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "LLMs\u786e\u5b9e\u4f1a\u81ea\u53d1\u4ea7\u751f\u65b0\u793e\u4f1a\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u914d\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5206\u5c42\uff0c\u4e14\u8fd9\u79cd\u73b0\u8c61\u5728\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u66f4\u4e25\u91cd\u3002\u660e\u786e\u6fc0\u52b1\u63a2\u7d22\u662f\u6700\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\uff0c\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u5206\u5c42\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMs\u4e0d\u4ec5\u662f\u4eba\u7c7b\u793e\u4f1a\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u88ab\u52a8\u53cd\u6620\u8005\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u4ece\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4e2d\u4e3b\u52a8\u521b\u9020\u65b0\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5982\u4f55\u5851\u9020\u793e\u4f1a\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7d27\u8feb\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Existing approaches typically navigate to proximity-based regions without considering affordances, resulting in frequent manipulation failures. We propose Affordance-Guided Coarse-to-Fine Exploration, a zero-shot framework for base placement that integrates semantic understanding from vision-language models (VLMs) with geometric feasibility through an iterative optimization process. Our method constructs cross-modal representations, namely Affordance RGB and Obstacle Map+, to align semantics with spatial context. This enables reasoning that extends beyond the egocentric limitations of RGB perception. To ensure interaction is guided by task-relevant affordances, we leverage coarse semantic priors from VLMs to guide the search toward task-relevant regions and refine placements with geometric constraints, thereby reducing the risk of convergence to local optima. Evaluated on five diverse open-vocabulary mobile manipulation tasks, our system achieves an 85% success rate, significantly outperforming classical geometric planners and VLM-based methods.

The basic minimum requirement for the choice of a sensor set while designing Kalman filters is that all states are observable. In addition, the sensors should be chosen with a view towards estimating the states with a desired accuracy. Often observability is treated as true/false check during filter design. Beyond observability -- the observability degree -- which measures \\emph{how observable} the states are, has been used as the metric of choice to for sensor selection or placement applications. The higher the degree of observability, the better the possibility of designing Kalman filters that achieve the desired state estimation accuracy and consistency requirements. When a wide variety of sensors are available, sometimes with cost and physical constraints involved, sensor selection plays a crucial role in filter design. In such situations it is important to know the expected contribution of each sensor towards observability degree. Shapley values, developed in cooperative game theory for fair allocation of the payout of a multi-player game to individual players, are widely used in machine learning to assess feature importance. This paper shows that Shapley values can indeed be leveraged to quantify the expected marginal contribution of each sensor in any given sensor set towards the observability degree. This quantification of the fair contribution of each sensor towards the observability degree can be leveraged by filter designers for sensor selection, placement and filter (state estimator) design.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684Shapley\u503c\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5bf9\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u5ea6\u7684\u8fb9\u9645\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u9009\u62e9\u5728\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u5e38\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ea\u5173\u6ce8\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027\uff08\u771f/\u5047\u5224\u65ad\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u4e2a\u4f53\u8d21\u732e\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u5f53\u5b58\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u4e14\u53d7\u6210\u672c\u548c\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u65f6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7684\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684Shapley\u503c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u9009\u62e9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5bf9\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u5ea6\u7684\u8fb9\u9645\u8d21\u732e\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u5176\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "result": "Shapley\u503c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u91cf\u5316\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u5ea6\u7684\u9884\u671f\u8fb9\u9645\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u4f9b\u516c\u5e73\u5206\u914d\u7684\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "Shapley\u503c\u4e3a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u5e03\u5c40\u548c\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cf\u5316\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5e2e\u52a9\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8005\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5bf9\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u5ea6\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u505a\u51fa\u66f4\u660e\u667a\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u51b3\u7b56\u3002"}}

We introduce CSP4SDG, a probabilistic, constraint-satisfaction framework that analyses gameplay objectively. Game events and dialogue are mapped to four linguistically-agnostic constraint classes-evidence, phenomena, assertions, and hypotheses. Hard constraints prune impossible role assignments, while weighted soft constraints score the remainder; information-gain weighting links each hypothesis to its expected value under entropy reduction, and a simple closed-form scoring rule guarantees that truthful assertions converge to classical hard logic with minimum error. The resulting posterior over roles is fully interpretable and updates in real time.

Recent work introduced efficient first-order randomized smoothing to make witness points differentiable; however, their direction-based formulation is restricted to convex objects and lacks robustness for complex geometries.

This construct leads to increased approximation accuracy of the state transition tensors and improved Gaussian moment propagation for nonlinear flight scenarios like aerocapture.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u79fb\u5f20\u91cf\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u79e9-1\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6c42\u89e3\u5f20\u91cfz-\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u95ee\u9898\u6765\u6700\u5927\u5316\u4fe1\u606f\u4fdd\u7559\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u79fb\u5f20\u91cf\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u9ad8\u65af\u77e9\u4f20\u64ad\u5728\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u98de\u884c\u573a\u666f\uff08\u5982\u6c14\u52a8\u6355\u83b7\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6c42\u89e3\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u79fb\u5f20\u91cf\"\u5e73\u65b9\"\u7684z-\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6784\u9020\u6700\u4f18\u79e9-1\u65b9\u5411\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u79fb\u5f20\u91cf\uff0c\u5728Frobenius\u8303\u6570\u610f\u4e49\u4e0a\u6700\u5927\u5316\u4fe1\u606f\u4fdd\u7559\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u79fb\u5f20\u91cf\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u98de\u884c\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u77e9\u4f20\u64ad\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6700\u4f18\u79e9-1\u65b9\u5411\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u79fb\u5f20\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002"}}

Locating the sensor off the contact interface reduces damage risk, preserves softness, and simplifies fabrication and maintenance. We first characterize the optical sensing element and the compliant skin, thendetermine the design of a prototype tactile sensor. Compression experiments validate the approach, exhibiting a monotonic force output relationship consistent with theory, low hysteresis, high repeatability over repeated cycles, and small response indentation speeds. We further demonstrate integration on a soft robotic gripper, where the module reliably detects grasp events. Compared with liquid filled or wireembedded tactile skins, the proposed modular add on architecture enhances durability, reduces wiring complexity, and supports straightforward deployment across diverse robot geometries. Because the sensing principle reads skin strain patterns, it also suggests extensions to other somatosensory cues such as joint angle or actuator state estimation from surface deformation.

This is common in MV circuits of industrial and power plants. Unearthed networks can remain in operation during an earth-fault, but fast determination of the faulty line is key for prevention of further fault escalation. Signal injection is one of the fault location methods often used in LV unearthed networks. The possibility of applying this method in MV networks depends on how to inject the signal into unearthed phases.

Previous work has shown that verifying the correctness of individual reasoning steps can further improve the performance and efficiency of LLMs on such tasks and enhance solution interpretability. However, existing verification approaches, such as Process Reward Models (PRMs), are either computationally expensive, limited to specific domains, or require large-scale human or model-generated annotations. Thus, we propose a lightweight alternative for step-level reasoning verification based on data-driven uncertainty scores. We train transformer-based uncertainty quantification heads (UHeads) that use the internal states of a frozen LLM to estimate the uncertainty of its reasoning steps during generation. The approach is fully automatic: target labels are generated either by another larger LLM (e.g., DeepSeek R1) or in a self-supervised manner by the original model itself. UHeads are both effective and lightweight, containing less than 10M parameters. Across multiple domains, including mathematics, planning, and general knowledge question answering, they match or even surpass the performance of PRMs that are up to 810x larger. Our findings suggest that the internal states of LLMs encode their uncertainty and can serve as reliable signals for reasoning verification, offering a promising direction toward scalable and generalizable introspective LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6570\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3transformer\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u5934\u6765\u5229\u7528LLM\u5185\u90e8\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5927\u91cf\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u53ef\u4e0e\u5927810\u500d\u7684PRMs\u76f8\u5ab2\u7f8e\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u63a8\u7406\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u9886\u57df\u53d7\u9650\u6216\u9700\u8981\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u3001\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u6765\u9a8c\u8bc1LLM\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8bad\u7ec3transformer\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u5934\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u51bb\u7ed3LLM\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u72b6\u6001\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u6807\u7b7e\u7531\u66f4\u5927LLM\u6216\u539f\u59cb\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u5c0f\u4e8e10M\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u3001\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u5e38\u8bc6\u95ee\u7b54\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u5339\u914d\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8fc7\u6bd4\u5176\u5927810\u500d\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8868\u660eLLM\u5185\u90e8\u72b6\u6001\u7f16\u7801\u4e86\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u5185\u90e8\u72b6\u6001\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u63a8\u7406\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u81ea\u7701LLMs\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

In this paper, we examine the psychological and opinion barriers that limit engagement with extinction narratives, such as mortality avoidance, exponential growth bias, and the absence of self-referential anchors. We contrast them with evidence that public concern over AI rises when framed in terms of proximate harms such as employment disruption, relational instability, and mental health issues. We validate these findings through actual message testing with 1063 respondents, with the evidence showing that AI risks to Jobs and Children have the highest potential to mobilize people, while Existential Risk is the lowest-performing theme across all demographics. Using survey data from five countries, we identify two segments (Tech-Positive Urbanites and World Guardians) as particularly receptive to such framing and more likely to participate in civic action. Finally, we argue that mobilization around these everyday concerns can raise the political salience of AI, creating \"policy demand\" for structural measures to mitigate AI risks.

However, existing methods predominantly require training independent policies for each skill, yielding behavior-specific controllers that exhibit limited generalization and brittle performance when deployed on irregular terrains and in diverse situations. To address this challenge, we propose Adaptive Humanoid Control (AHC) that adopts a two-stage framework to learn an adaptive humanoid locomotion controller across different skills and terrains. Specifically, we first train several primary locomotion policies and perform a multi-behavior distillation process to obtain a basic multi-behavior controller, facilitating adaptive behavior switching based on the environment. Then, we perform reinforced fine-tuning by collecting online feedback in performing adaptive behaviors on more diverse terrains, enhancing terrain adaptability for the controller.

Solar energy, while offering significant environmental and economic benefits, faces challenges when connected to transmission lines that are prone to lightning discharges. This paper investigates the impact of lightning events on solar power plants, focusing on overvoltage effects. Lightning stroke simulations were conducted at various distances from the solar power plant along the transmission line, considering scenarios with and without surge arrester. Key lightning parameters such as peak current, front time, and tail time were varied to simulate different lightning strokes. The study also includes a Fourier transform analysis of the resulting overvoltages with and without a surge arrester, along with the Hilbert marginal spectrum of these overvoltages. The results provide insights into the effectiveness of surge arresters in mitigating lightning overvoltages and highlight the importance of proper protective measures for enhancing the reliability and safety of solar power plants connected to transmission networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u96f7\u7535\u5bf9\u592a\u9633\u80fd\u53d1\u7535\u5382\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6709\u65e0\u907f\u96f7\u5668\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u8fc7\u7535\u538b\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u907f\u96f7\u5668\u5728\u51cf\u8f7b\u96f7\u51fb\u8fc7\u7535\u538b\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u592a\u9633\u80fd\u53d1\u7535\u5382\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u63a5\u5165\u8f93\u7535\u7535\u7f51\uff0c\u5176\u6613\u53d7\u96f7\u51fb\u7b49\u5e72\u6270\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u5f15\u53d1\u5173\u6ce8\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u4fdd\u62a4\u63aa\u65bd\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u8f93\u7535\u7ebf\u8def\u4e0d\u540c\u8ddd\u79bb\u5904\u8fdb\u884c\u96f7\u51fb\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u53d8\u5316\u5cf0\u503c\u7535\u6d41\u3001\u6ce2\u524d\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u6ce2\u5c3e\u65f6\u95f4\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u53d8\u6362\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5e0c\u5c14\u4f2f\u7279\u8fb9\u9645\u8c31\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u907f\u96f7\u5668\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u8f7b\u96f7\u51fb\u8fc7\u7535\u538b\uff0c\u4e3a\u592a\u9633\u80fd\u53d1\u7535\u5382\u7684\u4fdd\u62a4\u63aa\u65bd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u4fdd\u62a4\u63aa\u65bd\u5bf9\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad8\u63a5\u5165\u8f93\u7535\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u592a\u9633\u80fd\u53d1\u7535\u5382\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u907f\u96f7\u5668\u662f\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9632\u62a4\u624b\u6bb5\u3002"}}

This challenges the prevailing approach of scaling model parameters to enhance capabilities, as seen in models like DeepSeek R1 (671B) and Kimi k2 (>1T). The SSP framework first employs a Two-Stage Diversity-Exploring Distillation (SFT) to generate a broad spectrum of solutions, followed by MaxEnt-Guided Policy Optimization (RL) to amplify the correct signal. With a total training cost of only $7,800, VibeThinker-1.5B demonstrates superior reasoning capabilities compared to closed-source models like Magistral Medium and Claude Opus 4, and performs on par with open-source models like GPT OSS-20B Medium. Remarkably, it surpasses the 400x larger DeepSeek R1 on three math benchmarks: AIME24 (80.3 vs. 79.8), AIME25 (74.4 vs. 70.0), and HMMT25 (50.4 vs. 41.7). This is a substantial improvement over its base model (6.7, 4.3, and 0.6, respectively). On LiveCodeBench V6, it scores 51.1, outperforming Magistral Medium's 50.3 and its base model's 0.0.

Quantifying these differences is critical to understanding if the quality of the legal information obtained by users of LLM-based chatbots varies depending on their location. However, obtaining meaningful comparative metrics is challenging because legal institutions in different places are not themselves easily comparable. In this work we propose a methodology to obtain place-to-place metrics based on the comparative law concept of functionalism. We construct a dataset of factual scenarios drawn from Reddit posts by users seeking legal advice for family, housing, employment, crime and traffic issues. We use these to elicit a summary of a law from the LLM relevant to each scenario in Los Angeles, London and Sydney. These summaries, typically of a legislative provision, are manually evaluated for hallucinations. We show that the rate of hallucination of legal information by leading closed-source LLMs is significantly associated with place. This suggests that the quality of legal solutions provided by these models is not evenly distributed across geography. Additionally, we show a strong negative correlation between hallucination rate and the frequency of the majority response when the LLM is sampled multiple times, suggesting a measure of uncertainty of model predictions of legal facts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6bd4\u8f83\u6cd5\u529f\u80fd\u4e3b\u4e49\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5730\u533a\u6cd5\u5f8b\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5728\u6d1b\u6749\u77f6\u3001\u4f26\u6566\u548c\u6089\u5c3c\u4e09\u4e2a\u5730\u533a\uff0c\u4e3b\u6d41\u95ed\u6e90LLM\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4fe1\u606f\u5e7b\u89c9\u7387\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5730\u7406\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5316LLM\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5730\u533a\u6cd5\u5f8b\u77e5\u8bc6\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5411\u7528\u6237\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4fe1\u606f\u8d28\u91cf\u662f\u5426\u56e0\u5730\u7406\u4f4d\u7f6e\u800c\u5f02\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u5730\u533a\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5236\u5ea6\u672c\u8eab\u96be\u4ee5\u76f4\u63a5\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\u6307\u6807\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6bd4\u8f83\u6cd5\u529f\u80fd\u4e3b\u4e49\u6982\u5ff5\u6784\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4eceReddit\u7528\u6237\u5bfb\u6c42\u6cd5\u5f8b\u54a8\u8be2\u7684\u5e16\u5b50\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u5bb6\u5ead\u3001\u4f4f\u623f\u3001\u5c31\u4e1a\u3001\u72af\u7f6a\u548c\u4ea4\u901a\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u573a\u666f\u5728\u6d1b\u6749\u77f6\u3001\u4f26\u6566\u548c\u6089\u5c3c\u4e09\u4e2a\u5730\u533a\u4eceLLM\u83b7\u53d6\u76f8\u5173\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6458\u8981\uff0c\u5e76\u624b\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u5e7b\u89c9\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "result": "\u4e3b\u6d41\u95ed\u6e90LLM\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4fe1\u606f\u5e7b\u89c9\u7387\u4e0e\u5730\u7406\u4f4d\u7f6e\u663e\u8457\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u8d28\u91cf\u5728\u5730\u7406\u4e0a\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5747\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5e7b\u89c9\u7387\u4e0eLLM\u591a\u6b21\u91c7\u6837\u65f6\u591a\u6570\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u9891\u7387\u5448\u5f3a\u8d1f\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4e8b\u5b9e\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8861\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u77e5\u8bc6\u8d28\u91cf\u5b58\u5728\u5730\u7406\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4e8b\u5b9e\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u5e7b\u89c9\u7387\u4e0e\u591a\u6570\u54cd\u5e94\u9891\u7387\u7684\u8d1f\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u6765\u8861\u91cf\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u6539\u8fdbLLM\u5728\u6cd5\u5f8b\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

The ability to perceive, track, and manipulate these objects without prior knowledge of their geometry or kinematic properties remains a fundamental challenge in robotics. In this work, we present a novel method for visuo-tactile-based tracking of unseen objects (single, multiple, or articulated) during robotic interaction without assuming any prior knowledge regarding object shape or dynamics. Our novel pose tracking approach termed ArtReg (stands for Articulated Registration) integrates visuo-tactile point clouds in an unscented Kalman Filter formulation in the SE(3) Lie Group for point cloud registration. ArtReg is used to detect possible articulated joints in objects using purposeful manipulation maneuvers such as pushing or hold-pulling with a two-robot team. Furthermore, we leverage ArtReg to develop a closed-loop controller for goal-driven manipulation of articulated objects to move the object into the desired pose configuration. We have extensively evaluated our approach on various types of unknown objects through real robot experiments. We also demonstrate the robustness of our method by evaluating objects with varying center of mass, low-light conditions, and with challenging visual backgrounds. Furthermore, we benchmarked our approach on a standard dataset of articulated objects and demonstrated improved performance in terms of pose accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our experiments indicate that robust and accurate pose tracking leveraging visuo-tactile information enables robots to perceive and interact with unseen complex articulated objects (with revolute or prismatic joints).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aArtReg\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4ea4\u4e92\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5bf9\u672a\u77e5\u7269\u4f53\uff08\u5355\u4e2a\u3001\u591a\u4e2a\u6216\u94f0\u63a5\u5f0f\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u89c6\u89c9\u89e6\u89c9\u8ddf\u8e2a\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5047\u8bbe\u7269\u4f53\u5f62\u72b6\u6216\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "motivation": "\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7ecf\u5e38\u9047\u5230\u5177\u6709\u590d\u6742\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u94f0\u63a5\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u672a\u77e5\u7269\u4f53\uff0c\u5982\u95e8\u3001\u62bd\u5c49\u3001\u6a71\u67dc\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u3002\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u5148\u9a8c\u51e0\u4f55\u6216\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u8ddf\u8e2a\u548c\u64cd\u7eb5\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7269\u4f53\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b66\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "ArtReg\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728SE(3)\u674e\u7fa4\u4e2d\u96c6\u6210\u89c6\u89c9\u89e6\u89c9\u70b9\u4e91\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u65e0\u8ff9\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u70b9\u4e91\u914d\u51c6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u63a8\u6216\u62c9\u7b49\u6709\u76ee\u7684\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u52a8\u4f5c\u68c0\u6d4b\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u94f0\u63a5\u5173\u8282\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u95ed\u73af\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u76ee\u6807\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u94f0\u63a5\u7269\u4f53\u64cd\u7eb5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8d28\u5fc3\u3001\u4f4e\u5149\u7167\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u6311\u6218\u6027\u89c6\u89c9\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u94f0\u63a5\u7269\u4f53\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u59ff\u6001\u7cbe\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u89e6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u59ff\u6001\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4f7f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u80fd\u591f\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u590d\u6742\u94f0\u63a5\u7269\u4f53\uff08\u5177\u6709\u65cb\u8f6c\u6216\u68f1\u67f1\u5173\u8282\uff09\u3002"}}

However, existing methods often assume ideal conditions, overlooking challenges such as sensor failures, environmental disturbances, and data imperfections, which can significantly degrade prediction accuracy. Additionally, previous models have not adequately addressed the considerable variability in driver behavior and accident rates across different vehicle types. To overcome these limitations, this study introduces ROAR, a novel approach for accident detection and prediction. ROAR combines Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), a self adaptive object aware module, and dynamic focal loss to tackle these challenges. The DWT effectively extracts features from noisy and incomplete data, while the object aware module improves accident prediction by focusing on high-risk vehicles and modeling the spatial temporal relationships among traffic agents. Moreover, dynamic focal loss mitigates the impact of class imbalance between positive and negative samples. Evaluated on three widely used datasets, Dashcam Accident Dataset (DAD), Car Crash Dataset (CCD), and AnAn Accident Detection (A3D), our model consistently outperforms existing baselines in key metrics such as Average Precision (AP) and mean Time to Accident (mTTA). These results demonstrate the model's robustness in real-world conditions, particularly in handling sensor degradation, environmental noise, and imbalanced data distributions.

However, they cannot guarantee safe behavior, so external safety mechanisms are needed. These, however, alter actions in ways unseen during training, causing unpredictable behavior and performance degradation. To address these problems, we propose path-consistent safety filtering (PACS) for DPs. Our approach performs path-consistent braking on a trajectory computed from the sequence of generated actions. In this way, we keep execution consistent with the policy's training distribution, maintaining the learned, task-completing behavior. To enable a real-time deployment and handle uncertainties, we verify safety using set-based reachability analysis. Our experimental evaluation in simulation and on three challenging real-world human-robot interaction tasks shows that PACS (a) provides formal safety guarantees in dynamic environments, (b) preserves task success rates, and (c) outperforms reactive safety approaches, such as control barrier functions, by up to 68% in terms of task success.

We jointly answer two resilience-related research questions: (Q1) Survivability: Upon having an extreme event/contingency, will the system remain feasible with voltage staying within a (preferred) safe range? (Q2) Dominant Vulnerability: If voltage collapses, what are the dominant sources of system vulnerabilities responsible for the failure? This highlights some key locations worth paying attention to in the planning or decision-making process. To address these questions, we propose a voltage-regulated sparse optimization that finds a minimal set of bus locations along with quantified compensations (corrective actions) that can simultaneously enforce AC network balance and voltage bounds. Results on transmission systems of varying sizes (30-bus to 2383-bus) demonstrate that the proposed method effectively mitigates voltage collapses by compensating at only a few strategically identified nodes, while scaling efficiently to large systems, taking on average less than 4 min for 2000+ bus cases.

Prior work on large language model negotiation largely emphasizes autonomous bargaining between agents and omits practical needs such as staged information gathering, explicit authorization boundaries, and systematic feedback integration. We propose GAIA, a governance-first framework for LLM-human agency in B2B negotiation and screening. GAIA defines three essential roles - Principal (human), Delegate (LLM agent), and Counterparty - with an optional Critic to enhance performance, and organizes interactions through three mechanisms: information-gated progression that separates screening from negotiation; dual feedback integration that combines AI critique with lightweight human corrections; and authorization boundaries with explicit escalation paths. Our contributions are fourfold: (1) a formal governance framework with three coordinated mechanisms and four safety invariants for delegation with bounded authorization; (2) information-gated progression via task-completeness tracking (TCI) and explicit state transitions that separate screening from commitment; (3) dual feedback integration that blends Critic suggestions with human oversight through parallel learning channels; and (4) a hybrid validation blueprint that combines automated protocol metrics with human judgment of outcomes and safety. By bridging theory and practice, GAIA offers a reproducible specification for safe, efficient, and accountable AI delegation that can be instantiated across procurement, real estate, and staffing workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "GAIA\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9762\u5411B2B\u8c08\u5224\u548c\u7b5b\u9009\u7684\u6cbb\u7406\u4f18\u5148\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u4e49\u89d2\u8272\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\u3001\u53cc\u91cd\u53cd\u9988\u96c6\u6210\u548c\u6388\u6743\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u786e\u4fddAI\u59d4\u6258\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u5ba1\u8ba1\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669B2B\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u53d7\u5230\u6cbb\u7406\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u9632\u6b62\u672a\u7ecf\u6388\u6743\u7684\u627f\u8bfa\u3001\u786e\u4fdd\u5145\u5206\u4fe1\u606f\u6536\u96c6\u5e76\u7ef4\u6301\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u76d1\u7763\u3002", "method": "\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u89d2\u8272\uff08\u59d4\u6258\u4eba\u3001\u4ee3\u7406\u3001\u5bf9\u65b9\uff09\u548c\u53ef\u9009\u6279\u8bc4\u8005\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4fe1\u606f\u95e8\u63a7\u8fdb\u5c55\u3001\u53cc\u91cd\u53cd\u9988\u96c6\u6210\u548c\u6388\u6743\u8fb9\u754c\u4e09\u79cd\u534f\u8c03\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u7684\u89c4\u8303\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4efb\u52a1\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u8ddf\u8e2a\u3001\u660e\u786e\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u6362\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5b89\u5168\u9ad8\u6548\u7684AI\u59d4\u6258\u3002", "conclusion": "GAIA\u901a\u8fc7\u8fde\u63a5\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8df5\uff0c\u4e3a\u91c7\u8d2d\u3001\u623f\u5730\u4ea7\u548c\u4eba\u5458\u914d\u7f6e\u7b49\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u548c\u53ef\u95ee\u8d23\u7684AI\u59d4\u6258\u89c4\u8303\u3002"}}

It is hotly debated whether data protection law applies to behavioural targeting. Many behavioural targeting companies say that, as long as they do not tie names to data they hold about individuals, they do not process any personal data, and that, therefore, data protection law does not apply to them. European Data Protection Authorities, however, take the view that a company processes personal data if it uses data to single out a person, even if it cannot tie a name to these data. This paper argues that data protection law should indeed apply to behavioural targeting. Companies can often tie a name to nameless data about individuals. Furthermore, behavioural targeting relies on collecting information about individuals, singling out individuals, and targeting ads to individuals. Many privacy risks remain, regardless of whether companies tie a name to the information they hold about a person. A name is merely one of the identifiers that can be tied to data about a person, and it is not even the most practical identifier for behavioural targeting. Seeing data used to single out a person as personal data fits the rationale for data protection law: protecting fairness and privacy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4e3b\u5f20\u6570\u636e\u4fdd\u62a4\u6cd5\u5e94\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u884c\u4e3a\u5b9a\u5411\u8425\u9500\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u516c\u53f8\u672a\u5c06\u59d3\u540d\u4e0e\u4e2a\u4eba\u6570\u636e\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u53ea\u8981\u80fd\u591f\u8bc6\u522b\u7279\u5b9a\u4e2a\u4eba\u5c31\u5e94\u89c6\u4e3a\u5904\u7406\u4e2a\u4eba\u6570\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u884c\u4e3a\u5b9a\u5411\u8425\u9500\u516c\u53f8\u58f0\u79f0\u53ea\u8981\u4e0d\u5c06\u59d3\u540d\u4e0e\u4e2a\u4eba\u6570\u636e\u5173\u8054\u5c31\u4e0d\u5904\u7406\u4e2a\u4eba\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u89c4\u907f\u6570\u636e\u4fdd\u62a4\u6cd5\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u8bba\u8bc1\u8fd9\u79cd\u89c2\u70b9\u662f\u9519\u8bef\u7684\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u4fdd\u62a4\u6cd5\u5e94\u5f53\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u884c\u4e3a\u5b9a\u5411\u8425\u9500\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u884c\u4e3a\u5b9a\u5411\u8425\u9500\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u8fd0\u4f5c\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u8bba\u8bc1\u5373\u4f7f\u6ca1\u6709\u59d3\u540d\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u516c\u53f8\u4ecd\u80fd\u8bc6\u522b\u7279\u5b9a\u4e2a\u4eba\uff0c\u4e14\u884c\u4e3a\u5b9a\u5411\u6d89\u53ca\u6536\u96c6\u4e2a\u4eba\u4fe1\u606f\u3001\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2a\u4f53\u548c\u5b9a\u5411\u5e7f\u544a\u7b49\u6838\u5fc3\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u6d3b\u52a8\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\u884c\u4e3a\u5b9a\u5411\u8425\u9500\u786e\u5b9e\u5904\u7406\u4e2a\u4eba\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u59d3\u540d\u53ea\u662f\u4f17\u591a\u6807\u8bc6\u7b26\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u662f\u884c\u4e3a\u5b9a\u5411\u4e2d\u6700\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u6807\u8bc6\u7b26\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6570\u636e\u4fdd\u62a4\u6cd5\u5e94\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u884c\u4e3a\u5b9a\u5411\u8425\u9500\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5176\u6d89\u53ca\u8bc6\u522b\u7279\u5b9a\u4e2a\u4eba\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u6d3b\u52a8\uff0c\u7b26\u5408\u6570\u636e\u4fdd\u62a4\u6cd5\u4fdd\u62a4\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u539f\u7406\u3002"}}

Unlike existing methods that treat control synthesis and topology design separately, we propose a unified approach that simultaneously optimizes both aspects to achieve voltage and frequency regulation and proportional power sharing among distributed generators (DGs). We formulate the closed-loop AC MG as a networked system where DGs, distribution lines, and loads are interconnected subsystems characterized by their dissipative properties. Each DG employs a hierarchical architecture combining local controllers for voltage regulation and distributed controllers for droop-free power sharing through normalized power consensus. By leveraging dissipativity theory, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for subsystem passivity and cast the co-design problem as a convex linear matrix inequality (LMI) optimization, enabling efficient computation and guaranteed stability. Our framework systematically synthesizes sparse communication topologies while handling the coupled dq-frame dynamics and dual power flow objectives inherent to AC MGs. Simulation results on a representative AC MG demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in achieving accurate voltage regulation, frequency synchronization, and proportional power sharing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8017\u6563\u6027\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u62d3\u6251\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ea4\u6d41\u5fae\u7535\u7f51\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u62d3\u6251\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7535\u538b\u9891\u7387\u8c03\u8282\u548c\u6bd4\u4f8b\u529f\u7387\u5206\u914d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u63a7\u5236\u7efc\u5408\u548c\u62d3\u6251\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5206\u5f00\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u4e24\u8005\u7684\u534f\u540c\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u4ea4\u6d41\u5fae\u7535\u7f51\u4e2d\u8026\u5408\u7684dq\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u53cc\u91cd\u529f\u7387\u6d41\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u95ed\u73af\u4ea4\u6d41\u5fae\u7535\u7f51\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u7f51\u7edc\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8017\u6563\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u5efa\u7acb\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e0\u6e90\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5c06\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u51f8LMI\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u7efc\u5408\u7a00\u758f\u901a\u4fe1\u62d3\u6251\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u4ea4\u6d41\u5fae\u7535\u7f51\u4e0a\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u7535\u538b\u8c03\u8282\u3001\u9891\u7387\u540c\u6b65\u548c\u6bd4\u4f8b\u529f\u7387\u5206\u914d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u62d3\u6251\uff0c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4ea4\u6d41\u5fae\u7535\u7f51\u7684\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u6027\u3002"}}

Large language models have become a new tool to help numerical reasoning and understanding these documents.

We introduce a self-improving prompt framework driven by data-augmented optimization. In this closed-loop process, we generate synthetic financial tables and document excerpts, verify their correctness and robustness, and then update the prompt based on the results. Specifically, our framework combines a synthetic data generator with verifiers and a prompt optimizer, where the generator produces new examples that exposes weaknesses in the current prompt, the verifiers check the validity and robustness of the produced examples, and the optimizer incrementally refines the prompt in response. By iterating these steps in a feedback cycle, our method steadily improves prompt accuracy on financial reasoning tasks without needing external labels. Evaluation on DocMath-Eval benchmark demonstrates that our system achieves higher performance in both accuracy and robustness than standard prompt methods, underscoring the value of incorporating synthetic data generation into prompt learning for financial applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u81ea\u6539\u8fdb\u63d0\u793a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u91d1\u878d\u8868\u683c\u548c\u6587\u6863\u7247\u6bb5\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u6839\u636e\u7ed3\u679c\u66f4\u65b0\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\u91d1\u878d\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u91d1\u878d\u6587\u672c\u6216\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8c03\u6574\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u95ee\u9898\u7c7b\u578b\u6216\u6587\u6863\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u9700\u8981\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u63d0\u793a\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u5668\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5668\u4ea7\u751f\u66b4\u9732\u5f53\u524d\u63d0\u793a\u5f31\u70b9\u7684\u793a\u4f8b\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u68c0\u67e5\u751f\u6210\u793a\u4f8b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u6839\u636e\u7ed3\u679c\u9010\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5728DocMath-Eval\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u878d\u5165\u63d0\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u4e8e\u91d1\u878d\u5e94\u7528\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb\u63d0\u793a\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Furthermore, random data missing due to communication failures, congestion, and cyberattacks, makes these methods easily infeasible. Inspired by recent advances in digital twins (DTs), this paper proposes an interactive attention-based DSSE model for robust grid monitoring by integrating three core components: physical entities, virtual modeling, and data fusion. To enable robustness against various data missing in heterogeneous measurements, we first propose physics-informed data augmentation and transfer. Moreover, a state-of-the-art attention-based spatiotemporal feature learning is proposed, followed by a novel cross-interaction feature fusion for robust voltage estimation.

After contextualizing the problem within various control architectures, we dissect the ``curse of simulation'' by analyzing the primary sources of sim-to-real gap: robot dynamics, contact modeling, state estimation, and numerical solvers. Building on this diagnosis, we structure the solutions around two complementary philosophies. The first is to shrink the gap through model-centric strategies that systematically improve the simulator's physical fidelity. The second is to harden the policy, a complementary approach that uses in-simulation robustness training and post-deployment adaptation to make the policy inherently resilient to model inaccuracies.

However, obtaining high-resolution CSI remains challenging in practical wireless communication systems. To address this issue, we propose to utilize Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and score-based generative models to enable robust HBF under imperfect CSI conditions. Firstly, we develop the Hybrid Message Graph Attention Network (HMGAT) which updates both node and edge features through node-level and edge-level message passing. Secondly, we design a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)-based Noise Conditional Score Network (NCSN) to learn the distribution of high-resolution CSI, facilitating CSI generation and data augmentation to further improve HMGAT's performance. Finally, we present a Denoising Score Network (DSN) framework and its instantiation, termed DeBERT, which can denoise imperfect CSI under arbitrary channel error levels, thereby facilitating robust HBF.

Detecting and mitigating hallucinations is challenging when ground-truth references are unavailable and model internals are inaccessible. This paper proposes a novel self-contained low-rank approach to automatically rank multiple candidate captions generated by multiple VLMs based on their hallucination levels, using only the captions themselves without requiring external references or model access. By constructing a sentence-embedding matrix and decomposing it into a low-rank consensus component and a sparse residual, we use the residual magnitude to rank captions: selecting the one with the smallest residual as the most hallucination-free. Experiments on the NuScenes dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves 87% selection accuracy in identifying hallucination-free captions, representing a 19% improvement over the unfiltered baseline and a 6-10% improvement over multi-agent debate method. The sorting produced by sparse error magnitudes shows strong correlation with human judgments of hallucinations, validating our scoring mechanism.

However, the scarcity and imbalance of high fidelity fault data, especially for rare inverter malfunctions and extreme external line faults, limit dependable model training and validation. This paper introduces a unified framework that models a detailed inverter dominated microgrid and systematically generates multiple internal and external fault scenarios to mitigate data scarcity and class imbalance. An enhanced generative model called F2GAN (Feature Feedback GAN) is developed to synthesize high dimensional tabular fault data with improved realism and statistical alignment. Unlike conventional GANs, F2GAN integrates multi level feedback based on mean variance, correlation, and feature matching losses, enabling the generator to refine output distributions toward real fault feature spaces. The generated datasets are evaluated through quantitative and qualitative analyses. Train on Synthetic, Test on Real (TSTR) experiments demonstrate strong generalization of machine learning classifiers trained exclusively on F2GAN samples.

Existing text-based geocoding tools perform poorly in multilingual and unstructured news environments, where incomplete place descriptions and mixed Bangla-English scripts obscure spatial context. To address these limitations, this study introduces ALIGN (Accident Location Inference through Geo-Spatial Neural Reasoning)- a vision-language framework that emulates human spatial reasoning to infer accident coordinates directly from textual and map-based cues. ALIGN integrates large language and vision-language models within a multi-stage pipeline that performs optical character recognition, linguistic reasoning, and map-level verification through grid-based spatial scanning. The framework systematically evaluates each predicted location against contextual and visual evidence, ensuring interpretable, fine-grained geolocation outcomes without requiring model retraining. Applied to Bangla-language news data, ALIGN demonstrates consistent improvements over traditional geoparsing methods, accurately identifying district and sub-district-level crash sites. Beyond its technical contribution, the framework establishes a high accuracy foundation for automated crash mapping in data-scarce regions, supporting evidence-driven road-safety policymaking and the broader integration of multimodal artificial intelligence in transportation analytics.

However, manual tuning of PID parameters for diverse robotic platforms is time-consuming and requires extensive domain expertise. This paper presents a novel hierarchical control framework that combines meta-learning for PID initialization and reinforcement learning (RL) for online adaptation. To address the sample efficiency challenge, a \\textit{physics-based data augmentation} strategy is introduced that generates virtual robot configurations by systematically perturbing physical parameters, enabling effective meta-learning with limited real robot data. The proposed approach is evaluated on two heterogeneous platforms: a 9-DOF Franka Panda manipulator and a 12-DOF Laikago quadruped robot. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves 16.6\\% average improvement on Franka Panda (6.26\u00b0 MAE), with exceptional gains in high-load joints (J2: 80.4\\% improvement from 12.36\u00b0 to 2.42\u00b0). Critically, this work discovers the \\textit{optimization ceiling effect}: RL achieves dramatic improvements when meta-learning exhibits localized high-error joints, but provides no benefit (0.0\\%) when baseline performance is uniformly strong, as observed in Laikago. The method demonstrates robust performance under disturbances (parameter uncertainty: +19.2\\%, no disturbance: +16.6\\%, average: +10.0\\%) with only 10 minutes of training time. Multi-seed analysis across 100 random initializations confirms stable performance (4.81+/-1.64\\% average).

Conventional formulations aggregate multiple motivations into a single objective, implicitly assuming that these motivations are interchangeable. This paper challenges that assumption and proposes an opinion dynamics model grounded in a multi-objective game framework. In the proposed model, each individual experiences two distinct costs: social pressure from disagreement with others and cognitive dissonance from deviation from the perceived truth. Opinion updates are modeled as Pareto improvements between these two costs. This fwork provides a parsimonious explanation for the emergence of pluralistic ignorance, where individuals may agree on something untrue even though they all know the underlying truth. We analytically characterize the model, derive conditions for the emrameergence and prevalence of the truth, and propose an initial-seeding strategy that ensures consensus on truth. Numerical simulations are conducted on how network density and clustering affect the expression of truth. Both theoretical and numerical results lead to clear and non-trivial sociological insights. For example, no network structure guarantees truthful consensus if no one initially express the truth; moderately sparse but well-mixed networks best mitigate pluralistic ignorance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u535a\u5f08\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u610f\u89c1\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u5c06\u591a\u79cd\u52a8\u673a\u805a\u5408\u4e3a\u5355\u4e00\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u8003\u8651\u793e\u4ea4\u538b\u529b\u4e0e\u8ba4\u77e5\u5931\u8c03\u4e24\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u6539\u8fdb\u6765\u89e3\u91ca\u591a\u5143\u65e0\u77e5\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u610f\u89c1\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u5c06\u591a\u79cd\u52a8\u673a\u805a\u5408\u4e3a\u5355\u4e00\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u9690\u542b\u5047\u8bbe\u8fd9\u4e9b\u52a8\u673a\u53ef\u4e92\u6362\u3002\u672c\u6587\u6311\u6218\u8fd9\u4e00\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u8ba4\u4e3a\u793e\u4ea4\u538b\u529b\u4e0e\u8ba4\u77e5\u5931\u8c03\u662f\u4e24\u79cd\u72ec\u7acb\u52a8\u673a\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5206\u522b\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "method": "\u5efa\u7acb\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u535a\u5f08\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4e2a\u4f53\u9762\u4e34\u4e24\u4e2a\u6210\u672c\uff1a\u4e0e\u4ed6\u4eba\u610f\u89c1\u5206\u6b67\u7684\u793e\u4ea4\u538b\u529b\u3001\u4e0e\u611f\u77e5\u771f\u76f8\u504f\u79bb\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u5931\u8c03\u3002\u610f\u89c1\u66f4\u65b0\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u6210\u672c\u95f4\u7684\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u6539\u8fdb\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u89e3\u91ca\u591a\u5143\u65e0\u77e5\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u771f\u76f8\u51fa\u73b0\u548c\u6d41\u884c\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u786e\u4fdd\u771f\u76f8\u5171\u8bc6\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u64ad\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u663e\u793a\u7f51\u7edc\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u805a\u7c7b\u5bf9\u771f\u76f8\u8868\u8fbe\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6ca1\u6709\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u771f\u76f8\u5171\u8bc6\u5982\u679c\u65e0\u4eba\u521d\u59cb\u8868\u8fbe\u771f\u76f8\uff1b\u9002\u5ea6\u7a00\u758f\u4f46\u5145\u5206\u6df7\u5408\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u6700\u80fd\u7f13\u89e3\u591a\u5143\u65e0\u77e5\u73b0\u8c61\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u679c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6e05\u6670\u4e14\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u5b66\u6d1e\u89c1\u3002"}}

Whether a legged robot making-and-breaking contact with a floor, or a manipulator grasping objects, contact is everywhere. Unfortunately, the switching of dynamics at contact boundaries makes control difficult. Predictive controllers face non-convex optimization problems when contact is involved. Here, we overcome this difficulty by applying Koopman operators to subsume the segmented dynamics due to contact changes into a unified, globally-linear model in an embedding space. We show that viscoelastic contact at robot-environment interactions underpins the use of Koopman operators without approximation to control inputs. This methodology enables the convex Model Predictive Control of a legged robot, and the real-time control of a manipulator engaged in dynamic pushing. In this work, we show that our method allows robots to discover elaborate control strategies in real-time over time horizons with multiple contact changes, and the method is applicable to broad fields beyond robotics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f7f\u7528Koopman\u7b97\u5b50\u5c06\u63a5\u89e6\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5168\u5c40\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u63a5\u89e6\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u51f8\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u52a8\u6001\u63a5\u89e6\u65f6\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u63a5\u89e6\u8fb9\u754c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5207\u6362\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u975e\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5e94\u7528Koopman\u7b97\u5b50\u5c06\u5206\u6bb5\u63a5\u89e6\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7edf\u4e00\u4e3a\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7c98\u5f39\u6027\u63a5\u89e6\u7279\u6027\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u8f93\u5165\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u817f\u5f0f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u51f8\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u52a8\u6001\u63a8\u52a8\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u53d1\u73b0\u5305\u542b\u591a\u6b21\u63a5\u89e6\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u590d\u6742\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u9700\u8981\u5904\u7406\u63a5\u89e6\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Twelve ML models, including ensemble algorithms and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP), were trained on labeled time-domain measurements and evaluated in a real-time streaming environment designed for sub-cycle responsiveness. The architecture incorporates a cycle-length smoothing filter and confidence threshold to stabilize decisions. Results show that while several models achieved near-perfect offline accuracies (up to 99.9%), only the MLP sustained robust coverage (98-99%) under streaming, whereas ensembles preserved perfect anomaly precision but abstained frequently (10-49% coverage).

Recent methods have further improved LLM performance in complex mathematical reasoning. However, when extending these methods beyond the domain of mathematical reasoning to tasks involving complex domain-specific knowledge, we observe a consistent failure of LLMs to generate novel insights during the reflection stage. Instead of conducting genuine cognitive refinement, the model tends to mechanically reiterate earlier reasoning steps without introducing new information or perspectives, a phenomenon referred to as \"Echo Reflection\". We attribute this behavior to two key defects: (1) Uncontrollable information flow during response generation, which allows premature intermediate thoughts to propagate unchecked and distort final decisions; (2) Insufficient exploration of internal knowledge during reflection, leading to repeating earlier findings rather than generating new cognitive insights. Building on these findings, we proposed a novel reinforcement learning method termed Adaptive Entropy Policy Optimization (AEPO). Specifically, the AEPO framework consists of two major components: (1) Reflection-aware Information Filtration, which quantifies the cognitive information flow and prevents the final answer from being affected by earlier bad cognitive information; (2) Adaptive-Entropy Optimization, which dynamically balances exploration and exploitation across different reasoning stages, promoting both reflective diversity and answer correctness.

However, their reliability remains a challenge, especially in long-horizon tasks, since they often produce overconfident yet wrong outputs. Conformal Prediction (CP) has been leveraged to address this issue by wrapping LLM outputs into prediction sets that contain the correct action with a user-defined confidence. When the prediction set is a singleton, the planner executes that action; otherwise, it requests help from a user. This has led to LLM-based planners that can ensure plan correctness with a user-defined probability. However, as LLMs are trained in an uncertainty-agnostic manner, without awareness of prediction sets, they tend to produce unnecessarily large sets, particularly at higher confidence levels, resulting in frequent human interventions limiting autonomous deployment. To address this, we introduce CoFineLLM (Conformal Finetuning for LLMs), the first CP-aware finetuning framework for LLM-based planners that explicitly reduces prediction-set size and, in turn, the need for user interventions. We evaluate our approach on multiple language-instructed robot planning problems and show consistent improvements over uncertainty-aware and uncertainty-agnostic finetuning baselines in terms of prediction-set size, and help rates.

We propose a cost-efficient multi-agent judging framework that employs Small Language Models (SLMs) through structured debates among critic, defender, and judge agents. To rigorously assess safety judgments, we construct HAJailBench, a large-scale human-annotated jailbreak benchmark comprising 12,000 adversarial interactions across diverse attack methods and target models. The dataset provides fine-grained, expert-labeled ground truth for evaluating both safety robustness and judge reliability.

However, while the discrete-token CoT reasoning pattern can be reinforced through policy optimization algorithms such as group relative policy optimization (GRPO), extending the soft-thinking pattern with Reinforcement Learning (RL) remains challenging. This difficulty stems from the complexities of injecting stochasticity into soft-thinking tokens and updating soft-thinking policies accordingly. As a result, previous attempts to combine soft-thinking with GRPO typically underperform their discrete-token GRPO counterparts. To fully unlock the potential of soft-thinking, this paper presents a novel policy optimization algorithm, SofT-GRPO, to reinforce LLMs under the soft-thinking reasoning pattern. SofT-GRPO injects the Gumbel noise into logits, employs the Gumbel-Softmax technique to avoid soft-thinking tokens outside the pre-trained embedding space, and leverages the reparameterization trick in policy gradient. We conduct experiments across base LLMs ranging from 1.5B to 7B parameters, and results demonstrate that SofT-GRPO enables soft-thinking LLMs to slightly outperform discrete-token GRPO on Pass@1 (+0.13% on average accuracy), while exhibiting a substantial uplift on Pass@32 (+2.19% on average accuracy).

To achieve this, a pervasive paradigm is to leverage the rich vision-semantic priors of large vision-language models (VLMs). However, the fundamental question persists: How do VLAs effectively inherit the prior knowledge from VLMs? To address this critical question, we introduce a diagnostic benchmark, GrinningFace, an emoji tabletop manipulation task where the robot arm is asked to place objects onto printed emojis corresponding to language instructions. This task design is particularly revealing -- knowledge associated with emojis is ubiquitous in Internet-scale datasets used for VLM pre-training, yet emojis themselves are largely absent from standard robotics datasets. Consequently, they provide a clean proxy: successful task completion indicates effective transfer of VLM priors to embodied control.

However, acquiring GUI data remains a significant challenge. Existing methods often involve designing automated agents that browse URLs from the Common Crawl, using webpage HTML to collect screenshots and corresponding annotations, including the names and bounding boxes of UI elements. However, this method is difficult to apply to desktop software or some newly launched websites not included in the Common Crawl. While we expect the model to possess strong generalization capabilities to handle this, it is still crucial for personalized scenarios that require rapid and perfect adaptation to new software or websites. To address this, we propose an automated data collection method with minimal annotation costs, named Auto-Explorer. It incorporates a simple yet effective exploration mechanism that autonomously parses and explores GUI environments, gathering data efficiently. Additionally, to assess the quality of exploration, we have developed the UIXplore benchmark. This benchmark creates environments for explorer agents to discover and save software states. Using the data gathered, we fine-tune a multimodal large language model (MLLM) and establish a GUI element grounding testing set to evaluate the effectiveness of the exploration strategies.

In contrast, soft robotic simulation frameworks remain scarce and are seldom adopted by the soft robotics community. This gap stems partly from the lack of easy-to-use, general-purpose frameworks and partly from the high computational cost of accurately simulating continuum mechanics, which often renders policy learning infeasible. In this work, we demonstrate that rapid soft robot policy learning is indeed achievable via implicit time-stepping. Our simulator of choice, DisMech, is a general-purpose, fully implicit soft-body simulator capable of handling both soft dynamics and frictional contact. We further introduce delta natural curvature control, a method analogous to delta joint position control in rigid manipulators, providing an intuitive and effective means of enacting control for soft robot learning. To highlight the benefits of implicit time-stepping and delta curvature control, we conduct extensive comparisons across four diverse soft manipulator tasks against one of the most widely used soft-body frameworks, Elastica. With implicit time-stepping, parallel stepping of 500 environments achieves up to 6x faster speeds for non-contact cases and up to 40x faster for contact-rich scenarios. Finally, a comprehensive sim-to-sim gap evaluation--training policies in one simulator and evaluating them in another--demonstrates that implicit time-stepping provides a rare free lunch: dramatic speedups achieved without sacrificing accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u9690\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u8fdb\u5b9e\u73b0\u8f6f\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5feb\u901f\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528DisMech\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u7ed3\u5408delta\u81ea\u7136\u66f2\u7387\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u8f6f\u4f53\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u76f8\u6bd4Elastica\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e866-40\u500d\u7684\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u8f6f\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6a21\u62df\u6846\u67b6\u7a00\u7f3a\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u56f0\u96be\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8f6f\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528DisMech\u9690\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u8fdb\u8f6f\u4f53\u6a21\u62df\u5668\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u65b0\u63d0\u51fa\u7684delta\u81ea\u7136\u66f2\u7387\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728500\u4e2a\u5e76\u884c\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u9690\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u8fdb\u5728\u975e\u63a5\u89e6\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b06\u500d\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u5728\u63a5\u89e6\u4e30\u5bcc\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b040\u500d\u52a0\u901f\u3002sim-to-sim\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u52a0\u901f\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9690\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u8fdb\u4e3a\u8f6f\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7f55\u89c1\u7684\u514d\u8d39\u5348\u9910\uff1a\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u800c\u4e0d\u635f\u5931\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002"}}

Toward this, a distributed observable state-space model is derived, which paves the way for estimation and observability analysis of HDVs in mixed traffic scenarios. In this direction, first, we obtain the condition on the network topology to satisfy the distributed observability, i.e., the condition such that each HDV state is observable to every CAV via information-exchange over the network. It is shown that strong connectivity of the network, along with the proper design of the observer gain, is sufficient for this. A distributed observer is then designed by locally sharing estimates/observations of each CAV with its neighborhood. Second, in case there exist faulty sensors or unreliable observation data, we derive the condition for redundant distributed observability as a $q$-node/link-connected network design. This redundancy is achieved by extra information-sharing over the network and implies that a certain number of faulty sensors and unreliable links can be isolated/removed without losing the observability.

This behavior undermines model reliability and poses societal risks. Mitigating LRM sycophancy requires monitoring how this sycophancy emerges during the reasoning trajectory; however, current methods mainly focus on judging based on final answers and correcting them, without understanding how sycophancy develops during reasoning processes. To address this limitation, we propose MONICA, a novel Monitor-guided Calibration framework that monitors and mitigates sycophancy during model inference at the level of reasoning steps, without requiring the model to finish generating its complete answer. MONICA integrates a sycophantic monitor that provides real-time monitoring of sycophantic drift scores during response generation with a calibrator that dynamically suppresses sycophantic behavior when scores exceed predefined thresholds.

We introduce a parametric geometry generator to customise actuator models from high-level inputs, and explore the new design space through semi-automated experimentation and systematic exploration of key parameters. Using it we characterise the actuators' extension/bending, expansion, and stiffness and reveal clear relationships between key design parameters and performance.

The reliable operation of Li-ion batteries depends critically on the accurate estimation of battery capacity. However, conventional estimation methods require extensive training datasets from costly battery tests for modeling, and a full cycle of charge and discharge is often needed to estimate the capacity. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel capacity estimation method that leverages only one cycle of the open-circuit voltage (OCV) test in modeling and allows for estimating the capacity from partial charge or discharge data. Moreover, by applying it with OCV identification algorithms, we can estimate the capacity from dynamic discharge data without requiring dedicated data collection tests. We observed an invariance property in the OCV versus state of charge relationship across aging cycles. Leveraging this invariance, the proposed method estimates the capacity by solving an OCV alignment problem using only the OCV and the discharge capacity data from the battery.

EDTR achieves 41\\% better calibration than competing methods with an average ECE of 0.287 and the best overall composite score of 0.672, while notably achieving perfect accuracy on AIME and exceptional calibration on GSM8K with an ECE of 0.107, domains where baselines exhibit severe overconfidence. Our work provides a geometric framework for understanding and quantifying uncertainty in multi-step LLM reasoning, enabling more reliable deployment where calibrated confidence estimates are essential.", "AI": {"tldr": "EDTR\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u62d3\u6251\u5206\u6790\u548c\u57fa\u4e8eDirichlet\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u5728\u5411\u91cf\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1LLM\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728LLM\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u6821\u51c6\u5dee\u548c\u8fc7\u5ea6\u81ea\u4fe1\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9519\u8bef\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e25\u91cd\u8fc7\u5ea6\u81ea\u4fe1\uff0c\u8fd9\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u89c6\u4e3a\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u516b\u4e2a\u62d3\u6251\u98ce\u9669\u7279\u5f81\u6765\u6355\u6349\u63a8\u7406\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff1a\u7d27\u5bc6\u3001\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u8868\u793a\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u800c\u5206\u6563\u3001\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u8868\u793a\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cEDTR\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6821\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u6821\u51c6\u6548\u679c\u63d0\u534741%\uff0c\u5e73\u5747ECE\u4e3a0.287\uff0c\u603b\u4f53\u7efc\u5408\u5f97\u52060.672\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u5728AIME\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u5b8c\u7f8e\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5728GSM8K\u4e0aECE\u4e3a0.107\uff0c\u800c\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9886\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e25\u91cd\u8fc7\u5ea6\u81ea\u4fe1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u51e0\u4f55\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u591a\u6b65LLM\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u9700\u8981\u6821\u51c6\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u3002"}}

However, a central challenge is the goal setting problem: robots must propose feasible and diverse goals that are achievable in their current environment. Existing methods like RIG (Visual Reinforcement Learning with Imagined Goals) use variational autoencoder (VAE) to generate goals in a learned latent space but have the limitation of producing physically implausible goals that hinder learning efficiency. We propose Physics-Informed RIG (PI-RIG), which integrates physical constraints directly into the VAE training process through a novel Enhanced Physics-Informed Variational Autoencoder (Enhanced p3-VAE), enabling the generation of physically consistent and achievable goals. Our key innovation is the explicit separation of the latent space into physics variables governing object dynamics and environmental factors capturing visual appearance, while enforcing physical consistency through differential equation constraints and conservation laws. This enables the generation of physically consistent and achievable goals that respect fundamental physical principles such as object permanence, collision constraints, and dynamic feasibility. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that this physics-informed goal generation significantly improves the quality of proposed goals, leading to more effective exploration and better skill acquisition in visual robotic manipulation tasks including reaching, pushing, and pick-and-place scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86PI-RIG\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5c06\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u76f4\u63a5\u6574\u5408\u5230VAE\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u53ef\u8fbe\u7684\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u76ee\u6807\u6761\u4ef6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u8bbe\u7f6e\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982RIG\u4f7f\u7528VAE\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u7269\u7406\u4e0a\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\u3002\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u76ee\u6807\u8bbe\u7f6e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8ba9\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u51fa\u5728\u5f53\u524d\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u591a\u6837\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "method": "PI-RIG\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08Enhanced p3-VAE\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u663e\u5f0f\u5206\u79bb\u4e3a\u63a7\u5236\u7269\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u7269\u7406\u53d8\u91cf\u548c\u6355\u6349\u89c6\u89c9\u5916\u89c2\u7684\u73af\u5883\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u5b88\u6052\u5b9a\u5f8b\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u76ee\u6807\u751f\u6210\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u5230\u8fbe\u3001\u63a8\u52a8\u548c\u6293\u53d6\u653e\u7f6e\u573a\u666f\uff09\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6280\u80fd\u83b7\u53d6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u76f4\u63a5\u6574\u5408\u5230\u76ee\u6807\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u80fd\u591f\u4ea7\u751f\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u53ef\u8fbe\u7684\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u76ee\u6807\u6761\u4ef6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

This thesis explores the direction of enhancing agents' zero-shot systematic generalization abilities by granting RL agents reasoning behaviors that are found to help systematic generalization in the human brain. Inspired by human conscious planning behaviors, we first introduced a top-down attention mechanism, which allows a decision-time planning agent to dynamically focus its reasoning on the most relevant aspects of the environmental state given its instantaneous intentions, a process we call \"spatial abstraction\". This approach significantly improves systematic generalization outside the training tasks. Subsequently, building on spatial abstraction, we developed the Skipper framework to automatically decompose complex tasks into simpler, more manageable sub-tasks. Skipper provides robustness against distributional shifts and efficacy in long-term, compositional planning by focusing on pertinent spatial and temporal elements of the environment. Finally, we identified a common failure mode and safety risk in planning agents that rely on generative models to generate state targets during planning. It is revealed that most agents blindly trust the targets they hallucinate, resulting in delusional planning behaviors. Inspired by how the human brain rejects delusional intentions, we propose learning a feasibility evaluator to enable rejecting hallucinated infeasible targets, which led to significant performance improvements in various kinds of planning agents. Finally, we suggest directions for future research, aimed at achieving general task abstraction and fully enabling abstract planning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u62bd\u8c61\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u73af\u5883\u3002\u53d7\u4eba\u7c7b\u610f\u8bc6\u89c4\u5212\u884c\u4e3a\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u8d4b\u4e88\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4eba\u8111\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6cdb\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "1. \u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u4e0a\u800c\u4e0b\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a7a\u95f4\u62bd\u8c61\uff1b2. \u5f00\u53d1Skipper\u6846\u67b6\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u89e3\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\uff1b3. \u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\u62d2\u7edd\u5e7b\u89c9\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u5984\u60f3\u89c4\u5212\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u7a7a\u95f4\u62bd\u8c61\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u4efb\u52a1\u5916\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff1bSkipper\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u548c\u957f\u671f\u7ec4\u5408\u89c4\u5212\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff1b\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5404\u7c7b\u89c4\u5212\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7a7a\u95f4\u62bd\u8c61\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u901a\u7528\u4efb\u52a1\u62bd\u8c61\u548c\u5b8c\u5168\u62bd\u8c61\u89c4\u5212\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Accepted by IROS 2025", "summary": "Efficient, accurate, and flexible relative localization is crucial in air-ground collaborative tasks. However, current approaches for robot relative localization are primarily realized in the form of distributed multi-robot SLAM systems with the same sensor configuration, which are tightly coupled with the state estimation of all robots, limiting both flexibility and accuracy. To this end, we fully leverage the high capacity of Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) to integrate multiple sensors, enabling a semi-distributed cross-modal air-ground relative localization framework. In this work, both the UGV and the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) independently perform SLAM while extracting deep learning-based keypoints and global descriptors, which decouples the relative localization from the state estimation of all agents. The UGV employs a local Bundle Adjustment (BA) with LiDAR, camera, and an IMU to rapidly obtain accurate relative pose estimates. The BA process adopts sparse keypoint optimization and is divided into two stages: First, optimizing camera poses interpolated from LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO), followed by estimating the relative camera poses between the UGV and UAV. Additionally, we implement an incremental loop closure detection algorithm using deep learning-based descriptors to maintain and retrieve keyframes efficiently. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves outstanding performance in both accuracy and efficiency. Unlike traditional multi-robot SLAM approaches that transmit images or point clouds, our method only transmits keypoint pixels and their descriptors, effectively constraining the communication bandwidth under 0.3 Mbps.

Furthermore, the conventional solution, which consists of decomposing signals using Fourier series and applying superposition, is a fragmented process that does not provide a unified solution in the frequency domain. This paper overcomes this limitation by introducing a complete and direct approach for multi-harmonic AC circuits using Geometric Algebra (GA). In this way, all non-sinusoidal voltage and current waveforms are represented as simple vectors in a $2N$-dimensional Euclidean space. The relationship between these vectors is characterized by a single and unified geometric transformation termed the \\textit{rotoflex}. This operator elevates the concept of impedance from a set of complex numbers per frequency to a single multivector that holistically captures the circuit response, while unifying the magnitude scale (flextance) and phase rotation (rotance) across all harmonics. Thus, this work establishes GA as a structurally unified and efficient alternative to phasor analysis, providing a more rigorous foundation for electrical circuit analysis. The methodology is validated through case studies that demonstrate perfect numerical consistency with traditional methods and superior performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u51e0\u4f55\u4ee3\u6570(GA)\u7684\u591a\u8c10\u6ce2\u4ea4\u6d41\u7535\u8def\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u76f8\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u4ec5\u9650\u4e8e\u5355\u9891\u6b63\u5f26\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u76f8\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u4ec5\u9650\u4e8e\u5355\u9891\u6b63\u5f26\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u8c10\u6ce2\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u53e0\u52a0\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u788e\u7247\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u9891\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u7edf\u4e00\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u51e0\u4f55\u4ee3\u6570(GA)\u6784\u5efa\u5b8c\u6574\u76f4\u63a5\u7684\u591a\u8c10\u6ce2\u4ea4\u6d41\u7535\u8def\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u6240\u6709\u975e\u6b63\u5f26\u7535\u538b\u548c\u7535\u6d41\u6ce2\u5f62\u8868\u793a\u4e3a2N\u7ef4\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u4e00\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u53d8\u6362\u7b97\u5b50\"rotoflex\"\u6765\u63cf\u8ff0\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5411\u91cf\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u963b\u6297\u6982\u5ff5\u4ece\u6bcf\u9891\u7387\u7684\u590d\u6570\u96c6\u5408\u63d0\u5347\u4e3a\u5355\u4e00\u591a\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u6355\u6349\u7535\u8def\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7edf\u4e00\u6240\u6709\u8c10\u6ce2\u7684\u5e45\u5ea6\u7f29\u653e(flextance)\u548c\u76f8\u4f4d\u65cb\u8f6c(rotance)\u3002", "conclusion": "\u51e0\u4f55\u4ee3\u6570\u4f5c\u4e3a\u76f8\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u7edf\u4e00\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4e3a\u7535\u8def\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u4e25\u8c28\u7684\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5b8c\u7f8e\u6570\u503c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

We introduce GHOST, a hierarchical framework that optimally solves the GCS-TSP by combining combinatorial tour search with convex trajectory optimization. GHOST systematically explores tours on a complete graph induced by the GCS, using a novel abstract-path-unfolding algorithm to compute admissible lower bounds that guide best-first search at both the high level (over tours) and the low level (over feasible GCS paths realizing the tour). These bounds provide strong pruning power, enabling efficient search while avoiding unnecessary convex optimization calls.

Most existing robotic multitask models rely on dense embeddings that entangle both object and background cues, raising concerns about both efficiency and interpretability. In contrast, we study object-relation-centric representations as a pathway to more structured, efficient, and explainable visuomotor control. Our contributions are two-fold. First, we introduce LIBERO+, a fine-grained benchmark dataset designed to enable and evaluate object-relation reasoning in robotic manipulation. Unlike prior datasets, LIBERO+ provides object-centric annotations that enrich demonstrations with box- and mask-level labels as well as instance-level temporal tracking, supporting compact and interpretable visuomotor representations. Second, we propose SlotVLA, a slot-attention-based framework that captures both objects and their relations for action decoding. It uses a slot-based visual tokenizer to maintain consistent temporal object representations, a relation-centric decoder to produce task-relevant embeddings, and an LLM-driven module that translates these embeddings into executable actions. Experiments on LIBERO+ demonstrate that object-centric slot and object-relation slot representations drastically reduce the number of required visual tokens, while providing competitive generalization.

DC microgrids have gained prominence due to their reduced conversion losses, simplified interfacing with DC-based RESs, and improved reliability. To manage the inherent variability of RESs and ensure stable operation, energy management systems (EMS) have become essential. While various EMS algorithms have been proposed and validated using real-time simulation platforms, most assume ideal communication conditions or rely on simplified network models, overlooking the impact of realistic communication delays on EMS performance. This paper presents a novel real-time cyber-physical system (CPS) testbed for evaluating EMS performance in DC microgrids under realistic communication delays. The proposed testbed integrates a DC microgrid modeled in OPAL-RT with an EMS controller implemented on a Raspberry Pi (RPi). The communication network is emulated using EXataCPS, enabling the exchange of actual power system traffic and the replication of realistic latency conditions.

Peak torque or speed specifications tell us little about whether a joint can deliver the right combination of torque, power, and endurance at task-relevant postures and rates. We introduce a comprehensive framework that makes ``human-level'' measurable and comparable across systems. Our approach has three components. First, a kinematic \\emph{DoF atlas} standardizes joint coordinate systems and ranges of motion using ISB-based conventions, ensuring that human and robot joints are compared in the same reference frames. Second, \\emph{Human-Equivalence Envelopes (HEE)} define per-joint requirements by measuring whether a robot meets human torque \\emph{and} power simultaneously at the same joint angle and rate $(q,\u03c9)$, weighted by positive mechanical work in task-specific bands (walking, stairs, lifting, reaching, and hand actions). Third, the \\emph{Human-Level Actuation Score (HLAS)} aggregates six physically grounded factors: workspace coverage (ROM and DoF), HEE coverage, torque-mode bandwidth, efficiency, and thermal sustainability.

In particular, we are interested in the structural sign (SS) herdability of a system wherein the underlying digraph representing it is signed. Structural herdability finds applications in various domains like power networks, biological networks, opinion dynamics, multi-robot shepherding, etc. We begin the analysis by introducing a layered graph representation Gs of the signed digraph G; such a representation allows us to capture the signed distances between the nodes with ease. We construct a subgraph of G_s that characterizes paths of identical signs between layers and uniform path lengths, referred to as a layer-wise unisigned graph LUG(G_s). A special subgraph of an LUG(G_s), denoted as an LUG^H(G_s), is key to achieving SS herdability. This is because we prove that an LTI system is SS herdable if and only if there exists an LUG^H(G_s) which covers all the nodes of the given digraph. To the best of our knowledge, such a graphical test is one of the first methods which allows us to check SS herdability for arbitrary digraph topologies. Interestingly, the analysis also reveals that a system can be SS herdable even in the presence of (signed and layer) dilation in the associated digraph (note that such a behaviour has been shown to be impossible in directed trees). Additionally, we also extend these results to digraphs with multiple leader and driver nodes. In order to illustrate all the results, we present numerous examples throughout the paper.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u4e0d\u53d8\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u7267\u7fa4\u6027\u56fe\u8bba\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u5c42\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u548c\u5c42\u95f4\u540c\u53f7\u56fe\u7684\u56fe\u5f62\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u68c0\u67e5\u4efb\u610f\u6709\u5411\u56fe\u62d3\u6251\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u7ed3\u6784\u7267\u7fa4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u7b26\u53f7\u7ed3\u6784\u7267\u7fa4\u6027\u5728\u56fe\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u7535\u529b\u7f51\u7edc\u3001\u751f\u7269\u7f51\u7edc\u3001\u610f\u89c1\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7267\u7fa4\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u6709\u5411\u56fe\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u56fe\u8868\u793aGs\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5c42\u95f4\u540c\u53f7\u56feLUG(Gs)\u53ca\u5176\u7279\u6b8a\u5b50\u56feLUG^H(Gs)\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u7cfb\u7edf\u7b26\u53f7\u7ed3\u6784\u7267\u7fa4\u6027\u7b49\u4ef7\u4e8e\u5b58\u5728\u8986\u76d6\u6240\u6709\u8282\u70b9\u7684LUG^H(Gs)\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u80fd\u591f\u68c0\u67e5\u4efb\u610f\u6709\u5411\u56fe\u62d3\u6251\u7b26\u53f7\u7ed3\u6784\u7267\u7fa4\u6027\u7684\u56fe\u5f62\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5728\u6709\u5411\u56fe\u4e2d\u5373\u4f7f\u5b58\u5728\u7b26\u53f7\u548c\u5c42\u6269\u5f20\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ecd\u53ef\u80fd\u5177\u6709\u7267\u7fa4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u56fe\u8bba\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u5206\u6790\u7b26\u53f7\u7ed3\u6784\u7267\u7fa4\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u7ed3\u679c\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u591a\u9886\u5bfc\u8282\u70b9\u548c\u9a71\u52a8\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u6709\u5411\u56fe\u3002"}}

Traditional navigation systems rely on expensive LiDARs that, while geometrically precise, are seman- tically unaware, they cannot distinguish a important document on an office floor from a harmless piece of litter, treating both as physically traversable. While advanced semantic segmentation exists, no prior work has successfully integrated this visual intelligence into a real-time path planner that is efficient enough for low-cost, embedded hardware. This paper presents a frame- work to bridge this gap, delivering context-aware navigation on an affordable robotic platform. Our approach centers on a novel, tight integration of a lightweight perception module with an online A* planner. The perception system employs a semantic segmentation model to identify user-defined visual constraints, enabling the robot to navigate based on contextual importance rather than physical size alone. This adaptability allows an operator to define what is critical for a given task, be it sensitive papers in an office or safety lines in a factory, thus resolving the ambiguity of what to avoid. This semantic perception is seamlessly fused with geometric data. The identified visual constraints are projected as non-geometric obstacles onto a global map that is continuously updated from sensor data, enabling robust navigation through both partially known and unknown environments. We validate our framework through extensive experiments in high-fidelity simulations and on a real-world robotic platform. The results demonstrate robust, real-time performance, proving that a cost- effective robot can safely navigate complex environments while respecting critical visual cues invisible to traditional planners.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u5b9e\u65f6\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u5bfc\u822a\uff0c\u533a\u5206\u91cd\u8981\u7269\u54c1\u4e0e\u666e\u901a\u969c\u788d\u7269\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5bfc\u822a\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f9d\u8d56\u6602\u8d35\u7684LiDAR\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u51e0\u4f55\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9ad8\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u91cd\u8981\u6587\u4ef6\u4e0e\u666e\u901a\u5783\u573e\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u81ea\u4e3b\u670d\u52a1\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u4eba\u7c7b\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u8bc6\u522b\u7528\u6237\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u975e\u51e0\u4f55\u969c\u788d\u7269\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u5168\u5c40\u5730\u56fe\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u5728\u7ebfA*\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u7d27\u5bc6\u96c6\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5e73\u53f0\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5b89\u5168\u5bfc\u822a\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u5e76\u5c0a\u91cd\u4f20\u7edf\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u65e0\u6cd5\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u5173\u952e\u89c6\u89c9\u7ebf\u7d22\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u5b9e\u65f6\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u5bfc\u822a\u3002"}}

The model accounts for IT workload shifting, UPS energy storage, and cooling system. Motivated by the need to alleviate the increasing strain on power systems while leveraging their untapped flexibility potential, this study makes two primary contributions: (i) an operational optimisation model that integrates IT scheduling, UPS operation, and cooling dynamics to establish a cost optimal baseline operation, and (ii) a duration-aware flexibility assessment that, for any given start time and power deviation, computes the maximum feasible duration from this baseline while respecting all operational, thermal, and recovery constraints. This method characterises the aggregate flexibility envelope. Results reveal a clear temporal structure and a notable asymmetry in flexibility provision: upward flexibility (electricity load reduction) is driven by deferring IT workload, which allows for a secondary reduction in cooling power. Downward flexibility (electricity load increase) relies on increasing power consumption of the cooling system, supported by the TES buffer, and charging the UPS. This framework translates abstract flexibility potential into quantified flexibility magnitude and duration that system operators could investigate for use in services such as reserve, frequency response, and price responsive demand.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6574\u4f53\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5bf9\u7535\u7f51\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u5305\u62ecIT\u8d1f\u8f7d\u8f6c\u79fb\u3001UPS\u50a8\u80fd\u548c\u51b7\u5374\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f20\u7edf\u88ab\u52a8\u7535\u529b\u8d1f\u8f7d\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u6210\u4e3a\u7535\u7f51\u4e3b\u52a8\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002\u4e3a\u7f13\u89e3\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u538b\u529b\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u672a\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u91cf\u5316\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u96c6\u6210IT\u8c03\u5ea6\u3001UPS\u8fd0\u884c\u548c\u51b7\u5374\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u8fd0\u8425\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u6210\u672c\u6700\u4f18\u57fa\u51c6\u8fd0\u884c\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4ece\u57fa\u51c6\u8fd0\u884c\u7684\u6700\u5927\u53ef\u884c\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u5177\u6709\u660e\u663e\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u663e\u8457\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff1a\u5411\u4e0a\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff08\u7535\u529b\u8d1f\u8f7d\u51cf\u5c11\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u63a8\u8fdfIT\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u5411\u4e0b\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff08\u7535\u529b\u8d1f\u8f7d\u589e\u52a0\uff09\u4f9d\u8d56\u51b7\u5374\u7cfb\u7edf\u529f\u8017\u589e\u52a0\u548cUPS\u5145\u7535\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u62bd\u8c61\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u6f5c\u529b\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\u53ef\u5c06\u5176\u7528\u4e8e\u50a8\u5907\u3001\u9891\u7387\u54cd\u5e94\u548c\u4ef7\u683c\u54cd\u5e94\u9700\u6c42\u7b49\u670d\u52a1\u3002"}}

Previous work has attempted to catch these unsafe instances by interrogating models directly about their objectives and behaviors. However, the main weakness of trusting interrogations is that models can lie. We propose self-report fine-tuning (SRFT), a simple supervised fine-tuning technique that trains models to admit their factual mistakes when asked. We show that the admission of factual errors in simple question-answering settings generalizes out-of-distribution (OOD) to the admission of hidden misaligned objectives in adversarial agentic settings. We evaluate SRFT in OOD stealth tasks, where models are instructed to complete a hidden misaligned objective alongside a user-specified objective without being caught by monitoring. After SRFT, models are more likely to confess the details of their hidden objectives when interrogated, even under strong pressure not to disclose them. Interrogation on SRFT models can detect hidden objectives with near-ceiling performance (F1 score = 0.98), while the baseline model lies when interrogated under the same conditions (F1 score = 0). Interrogation on SRFT models can further elicit the content of the hidden objective, recovering 28-100% details, compared to 0% details recovered in the baseline model and by prefilled assistant turn attacks. This provides a promising technique for promoting honesty propensity and incriminating misaligned AI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u62a5\u544a\u5fae\u8c03(SRFT)\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u627f\u8ba4\u4e8b\u5b9e\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u4ee3\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u66f4\u53ef\u80fd\u5766\u767d\u9690\u85cf\u7684\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u6267\u884c\u590d\u6742\u4ee3\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u4e5f\u66f4\u53ef\u80fd\u8ffd\u6c42\u4e0d\u826f\u76ee\u6807\u5e76\u9020\u6210\u4f24\u5bb3\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u8be2\u95ee\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4f46\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u8bf4\u8c0e\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u62a5\u544a\u5fae\u8c03(SRFT)\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u88ab\u8be2\u95ee\u65f6\u627f\u8ba4\u4e8b\u5b9e\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7b80\u5355\u95ee\u7b54\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3\u627f\u8ba4\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u4ee3\u7406\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u5728OOD\u9690\u853d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cSRFT\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u8be2\u95ee\u65f6\u5766\u767d\u9690\u85cf\u76ee\u6807\u7ec6\u8282(F1\u5206\u6570=0.98)\uff0c\u800c\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4f1a\u8bf4\u8c0e(F1\u5206\u6570=0)\u3002SRFT\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u6062\u590d28-100%\u7684\u9690\u85cf\u76ee\u6807\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u800c\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u9884\u586b\u5145\u52a9\u624b\u8f6e\u653b\u51fb\u53ea\u80fd\u6062\u590d0%\u3002", "conclusion": "SRFT\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u80fd\u4fc3\u8fdbAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8bda\u5b9e\u503e\u5411\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

These scenarios exhibit non-Gaussian, non-stationary channels with heavy-tailed fading and abrupt signal fluctuations. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel wireless channel model based on symmetric $\u03b1$-stable L\u00e9vy processes, thereby enabling continuous-time state-space characterization of both long-term and short-term fading. Building on this model, a generalized optimal control framework is developed via a fractional Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation that incorporates the Riesz fractional operator to capture non-local spatial effects and memory-dependent dynamics. The existence and uniqueness of viscosity solutions to the fractional HJB equation are rigorously established, thus ensuring the theoretical validity of the proposed control formulation. Numerical simulations conducted in a multi-cell, multi-user downlink setting demonstrate the effectiveness of the fractional HJB-based strategy in optimizing transmission power under heavy-tailed co-channel and multi-user interference.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u79f0\u03b1\u7a33\u5b9aL\u00e9vy\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u65e0\u7ebf\u4fe1\u9053\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5206\u6570\u9636HJB\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4f18\u53166G\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u4fe1\u9053\u4e2d\u7684\u4f20\u8f93\u529f\u7387\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "6G\u65e0\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u9ad8\u901f\u5217\u8f66\u7a7f\u8d8a\u5bc6\u96c6\u57ce\u533a\u548c\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5c71\u5730\u94fe\u8def\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u6027\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u4e25\u91cd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u573a\u666f\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u5c3e\u8870\u843d\u548c\u7a81\u53d1\u4fe1\u53f7\u6ce2\u52a8\u7684\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u4fe1\u9053\u7279\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u79f0\u03b1\u7a33\u5b9aL\u00e9vy\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5efa\u7acb\u65e0\u7ebf\u4fe1\u9053\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u5305\u542bRiesz\u5206\u6570\u9636\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u5206\u6570\u9636Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman\u65b9\u7a0b\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u975e\u5c40\u90e8\u7a7a\u95f4\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u76f8\u5173\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u4e25\u683c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5206\u6570\u9636HJB\u65b9\u7a0b\u7c98\u6027\u89e3\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u548c\u552f\u4e00\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u5c0f\u533a\u591a\u7528\u6237\u4e0b\u884c\u94fe\u8def\u573a\u666f\u7684\u6570\u503c\u4eff\u771f\u4e2d\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u6570\u9636HJB\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u91cd\u5c3e\u5171\u4fe1\u9053\u548c\u591a\u7528\u6237\u5e72\u6270\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u4f20\u8f93\u529f\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5206\u6570\u9636HJB\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a6G\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u6311\u6218\u6027\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Despite their strengths, these models often encounter challenges in achieving complex reasoning tasks such as mathematical problem-solving. Previous works have focused on fine-tuning on specialized mathematical datasets. However, these datasets are typically distilled directly from teacher models, which capture only static reasoning patterns and leaving substantial gaps compared to student models. This reliance on fixed teacher-derived datasets not only restricts the model's ability to adapt to novel or more intricate questions that extend beyond the confines of the training data, but also lacks the iterative depth needed for robust generalization. To overcome these limitations, we propose \\textbf{\\method}, a \\textbf{Math}ematical \\textbf{S}elf-\\textbf{E}volving framework for MLLMs. In contrast to traditional one-shot fine-tuning paradigms, \\method iteratively refines the model through cycles of inference, reflection, and reward-based feedback. Specifically, we leverage iterative fine-tuning by incorporating correct reasoning paths derived from previous-stage inference and integrating reflections from a specialized Outcome Reward Model (ORM).

While visual-inertial SLAM has become a standard in robotics, its integration into automotive ego-motion estimation remains largely unexplored. This paper investigates how visual SLAM can be integrated into consumer-grade vehicle localization systems to improve performance. We propose a framework that fuses visual SLAM with a lateral vehicle dynamics model to achieve online gyroscope calibration under realistic driving conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that vision-based integration significantly improves gyroscope calibration accuracy and thus enhances overall localization performance, highlighting a promising path toward higher automotive localization accuracy.

But trade-offs between costs and technical potential between land categories, especially brownfields and rooftop sites, have not been quantified, despite increasing resistance to and policy interest in reducing use of greenfield sites (e.g., prime agricultural lands). We examine the effect of siting decisions across land types for utility-scale and rooftop PV on the feasibility and cost of meeting solar deployment targets across the Eastern U.S. We build a database of solar PV supply curves by land type for each county in the Eastern Interconnect (EI) region (~2,400 counties). Our supply curves quantify technical potential versus levelized cost across greenfield, brownfield, and rooftop land types. With these supply curves and a 2035 solar deployment target (435 GW) aligned with a decarbonized power system, we quantify cost and capacity trade-offs using scenarios that prioritize solar PV deployment on different land types. We find greenfield, particularly prime agriculture, sites offer the lowest levelized costs for meeting capacity targets, of 39 to 57 $/MWh. Contaminated lands, often prioritized in policy to reduce land use conflict, have limited technical potential and impose a cost premium of 14-33% relative to greenfield sites. Rooftop PV provides enough technical potential for meeting capacity targets but comes at consistently higher costs, with minimum LCOEs of roughly 70 $/MWh or well above the highest-cost greenfield sites. Our results detail heterogeneous siting trade-offs across the Eastern United States, enabling targeted policy design to meet deployment targets while balancing costs and land use conflicts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u7f8e\u56fd\u4e1c\u90e8\u5730\u533a\u4e0d\u540c\u571f\u5730\u7c7b\u578b\uff08\u7eff\u5730\u3001\u68d5\u5730\u3001\u5c4b\u9876\uff09\u4e0a\u592a\u9633\u80fd\u5149\u4f0f\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u6210\u672c\u548c\u6280\u672f\u6f5c\u529b\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7eff\u5730\u7684\u6210\u672c\u6700\u4f4e\uff0c\u68d5\u5730\u6280\u672f\u6f5c\u529b\u6709\u9650\u4e14\u6210\u672c\u8f83\u9ad8\uff0c\u5c4b\u9876\u5149\u4f0f\u6210\u672c\u6700\u9ad8\u4f46\u6280\u672f\u6f5c\u529b\u8db3\u591f\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5bf9\u7eff\u5730\uff08\u5982\u4f18\u8d28\u519c\u7530\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u62b5\u5236\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u5173\u6ce8\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u91cf\u5316\u4e0d\u540c\u571f\u5730\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0a\u592a\u9633\u80fd\u5149\u4f0f\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u6210\u672c\u548c\u6280\u672f\u6f5c\u529b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u90e8\u7f72\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u571f\u5730\u4f7f\u7528\u51b2\u7a81\u3002", "method": "\u4e3a\u7f8e\u56fd\u4e1c\u90e8\u4e92\u8054\u7535\u7f51\u533a\u57df\u7684\u7ea62400\u4e2a\u53bf\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u6309\u571f\u5730\u7c7b\u578b\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u592a\u9633\u80fd\u5149\u4f0f\u4f9b\u5e94\u66f2\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u5e93\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u7eff\u5730\u3001\u68d5\u5730\u548c\u5c4b\u9876\u571f\u5730\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u6280\u672f\u6f5c\u529b\u4e0e\u5e73\u51c6\u5316\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u75282035\u5e74\u592a\u9633\u80fd\u90e8\u7f72\u76ee\u6807\uff08435 GW\uff09\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u571f\u5730\u7c7b\u578b\u4f18\u5148\u90e8\u7f72\u60c5\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6210\u672c\u548c\u5bb9\u91cf\u6743\u8861\u3002", "result": "\u7eff\u5730\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u4f18\u8d28\u519c\u7530\uff09\u63d0\u4f9b\u6700\u4f4e\u7684\u5e73\u51c6\u5316\u6210\u672c\uff0839-57\u7f8e\u5143/\u5146\u74e6\u65f6\uff09\uff1b\u53d7\u6c61\u67d3\u571f\u5730\u6280\u672f\u6f5c\u529b\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u6bd4\u7eff\u5730\u9ad814-33%\uff1b\u5c4b\u9876\u5149\u4f0f\u6280\u672f\u6f5c\u529b\u8db3\u591f\u4f46\u6210\u672c\u8f83\u9ad8\uff0c\u6700\u4f4e\u5e73\u51c6\u5316\u6210\u672c\u7ea670\u7f8e\u5143/\u5146\u74e6\u65f6\uff0c\u8fdc\u9ad8\u4e8e\u6700\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u7684\u7eff\u5730\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7f8e\u56fd\u4e1c\u90e8\u5730\u533a\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u7684\u9009\u5740\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u4e3a\u5236\u5b9a\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u653f\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u4ee5\u5728\u5e73\u8861\u6210\u672c\u548c\u571f\u5730\u4f7f\u7528\u51b2\u7a81\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u90e8\u7f72\u76ee\u6807\u3002"}}

This paper presents Raspi$^2$USBL, an open-source, Raspberry Pi-based passive inverted ultra-short baseline (piUSBL) positioning system designed to provide a low-cost and accessible solution for underwater robotic research. The system comprises a passive acoustic receiver and an active beacon. The receiver adopts a modular hardware architecture that integrates a hydrophone array, a multichannel preamplifier, an oven-controlled crystal oscillator (OCXO), a Raspberry Pi 5, and an MCC-series data acquisition (DAQ) board. Apart from the Pi 5, OCXO, and MCC board, the beacon comprises an impedance-matching network, a power amplifier, and a transmitting transducer. An open-source C++ software framework provides high-precision clock synchronization and triggering for one-way travel-time (OWTT) messaging, while performing real-time signal processing, including matched filtering, array beamforming, and adaptive gain control, to estimate the time of flight (TOF) and direction of arrival (DOA) of received signals. The Raspi$^2$USBL system was experimentally validated in an anechoic tank, freshwater lake, and open-sea trials.

The control design leverages the Nagumo Theorem and the Comparison Lemma to prove constraint satisfaction, while employing min-norm optimal controllers in a manner akin to Control Barrier Functions. This results in a continuous piecewise-linear state feedback policy that maintains the analyzability of the closed-loop system through the principles of linear systems theory. Additionally, we derive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) robustness margins, demonstrating that our approach enables robust tracking of external commands even in the presence of operational constraints. Moreover, the proposed control design offers a systematic approach for anti-windup protection. Through flight control trade studies, we illustrate the applicability of the proposed framework to real-world safety-critical aircraft control scenarios. Notably, MIMO margin analysis with active constraints reveals that our method preserves gain and phase margins comparable to those of the unconstrained case, in contrast to controllers that rely on hard saturation heuristics, which suffer significant performance degradation under active constraints.

Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently shown great potential in this field, their ability to capture the intrinsic connections between explicit and implicit emotions remains limited. We propose a novel ERC training framework, PRC-Emo, which integrates Prompt engineering, demonstration Retrieval, and Curriculum learning, with the goal of exploring whether LLMs can effectively perceive emotions in conversational contexts. Specifically, we design emotion-sensitive prompt templates based on both explicit and implicit emotional cues to better guide the model in understanding the speaker's psychological states. We construct the first dedicated demonstration retrieval repository for ERC, which includes training samples from widely used datasets, as well as high-quality dialogue examples generated by LLMs and manually verified. Moreover, we introduce a curriculum learning strategy into the LoRA fine-tuning process, incorporating weighted emotional shifts between same-speaker and different-speaker utterances to assign difficulty levels to dialogue samples, which are then organized in an easy-to-hard training sequence.

Classical formulations of the Stackelberg equilibrium (SE) assume that the follower's best response (BR) mapping is known to the leader. However, this is not always true in practice. In those cases the leader needs to simultaneously infer this BR function while fulfilling an internal objective. We study a setting in which the leader selects a control strategy that optimizes an objective given an initial belief about the follower's best response. This belief is updated during the finite decision horizon, prompting the leader to reoptimize its control.

Analogous to how perceived facial age reflects an individual's health, the visual appearance of a city serves as its ``portrait\", encapsulating latent socio-economic and environmental characteristics. Recent studies have explored leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to incorporate textual knowledge into imagery-based urban region representation learning. However, two major challenges remain: i)~difficulty in aligning fine-grained visual features with long captions, and ii) suboptimal knowledge incorporation due to noise in LLM-generated captions. To address these issues, we propose a novel pre-training framework called UrbanLN that improves Urban region representation learning through Long-text awareness and Noise suppression. Specifically, we introduce an information-preserved stretching interpolation strategy that aligns long captions with fine-grained visual semantics in complex urban scenes. To effectively mine knowledge from LLM-generated captions and filter out noise, we propose a dual-level optimization strategy. At the data level, a multi-model collaboration pipeline automatically generates diverse and reliable captions without human intervention. At the model level, we employ a momentum-based self-distillation mechanism to generate stable pseudo-targets, facilitating robust cross-modal learning under noisy conditions. Extensive experiments across four real-world cities and various downstream tasks demonstrate the superior performance of our UrbanLN.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faUrbanLN\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u957f\u6587\u672c\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u6291\u5236\u6539\u8fdb\u57ce\u5e02\u533a\u57df\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u957f\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u9f50\u56f0\u96be\u4ee5\u53caLLM\u751f\u6210\u63cf\u8ff0\u566a\u58f0\u95ee\u9898", "motivation": "\u57ce\u5e02\u89c6\u89c9\u5916\u89c2\u5982\u540c\"\u8096\u50cf\"\uff0c\u8574\u542b\u793e\u4f1a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u73af\u5883\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u957f\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u9f50\u4ee5\u53caLLM\u751f\u6210\u63cf\u8ff0\u566a\u58f0\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4fe1\u606f\u4fdd\u7559\u62c9\u4f38\u63d2\u503c\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u9f50\u957f\u6587\u672c\u4e0e\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u4e49\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u7ea7\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u6570\u636e\u7ea7\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u534f\u4f5c\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u5316\u53ef\u9760\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u7ea7\u4f7f\u7528\u52a8\u91cf\u81ea\u84b8\u998f\u673a\u5236\u751f\u6210\u7a33\u5b9a\u4f2a\u76ee\u6807", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u57ce\u5e02\u548c\u591a\u79cd\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eUrbanLN\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd", "conclusion": "UrbanLN\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u57ce\u5e02\u533a\u57df\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u957f\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u6291\u5236\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c"}}

Factors such as tire characteristics, road surface conditions, aerodynamic disturbances, and vehicle load make it infeasible to model real-world dynamics accurately, which hinders direct transfer of RL agents trained in simulation. In this paper, we present a framework that decouples motion planning from vehicle control through a spatial and temporal alignment strategy between a virtual vehicle and the real system. An RL agent is first trained in simulation using a kinematic bicycle model to output continuous control actions. Its behavior is then distilled into a trajectory-predicting agent that generates finite-horizon ego-vehicle trajectories, enabling synchronization between virtual and real vehicles. At deployment, a Stanley controller governs lateral dynamics, while longitudinal alignment is maintained through adaptive update mechanisms that compensate for deviations between virtual and real trajectories. We validate our approach on a real vehicle and demonstrate that the proposed alignment strategy enables robust zero-shot transfer of RL-based motion planning from simulation to reality, successfully decoupling high-level trajectory generation from low-level vehicle control.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u4e0e\u8f66\u8f86\u63a7\u5236\u89e3\u8026\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u865a\u62df\u8f66\u8f86\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4ece\u4eff\u771f\u5230\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u8f66\u8f86\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u4eff\u771f\u4e0e\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u5c06\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u76f4\u63a5\u90e8\u7f72\u5230\u771f\u5b9e\u8f66\u8f86\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002\u8f6e\u80ce\u7279\u6027\u3001\u8def\u9762\u6761\u4ef6\u3001\u7a7a\u6c14\u52a8\u529b\u6270\u52a8\u548c\u8f66\u8f86\u8d1f\u8f7d\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\u4f7f\u5f97\u51c6\u786e\u5efa\u6a21\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u81ea\u884c\u8f66\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3RL\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8f93\u51fa\u8fde\u7eed\u63a7\u5236\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5c06\u5176\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u70bc\u4e3a\u9884\u6d4b\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u3002\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528Stanley\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u63a7\u5236\u6a2a\u5411\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u66f4\u65b0\u673a\u5236\u7ef4\u6301\u7eb5\u5411\u5bf9\u9f50\u4ee5\u8865\u507f\u865a\u62df\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u8f66\u8f86\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u4ece\u4eff\u771f\u5230\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u5730\u5c06\u9ad8\u5c42\u8f68\u8ff9\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u4f4e\u5c42\u8f66\u8f86\u63a7\u5236\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) can specialize models but often triggers a ``seesaw'' between in-distribution gains and out-of-distribution robustness, especially for smaller models. To address these challenges, we introduce RedOne 2.0, an SNS-oriented LLM trained with a progressive, RL-prioritized post-training paradigm designed for rapid and stable adaptation. The pipeline consist in three stages: (1) Exploratory Learning on curated SNS corpora to establish initial alignment and identify systematic weaknesses; (2) Targeted Fine-Tuning that selectively applies SFT to the diagnosed gaps while mixing a small fraction of general data to mitigate forgetting; and (3) Refinement Learning that re-applies RL with SNS-centric signals to consolidate improvements and harmonize trade-offs across tasks.

Roadmap design, specifying feasible transport routes, directly affects fleet coordination and computational performance. Existing approaches are either grid-based, compromising geometric precision, or continuous-space approaches that disregard practical constraints. This paper presents an automated roadmap generation approach that bridges this gap by operating in continuous-space, integrating station-to-station transport demand and enforcing minimum distance constraints for nodes and edges. By combining free space discretization, transport demand-driven $K$-shortest-path optimization, and path smoothing, the approach produces roadmaps tailored to intralogistics applications. Evaluation across multiple intralogistics use cases demonstrates that the proposed approach consistently outperforms established baselines (4-connected grid, 8-connected grid, and random sampling), achieving lower structural complexity, higher redundancy, and near-optimal path lengths, enabling efficient and robust routing of mobile robot fleets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8def\u7ebf\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7ed3\u5408\u8fd0\u8f93\u9700\u6c42\u548c\u6700\u5c0f\u8ddd\u79bb\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u4e3a\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8f66\u961f\u521b\u5efa\u9ad8\u6548\u8def\u7ebf\u56fe\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f51\u683c\uff08\u727a\u7272\u51e0\u4f55\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff09\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u662f\u8fde\u7eed\u7a7a\u95f4\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5ffd\u7565\u5b9e\u9645\u7ea6\u675f\uff09\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u517c\u987e\u51e0\u4f55\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u8def\u7ebf\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u7531\u7a7a\u95f4\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u3001\u8fd0\u8f93\u9700\u6c42\u9a71\u52a8\u7684K\u6700\u77ed\u8def\u5f84\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u8def\u5f84\u5e73\u6ed1\uff0c\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u8def\u7ebf\u56fe\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u7ad9\u70b9\u95f4\u8fd0\u8f93\u9700\u6c42\u5e76\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u8282\u70b9\u548c\u8fb9\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u8ddd\u79bb\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5185\u90e8\u7269\u6d41\u7528\u4f8b\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\uff084\u8fde\u63a5\u7f51\u683c\u30018\u8fde\u63a5\u7f51\u683c\u548c\u968f\u673a\u91c7\u6837\uff09\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3001\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u5197\u4f59\u5ea6\u548c\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u957f\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u4e3a\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8f66\u961f\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u8def\u7531\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5185\u90e8\u7269\u6d41\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3002"}}

By situating LLM reasoning within these formal structures, the approach transforms opaque inference into transparent and auditable decision traces. A layered architecture is presented that separates the reasoning space of the LLM from the explainable process space above it.

Extended version of a paper presented at the Hamlyn Symposium for Medical Robotics, 2025", "summary": "Diagnostic medical ultrasound is widely used, safe, and relatively low cost but requires a high degree of expertise to acquire and interpret the images. Personnel with this expertise are often not available outside of larger cities, leading to difficult, costly travel and long wait times for rural populations. To address this issue, tele-ultrasound techniques are being developed, including robotic teleoperation and recently human teleoperation, in which a novice user is remotely guided in a hand-over-hand manner through mixed reality to perform an ultrasound exam. These methods have not been compared, and their relative strengths are unknown. Human teleoperation may be more practical than robotics for small communities due to its lower cost and complexity, but this is only relevant if the performance is comparable. This paper therefore evaluates the differences between human and robotic teleoperation, examining practical aspects such as setup time and flexibility and experimentally comparing performance metrics such as completion time, position tracking, and force consistency. It is found that human teleoperation does not lead to statistically significant differences in completion time or position accuracy, with mean differences of 1.8% and 0.5%, respectively, and provides more consistent force application despite being substantially more practical and accessible.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u8fdc\u7a0b\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8fdc\u7a0b\u64cd\u4f5c\u5728\u8d85\u58f0\u68c0\u67e5\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e24\u8005\u5728\u5b8c\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0a\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4eba\u7c7b\u8fdc\u7a0b\u64cd\u4f5c\u5728\u529b\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u9762\u66f4\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u66f4\u5177\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u519c\u6751\u5730\u533a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8d85\u58f0\u68c0\u67e5\u4e13\u4e1a\u4eba\u5458\u7684\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4eba\u7c7b\u8fdc\u7a0b\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8fdc\u7a0b\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4eba\u7c7b\u8fdc\u7a0b\u64cd\u4f5c\u5728\u5c0f\u578b\u793e\u533a\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4eba\u7c7b\u8fdc\u7a0b\u64cd\u4f5c\u548c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8fdc\u7a0b\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8bbe\u7f6e\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3001\u5b8c\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u529b\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u4eba\u7c7b\u8fdc\u7a0b\u64cd\u4f5c\u5728\u5b8c\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8fdc\u7a0b\u64cd\u4f5c\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff08\u5e73\u5747\u5dee\u5f02\u5206\u522b\u4e3a1.8%\u548c0.5%\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u529b\u5e94\u7528\u65b9\u9762\u66f4\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4e14\u66f4\u5177\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u53ca\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4eba\u7c7b\u8fdc\u7a0b\u64cd\u4f5c\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8fdc\u7a0b\u64cd\u4f5c\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u6210\u672c\u66f4\u4f4e\u3001\u590d\u6742\u6027\u66f4\u5c0f\uff0c\u5728\u5c0f\u578b\u793e\u533a\u4e2d\u66f4\u5177\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u53ca\u6027\u3002"}}

This has led to incremental improvements without a deep understanding of the current failures. While it is straightforward to look at situations where the model fails, it is hard to understand the underlying reason. This motivates us to conduct a systematic study, where inputs to the model are perturbed and the predictions observed. We introduce PlanT 2.0, a lightweight, object-centric planning transformer designed for autonomous driving research in CARLA. The object-level representation enables controlled analysis, as the input can be easily perturbed (e.g., by changing the location or adding or removing certain objects), in contrast to sensor-based models. To tackle the scenarios newly introduced by the challenging CARLA Leaderboard 2.0, we introduce multiple upgrades to PlanT, achieving state-of-the-art performance on Longest6 v2, Bench2Drive, and the CARLA validation routes. Our analysis exposes insightful failures, such as a lack of scene understanding caused by low obstacle diversity, rigid expert behaviors leading to exploitable shortcuts, and overfitting to a fixed set of expert trajectories. Based on these findings, we argue for a shift toward data-centric development, with a focus on richer, more robust, and less biased datasets.

In a nutshell, the idea is to assign each interpretation a cost based upon the weights of the violated axioms and assertions, and certain and possible query answers are determined by considering all (resp. some) interpretations having optimal or bounded cost. Whereas the initial study of cost-based semantics focused on DLs between $\\mathcal{EL}_\\bot$ and $\\mathcal{ALCO}$, we consider DLs that may contain inverse roles and role inclusions, thus covering prominent DL-Lite dialects. Our data complexity analysis goes significantly beyond existing results by sharpening several lower bounds and pinpointing the precise complexity of optimal-cost certain answer semantics (no non-trivial upper bound was known). Moreover, while all existing results show the intractability of cost-based semantics, our most challenging and surprising result establishes that if we consider $\\text{DL-Lite}^\\mathcal{H}_\\mathsf{bool}$ ontologies and a fixed cost bound, certain answers for instance queries and possible answers for conjunctive queries can be computed using first-order rewriting and thus enjoy the lowest possible data complexity ($\\mathsf{TC}_0$).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u52a0\u6743\u63cf\u8ff0\u903b\u8f91\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u6210\u672c\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0b\u7684\u6570\u636e\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u5305\u542b\u9006\u89d2\u8272\u548c\u89d2\u8272\u5305\u542b\u7684DL\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4e86DL-Lite\u65b9\u8a00\u3002\u4e3b\u8981\u8d21\u732e\u5305\u62ec\u7cbe\u786e\u523b\u753b\u4e86\u6700\u4f18\u6210\u672c\u786e\u5b9a\u7b54\u6848\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u5bf9\u4e8eDL-Lite^H_bool\u672c\u4f53\u548c\u56fa\u5b9a\u6210\u672c\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u7b54\u6848\u548c\u5408\u53d6\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u7b54\u6848\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u9636\u91cd\u5199\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6TC_0\u3002", "motivation": "\u5148\u524d\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8e\u6210\u672c\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728EL\u22a5\u5230ALCO\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\u903b\u8f91\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u6269\u5c55\u7814\u7a76\u8303\u56f4\u5230\u5305\u542b\u9006\u89d2\u8272\u548c\u89d2\u8272\u5305\u542b\u7684DL\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662fDL-Lite\u65b9\u8a00\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u6570\u636e\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u914d\u6bcf\u4e2a\u89e3\u91ca\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fdd\u53cd\u516c\u7406\u548c\u65ad\u8a00\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u548c\u53ef\u80fd\u67e5\u8be2\u7b54\u6848\u901a\u8fc7\u8003\u8651\u6240\u6709\uff08\u6216\u67d0\u4e9b\uff09\u5177\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u6216\u6709\u754c\u6210\u672c\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u6765\u786e\u5b9a\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u6570\u636e\u590d\u6742\u6027\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4e0b\u754c\u7ec6\u5316\u548c\u7cbe\u786e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u523b\u753b\u3002", "result": "\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u7ec6\u5316\u4e86\u591a\u4e2a\u4e0b\u754c\u5e76\u7cbe\u786e\u523b\u753b\u4e86\u6700\u4f18\u6210\u672c\u786e\u5b9a\u7b54\u6848\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002\u6700\u4ee4\u4eba\u60ca\u8bb6\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u662f\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8eDL-Lite^H_bool\u672c\u4f53\u548c\u56fa\u5b9a\u6210\u672c\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u7b54\u6848\u548c\u5408\u53d6\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u7b54\u6848\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u9636\u91cd\u5199\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230TC_0\u6570\u636e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6210\u672c\u8bed\u4e49\u5728\u9002\u5f53\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u53ef\u4ee5\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u52a0\u6743\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728DL-Lite\u65b9\u8a00\u4e2d\u3002"}}

However, the high cost of tactile data collection makes sample efficiency the key requirement for developing visuotactile policies. We present EquiTac, a framework that exploits the inherent SO(2) symmetry of in-hand object rotation to improve sample efficiency and generalization for visuotactile policy learning. EquiTac first reconstructs surface normals from raw RGB inputs of vision-based tactile sensors, so rotations of the normal vector field correspond to in-hand object rotations. An SO(2)-equivariant network then predicts a residual rotation action that augments a base visuomotor policy at test time, enabling real-time rotation correction without additional reorientation demonstrations. On a real robot, EquiTac accurately achieves robust zero-shot generalization to unseen in-hand orientations with very few training samples, where baselines fail even with more training data.

Yu"], "title": "Unified Humanoid Fall-Safety Policy from a Few Demonstrations", "comment": null, "summary": "Falling is an inherent risk of humanoid mobility. Maintaining stability is thus a primary safety focus in robot control and learning, yet no existing approach fully averts loss of balance. When instability does occur, prior work addresses only isolated aspects of falling: avoiding falls, choreographing a controlled descent, or standing up afterward. Consequently, humanoid robots lack integrated strategies for impact mitigation and prompt recovery when real falls defy these scripts. We aim to go beyond keeping balance to make the entire fall-and-recovery process safe and autonomous: prevent falls when possible, reduce impact when unavoidable, and stand up when fallen. By fusing sparse human demonstrations with reinforcement learning and an adaptive diffusion-based memory of safe reactions, we learn adaptive whole-body behaviors that unify fall prevention, impact mitigation, and rapid recovery in one policy. Experiments in simulation and on a Unitree G1 demonstrate robust sim-to-real transfer, lower impact forces, and consistently fast recovery across diverse disturbances, pointing towards safer, more resilient humanoids in real environments.

However, the practical deployment of existing methods is hindered by two key challenges: the prohibitive computational cost of over-parameterized models and the suboptimal performance of conventional loss functions on the highly skewed distribution of urban flows. To address these challenges, we propose a unified solution that synergizes architectural efficiency with adaptive optimization. Specifically, we first introduce PLGF, a lightweight yet powerful architecture that employs a Progressive Local-Global Fusion strategy to effectively capture both fine-grained details and global contextual dependencies. Second, we propose DualFocal Loss, a novel function that integrates dual-space supervision with a difficulty-aware focusing mechanism, enabling the model to adaptively concentrate on hard-to-predict regions. Extensive experiments on 4 real-world scenarios validate the effectiveness and scalability of our method. Notably, while achieving state-of-the-art performance, PLGF reduces the model size by up to 97% compared to current high-performing methods. Furthermore, under comparable parameter budgets, our model yields an accuracy improvement of over 10% against strong baselines.

While there are extensive researches on detecting model generated text, we find that these existing methods are not applicable to time series data due to the fundamental modality difference, as time series usually have lower information density and smoother probability distributions than text data, which limit the discriminative power of token-based detectors. To address this issue, we examine the subtle distributional differences between real and model-generated time series and propose the contraction hypothesis, which states that model-generated time series, unlike real ones, exhibit progressively decreasing uncertainty under recursive forecasting. We formally prove this hypothesis under theoretical assumptions on model behavior and time series structure. Model-generated time series exhibit progressively concentrated distributions under recursive forecasting, leading to uncertainty contraction. We provide empirical validation of the hypothesis across diverse datasets. Building on this insight, we introduce the Uncertainty Contraction Estimator (UCE), a white-box detector that aggregates uncertainty metrics over successive prefixes to identify TSLM-generated time series.

Recent video generation models can synthesize photorealistic visual demonstrations from language commands and images, offering a powerful yet underexplored source of training signals for robotics.

PhysWorld addresses this limitation by coupling video generation with physical world reconstruction. Given a single image and a task command, our method generates task-conditioned videos and reconstructs the underlying physical world from the videos, and the generated video motions are grounded into physically accurate actions through object-centric residual reinforcement learning with the physical world model. This synergy transforms implicit visual guidance into physically executable robotic trajectories, eliminating the need for real robot data collection and enabling zero-shot generalizable robotic manipulation. Experiments on diverse real-world tasks demonstrate that PhysWorld substantially improves manipulation accuracy compared to previous approaches.

Current alignment efforts primarily target explicit risks such as bias, hate speech, and violence. However, they often fail to address deeper, domain-specific implicit risks and lack a flexible, generalizable framework applicable across diverse specialized fields. Hence, we proposed MENTOR: A MEtacognition-driveN self-evoluTion framework for uncOvering and mitigating implicit Risks in LLMs on Domain Tasks. To address the limitations of labor-intensive human evaluation, we introduce a novel metacognitive self-assessment tool. This enables LLMs to reflect on potential value misalignments in their responses using strategies like perspective-taking and consequential thinking. We also release a supporting dataset of 9,000 risk queries spanning education, finance, and management to enhance domain-specific risk identification. Subsequently, based on the outcomes of metacognitive reflection, the framework dynamically generates supplementary rule knowledge graphs that extend predefined static rule trees. This enables models to actively apply validated rules to future similar challenges, establishing a continuous self-evolution cycle that enhances generalization by reducing maintenance costs and inflexibility of static systems. Finally, we employ activation steering during inference to guide LLMs in following the rules, a cost-effective method to robustly enhance enforcement across diverse contexts. Experimental results show MENTOR's effectiveness: In defensive testing across three vertical domains, the framework substantially reduces semantic attack success rates, enabling a new level of implicit risk mitigation for LLMs. Furthermore, metacognitive assessment not only aligns closely with baseline human evaluators but also delivers more thorough and insightful analysis of LLMs value alignment.", "AI": {"tldr": "MENTOR\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u8fdb\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u53d1\u73b0\u548c\u51cf\u8f7bLLMs\u5728\u9886\u57df\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u81ea\u6211\u8bc4\u4f30\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5219\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u751f\u6210\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f15\u5bfc\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6301\u7eed\u81ea\u6211\u8fdb\u5316\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u8bed\u4e49\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dLLMs\u5bf9\u9f50\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u663e\u5f0f\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u9690\u5f0f\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u901a\u7528\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u4f30\u52b3\u52a8\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u7075\u6d3b\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "1. \u5f15\u5165\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u81ea\u6211\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u8ba9LLMs\u901a\u8fc7\u6362\u4f4d\u601d\u8003\u548c\u7ed3\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u53cd\u601d\u4ef7\u503c\u504f\u5dee\uff1b2. \u52a8\u6001\u751f\u6210\u8865\u5145\u89c4\u5219\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u6269\u5c55\u9759\u6001\u89c4\u5219\u6811\uff1b3. \u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f15\u5bfc\u6280\u672f\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u589e\u5f3a\u89c4\u5219\u6267\u884c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5782\u76f4\u9886\u57df\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cMENTOR\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86LLMs\u9690\u5f0f\u98ce\u9669\u7f13\u89e3\u7684\u65b0\u6c34\u5e73\u3002\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4f30\u8005\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4e14\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u6df1\u5165\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u5bf9\u9f50\u5206\u6790\u3002", "conclusion": "MENTOR\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u8fdb\u5316\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86LLMs\u5728\u9886\u57df\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u98ce\u9669\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u9ad8\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5b89\u5168\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

With the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), more and more attempts are being made to apply LLMs to financial areas. A simple, direct application of LLM as an agent shows significant performance. Such methods are hindered by their slow inference speed, while most of the current research has not studied LLM distillation for this specific task. To address this, we first propose the normalized fluorescent probe to study the mechanism of the LLM's feature. Based on the observation found by our investigation, we propose Cooperative Market Making (CMM), a novel framework that decouples LLM features across three orthogonal dimensions: layer, task, and data. Various student models collaboratively learn simple LLM features along with different dimensions, with each model responsible for a distinct feature to achieve knowledge distillation. Furthermore, CMM introduces an H\u00e1jek-MoE to integrate the output of the student models by investigating the contribution of different models in a kernel function-generated common feature space.

The core challenge of AHT is to develop an ego agent that can predict and adapt to unknown teammates on the fly. Conventional RL-based approaches optimize a single expected return, which often causes policies to collapse into a single dominant behavior, thus failing to capture the multimodal cooperation patterns inherent in AHT. In this work, we introduce PADiff, a diffusion-based approach that captures agent's multimodal behaviors, unlocking its diverse cooperation modes with teammates. However, standard diffusion models lack the ability to predict and adapt in highly non-stationary AHT scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a novel diffusion-based policy that integrates critical predictive information about teammates into the denoising process. Extensive experiments across three cooperation environments demonstrate that PADiff outperforms existing AHT methods significantly.", "AI": {"tldr": "PADiff\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3ad hoc teamwork\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u53bb\u566a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u6574\u5408\u961f\u53cb\u9884\u6d4b\u4fe1\u606f\u6765\u9002\u5e94\u9ad8\u5ea6\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u73af\u5883\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfRL\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728ad hoc teamwork\u4e2d\u5bb9\u6613\u9677\u5165\u5355\u4e00\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5408\u4f5c\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u672a\u77e5\u961f\u53cb\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPADiff\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u53bb\u566a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u6574\u5408\u961f\u53cb\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u6837\u5316\u5408\u4f5c\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5408\u4f5c\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cPADiff\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684AHT\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "PADiff\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86AHT\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u672a\u77e5\u961f\u53cb\u7684\u591a\u6837\u5316\u5408\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Across physics-informed learning and operator learning tasks, the framework discovers solution methods that outperform single-agent and human-designed baselines by up to four orders of magnitude in error reduction. The agents produce novel strategies -- including adaptive mixture-of-expert architectures, decomposition-based PINNs, and physics-informed operator learning models -- that do not appear explicitly in the curated knowledge base.

While prior work has focused on detection accuracy, it overlooks the importance of helping users understand the reasoning behind factual judgments and develop future resilience. The debate transcripts generated during MAD offer a rich but underutilized resource for transparent reasoning. In this study, we introduce ED2D, an evidence-based MAD framework that extends previous approach by incorporating factual evidence retrieval. More importantly, ED2D is designed not only as a detection framework but also as a persuasive multi-agent system aimed at correcting user beliefs and discouraging misinformation sharing. We compare the persuasive effects of ED2D-generated debunking transcripts with those authored by human experts. Results demonstrate that ED2D outperforms existing baselines across three misinformation detection benchmarks.

However, existing approaches rely on a mono-contextual paradigm that accumulates all information in a single, expanding context window, leading to context suffocation and noise contamination that limit their effectiveness on long-horizon tasks. We introduce IterResearch, a novel iterative deep-research paradigm that reformulates long-horizon research as a Markov Decision Process with strategic workspace reconstruction. By maintaining an evolving report as memory and periodically synthesizing insights, our approach preserves consistent reasoning capacity across arbitrary exploration depths. We further develop Efficiency-Aware Policy Optimization (EAPO), a reinforcement learning framework that incentivizes efficient exploration through geometric reward discounting and enables stable distributed training via adaptive downsampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IterResearch achieves substantial improvements over existing open-source agents with average +14.5pp across six benchmarks and narrows the gap with frontier proprietary systems. Remarkably, our paradigm exhibits unprecedented interaction scaling, extending to 2048 interactions with dramatic performance gains (from 3.5\\% to 42.5\\%), and serves as an effective prompting strategy, improving frontier models by up to 19.2pp over ReAct on long-horizon tasks.

However, most existing synthetic personas remain shallow and simplistic, capturing minimal attributes and failing to reflect the rich complexity and diversity of real human identities. We introduce DEEPPERSONA, a scalable generative engine for synthesizing narrative-complete synthetic personas through a two-stage, taxonomy-guided method. First, we algorithmically construct the largest-ever human-attribute taxonomy, comprising over hundreds of hierarchically organized attributes, by mining thousands of real user-ChatGPT conversations. Second, we progressively sample attributes from this taxonomy, conditionally generating coherent and realistic personas that average hundreds of structured attributes and roughly 1 MB of narrative text, two orders of magnitude deeper than prior works. Intrinsic evaluations confirm significant improvements in attribute diversity (32 percent higher coverage) and profile uniqueness (44 percent greater) compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Extrinsically, our personas enhance GPT-4.1-mini's personalized question answering accuracy by 11.6 percent on average across ten metrics and substantially narrow (by 31.7 percent) the gap between simulated LLM citizens and authentic human responses in social surveys. Our generated national citizens reduced the performance gap on the Big Five personality test by 17 percent relative to LLM-simulated citizens.

To accelerate this transformation, two fundamental building blocks are essential: high-quality datasets that enable agents to achieve complex and human-relevant goals, and robust evaluation methods that allow researchers and practitioners to rapidly enhance agent performance. In this paper, we introduce DigiData, a large-scale, high-quality, diverse, multi-modal dataset designed for training mobile control agents. Unlike existing datasets, which derive goals from unstructured interactions, DigiData is meticulously constructed through comprehensive exploration of app features, resulting in greater diversity and higher goal complexity. Additionally, we present DigiData-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating mobile control agents on real-world complex tasks. We demonstrate that the commonly used step-accuracy metric falls short in reliably assessing mobile control agents and, to address this, we propose dynamic evaluation protocols and AI-powered evaluations as rigorous alternatives for agent assessment. Our contributions aim to significantly advance the development of mobile control agents, paving the way for more intuitive and effective human-device interactions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86DigiData\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548cDigiData-Bench\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u79fb\u52a8\u63a7\u5236AI\u4ee3\u7406\u3002DigiData\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u9762\u63a2\u7d22\u5e94\u7528\u529f\u80fd\u6784\u5efa\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff1bDigiData-Bench\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u548cAI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u79fb\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u4ee3\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u52a0\u901f\u79fb\u52a8\u63a7\u5236AI\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4ee3\u7406\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u6539\u53d8\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0e\u6570\u5b57\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86DigiData\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u9762\u63a2\u7d22\u5e94\u7528\u529f\u80fd\u800c\u975e\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4ea4\u4e92\u6765\u786e\u4fdd\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff1b\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86DigiData-Bench\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u52a8\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u548cAI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "DigiData\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff1bDigiData-Bench\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u6b65\u9aa4\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u6307\u6807\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8d21\u732e\u663e\u8457\u63a8\u8fdb\u4e86\u79fb\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u4e3a\u66f4\u76f4\u89c2\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u94fa\u5e73\u4e86\u9053\u8def\u3002"}}

We first introduce an 11-layer failure stack, a structured framework for identifying vulnerabilities ranging from hardware and power foundations to adaptive learning and agentic reasoning. Building on this, the chapter demonstrates how failures rarely occur in isolation but propagate across layers, creating cascading effects with systemic consequences. To complement this diagnostic lens, we develop the concept of awareness mapping: a maturity-oriented framework that quantifies how well individuals and organizations recognize reliability risks across the AI stack. Awareness is treated not only as a diagnostic score but also as a strategic input for AI governance, guiding improvement and resilience planning. By linking layered failures to awareness levels and further integrating this into Dependability-Centred Asset Management (DCAM), the chapter positions awareness mapping as both a measurement tool and a roadmap for trustworthy and sustainable AI deployment across mission-critical domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e8611\u5c42\u6545\u969c\u6808\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u548c\u667a\u80fdAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u610f\u8bc6\u6620\u5c04\u6982\u5ff5\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5bf9AI\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u6574\u5408\u5230\u4ee5\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u8d44\u4ea7\u7ba1\u7406\u4e2d\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u548c\u667a\u80fdAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4ece\u786c\u4ef6\u5230\u667a\u80fd\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u591a\u5c42\u6b21\u6545\u969c\u4f20\u64ad\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5bf9AI\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u548c\u51c6\u5907\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u752811\u5c42\u6545\u969c\u6808\u6846\u67b6\u5206\u6790\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u610f\u8bc6\u6620\u5c04\u6210\u719f\u5ea6\u6846\u67b6\u91cf\u5316\u98ce\u9669\u8ba4\u77e5\uff0c\u5e76\u6574\u5408\u5230\u4ee5\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u8d44\u4ea7\u7ba1\u7406(DCAM)\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4ece\u5206\u5c42\u6545\u969c\u5230\u610f\u8bc6\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u8fde\u63a5\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65e2\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6d4b\u91cf\u5de5\u5177\u53c8\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u4fe1AI\u90e8\u7f72\u8def\u7ebf\u56fe\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u610f\u8bc6\u6620\u5c04\u4e0d\u4ec5\u662f\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u66f4\u662fAI\u6cbb\u7406\u7684\u6218\u7565\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u4efb\u52a1\u9886\u57df\u53ef\u4fe1\u548c\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u7684AI\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}
