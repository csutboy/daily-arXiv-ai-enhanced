### [1] [HSBC 1950 to 2025: Conquering the world from British Hong Kong and London](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13878)
*Christopher Mantzaris,Ajda Fošner*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: HSBC在经历战争和政权更迭后，通过收购策略（特别是收购Midland Bank）和适应不同政治环境，从濒临关闭的中国分行发展成为全球银行业巨头。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究HSBC如何在不利的政治环境（如中国内战、共产主义政权）中生存并发展壮大，探索其在面对敌对环境时的成功策略和商业经验。

Method: 通过分析HSBC的历史发展轨迹，重点关注其收购扩张策略（特别是1992年收购Midland Bank），以及在香港经济繁荣和英国金融放松管制背景下的发展。

Result: HSBC成功从中国内战后仅存的上海分行发展成为全球银行业巨头，通过收购Midland Bank等战略举措实现了规模扩张和地域多元化。

Conclusion: HSBC的案例表明，即使在敌对的政治环境中，通过战略性收购、地域多元化和适应监管环境变化，银行可以实现长期繁荣和稳定发展。

Abstract: The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Co (HSBC) just survived a civil war intermitted by World War II. By the 1950s, it obviously needed to close all its branches in Mao's People's Republic of China, yet could somehow hold its Shanghai branch, which continued likely in the shadows, as non-state banking was illegalised and even simple land owners were executed merely for being labelled "capitalist". This Asia-focused bank --in spite of it all-- grew from these conditions into the behemoth it is today. Part of the growth was based on the economic boom in its core market Hong Kong, to which HSBC likely also contributed. To expand and diversify, HSBC continued the growth strategy that already started since its early days in the 1860s, this time just also inorganically: It acquired other banks, in most cases fully and in other regions. The most important acquisition was the takeover of the roughly equally-sized UK-based Midland Bank; for the following reasons: 1) It came just a year after the 1991 change of HSBC's headquarters and place of incorporation to London, so HSBC could smoothly integrate with Midland. This step also came with an additional listing of securities in London, providing HSBC funds. 2) These funds were used efficiently without much idling for the humongous acquisition. 3) The preceding decade of Margaret Thatcher's banking and finance deregulation in the UK created a beneficial environment for HSBC. 4) HSBC was proven right by the developments in Hong Kong, where the Communist Party of China illegally eroded democracy, the rule of law and civil liberties since 2020, despite promising to maintain these at least until 1 July 2047. A list of likely reasons for HSBC's prosperity and stability in face of the at times hostile environments is also provided, from which business lessons can be drawn.

### [2] [Randomized Controlled Trials for Phishing Triage Agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13860)
*James Bono*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: 本文通过随机对照试验评估了Microsoft Security Copilot钓鱼邮件分类AI代理对安全分析师工作效率和准确性的影响，结果显示AI辅助分析师在效率和准确性方面均有显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 安全运营中心(SOCs)面临高效处理大量用户报告的钓鱼邮件同时保持强大威胁防护的持续挑战，需要评估AI代理在提升分析师生产力方面的实际效果。

Method: 采用随机对照试验(RCT)方法，评估Microsoft Security Copilot钓鱼邮件分类AI代理对分析师工作效率和准确性的影响，包括行为分析和队列优先级研究。

Result: AI辅助分析师每分钟真阳性检测数量提升6.5倍，裁决准确性提高77%；分析师将53%更多时间用于恶意邮件分析，且不会盲目接受AI的恶意裁决。

Conclusion: AI代理能够显著改变SOC资源的最优分配方式，为SOC领导者提供AI采用的可操作见解，包括队列优先级和裁决解释的重要作用。

Abstract: Security operations centers (SOCs) face a persistent challenge: efficiently triaging a high volume of user-reported phishing emails while maintaining robust protection against threats. This paper presents the first randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluating the impact of a domain-specific AI agent - the Microsoft Security Copilot Phishing Triage Agent - on analyst productivity and accuracy. Our results demonstrate that agent-augmented analysts achieved up to 6.5 times as many true positives per analyst minute and a 77% improvement in verdict accuracy compared to a control group. The agent's queue prioritization and verdict explanations were both significant drivers of efficiency. Behavioral analysis revealed that agent-augmented analysts reallocated their attention, spending 53% more time on malicious emails, and were not prone to rubber-stamping the agent's malicious verdicts. These findings offer actionable insights for SOC leaders considering AI adoption, including the potential for agents to fundamentally change the optimal allocation of SOC resources.

### [3] [Randomized Controlled Trials for Conditional Access Optimization Agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13865)
*James Bono,Beibei Cheng,Joaquin Lozano*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: AI代理在微软Entra条件访问策略管理中的首个随机对照试验显示，AI辅助使管理员准确性提高48%，任务完成时间减少43%，特别是在认知要求高的任务上效果显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估AI代理在企业身份治理中的有效性，特别是在条件访问策略管理方面的实际表现。

Method: 在162名身份管理员中进行的随机对照试验，分为对照组（无AI代理）和实验组（AI辅助），在四个高价值任务上测试：策略合并、零信任基线差距检测、分阶段部署规划和用户策略对齐。

Result: AI辅助显著提升了表现：准确性提高48%，任务完成时间减少43%。在认知要求高的任务（如基线差距检测）上获益最大。

Conclusion: 专门构建的AI代理能够显著提高身份管理的速度和准确性，特别是在复杂认知任务上。

Abstract: AI agents are increasingly deployed to automate complex enterprise workflows, yet evidence of their effectiveness in identity governance is limited. We report results from the first randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluating an AI agent for Conditional Access (CA) policy management in Microsoft Entra. The agent assists with four high-value tasks: policy merging, Zero-Trust baseline gap detection, phased rollout planning, and user-policy alignment. In a production-grade environment, 162 identity administrators were randomly assigned to a control group (no agent) or treatment group (agent-assisted) and asked to perform these tasks. Agent access produced substantial gains: accuracy improved by 48% and task completion time decreased by 43% while holding accuracy constant. The largest benefits emerged on cognitively demanding tasks such as baseline gap detection. These findings demonstrate that purpose-built AI agents can significantly enhance both speed and accuracy in identity administration.

### [4] [Empirical Quantum Advantage in Constrained Optimization from Encoded Unitary Designs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14296)
*Chinonso Onah,Roman Firt,Kristel Michielsen*

Main category: cs.ET

TL;DR: 提出约束增强量子近似优化算法(CE-QAOA)，一种浅层约束感知ansatz，在[n]^m的单热积空间中运行，通过无辅助量子比特的深度最优编码器准备W_n态，结合经典验证器构建多项式时间混合量子经典求解器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统量子优化算法在处理约束优化问题时面临的挑战，特别是旅行商问题(TSP)等组合优化问题，通过约束感知设计减少量子资源需求并提高效率。

Method: 使用单热积空间编码，每个块初始化W_n态，采用块内两局域XY混合器，结合经典验证器对量子采样结果进行可行性检查，返回最佳可行解。

Result: 在无噪声电路模拟中，对4-10个城市的TSP实例，在深度p=1时使用多项式采样预算和粗粒度参数网格即可恢复全局最优解，相比经典采样器获得指数级分离优势。

Conclusion: CE-QAOA通过约束感知设计和混合量子经典框架，在浅层深度下有效解决约束优化问题，显著减少量子资源需求并实现优于经典方法的性能。

Abstract: We introduce the Constraint-Enhanced Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (CE-QAOA), a shallow, constraint-aware ansatz that operates inside the one-hot product space of size [n]^m, where m is the number of blocks and each block is initialized with an n-qubit W_n state. We give an ancilla-free, depth-optimal encoder that prepares a W_n state using n-1 two-qubit rotations per block, and a two-local XY mixer restricted to the same block of n qubits with a constant spectral gap. Algorithmically, we wrap constant-depth sampling with a deterministic classical checker to obtain a polynomial-time hybrid quantum-classical solver (PHQC) that returns the best observed feasible solution in O(S n^2) time, where S is the number of shots. We obtain two advantages. First, when CE-QAOA fixes r >= 1 locations different from the start city, we achieve a Theta(n^r) reduction in shot complexity even against a classical sampler that draws uniformly from the feasible set. Second, against a classical baseline restricted to raw bitstring sampling, we show an exp(Theta(n^2)) separation in the minimax sense. In noiseless circuit simulations of TSP instances ranging from 4 to 10 locations from the QOPTLib benchmark library, we recover the global optimum at depth p = 1 using polynomial shot budgets and coarse parameter grids defined by the problem sizes.

### [5] [PIM or CXL-PIM? Understanding Architectural Trade-offs Through Large-Scale Benchmarking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14400)
*I-Ting Lee,Bao-Kai Wang,Liang-Chi Chen,Wen Sheng Lim,Da-Wei Chang,Yu-Ming Chang,Chieng-Chung Ho*

Main category: cs.ET

TL;DR: 本文通过大规模对比PIM和CXL-PIM架构，发现统一地址空间的CXL-PIM在某些情况下能克服传输瓶颈，而紧密耦合的PIM在其他场景下更优，为近内存系统设计提供实用指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PIM硬件因主机和设备地址空间分离导致显式传输成为性能瓶颈，而CXL-PIM提供统一地址空间但访问延迟更高，两种接口模型存在工作负载相关的权衡，需要大规模研究来理解这些权衡。

Method: 使用真实PIM硬件测量和基于跟踪的CXL建模，进行大规模并排比较分析，识别统一地址访问何时能分摊链路延迟以克服传输瓶颈。

Result: 研究结果揭示了阶段和数据集大小机制下两种架构的相对排名会发生反转，CXL-PIM在统一地址访问能分摊链路延迟时表现更好，而紧密耦合PIM在其他情况下更优。

Conclusion: PIM和CXL-PIM架构的选择取决于具体工作负载特征，未来近内存系统设计需要根据应用场景灵活选择架构方案。

Abstract: Processing-in-memory (PIM) reduces data movement by executing near memory, but our large-scale characterization on real PIM hardware shows that end-to-end performance is often limited by disjoint host and device address spaces that force explicit staging transfers. In contrast, CXL-PIM provides a unified address space and cache-coherent access at the cost of higher access latency. These opposing interface models create workload-dependent tradeoffs that are not captured by small-scale studies. This work presents a side-by-side, large-scale comparison of PIM and CXL-PIM using measurements from real PIM hardware and trace-driven CXL modeling. We identify when unified-address access amortizes link latency enough to overcome transfer bottlenecks, and when tightly coupled PIM remains preferable. Our results reveal phase- and dataset-size regimes in which the relative ranking between the two architectures reverses, offering practical guidance for future near-memory system design.

### [6] [Graph Neural Networks for Vehicular Social Networks: Trends, Challenges, and Opportunities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14720)
*Elham Binshaflout,Aymen Hamrouni,Hakim Ghazzai*

Main category: cs.ET

TL;DR: 这是首篇专门综述图神经网络在车载社交网络中应用的论文，系统分类分析了GNN在交通预测、信号控制等VSN任务中的表现，指出GNN在提升准确性方面潜力巨大，但缺乏对完整VSN建模的研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图神经网络因其处理复杂互联数据的强大能力，特别适合智能交通系统应用。本文旨在填补GNN在车载社交网络领域综述的空白，系统梳理现有研究成果。

Method: 通过系统文献综述方法，按照VSN相关任务对现有研究进行分类分析，包括交通流预测、轨迹预测、信号控制等，并提供定量分析和关键见解。

Result: 研究发现GNN在提升特定任务或子VSN图的准确性、鲁棒性和实时性能方面表现出强大潜力，但缺乏对完整独立VSN的建模研究。

Conclusion: 随着数据可用性的增加和图学习的进展，GNN有望在未来大规模、完全集成的VSN应用中发挥核心作用，但需要更多对完整VSN建模的研究。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for modeling complex, interconnected data, making them particularly well suited for a wide range of Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) applications. This survey presents the first comprehensive review dedicated specifically to the use of GNNs within Vehicular Social Networks (VSNs). By leveraging both Euclidean and non-Euclidean transportation-related data, including traffic patterns, road users, and weather conditions, GNNs offer promising solutions for analyzing and enhancing VSN applications. The survey systematically categorizes and analyzes existing studies according to major VSN-related tasks, including traffic flow and trajectory prediction, traffic forecasting, signal control, driving assistance, routing problem, and connectivity management. It further provides quantitative insights and synthesizes key takeaways derived from the literature review. Additionally, the survey examines the available datasets and outlines open research directions needed to advance GNN-based VSN applications. The findings indicate that, although GNNs demonstrate strong potential for improving the accuracy, robustness, and real-time performances of on task-specific or sub-VSN graphs, there remains a notable absence of studies that model a complete, standalone VSN encompassing all functional components. With the increasing availability of data and continued progress in graph learning, GNNs are expected to play a central role in enabling future large-scale and fully integrated VSN applications.

### [7] [A Deep Learning Density Shaping Model Predictive Gust Load Alleviation Control of a Compliant Wing Subjected to Atmospheric Turbulence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13745)
*Seid H. Pourtakdoust,Amir H. Khodabakhsh*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度学习的随机阵风载荷减缓方法，通过主动调整机翼弯度来减轻柔性机翼的随机阵风载荷和翼尖偏转。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对柔性机翼在随机阵风条件下的载荷减缓问题，传统方法难以有效处理随机性，需要开发能够处理概率密度演化的智能控制方法。

Method: 使用基于深度学习的模型预测控制器，通过物理信息神经网络求解概率密度演化方程，并利用自动微分进行MPC优化，实现机翼弯度的主动控制。

Result: 在柔性机翼模型上的数值模拟显示，该方法能有效减轻随机阵风载荷，减少翼尖偏转，在Band-Limited White Noise和Dryden阵风模型下均表现良好。

Conclusion: 所提出的概率密度成形模型预测控制方法为柔性机翼的随机阵风载荷减缓提供了一种有效的深度学习方法。

Abstract: This study presents a novel deep learning approach aimed at enhancing stochastic Gust Load Alleviation (GLA) specifically for compliant wings. The approach incorporates the concept of smooth wing camber variation, where the camber of the wing's chord is actively adjusted during flight using a control signal to achieve the desired aerodynamic loading. The proposed method employs a deep learning-based model predictive controller designed for probability density shaping. This controller effectively solves the probability density evolution equation through a custom Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) and utilizes Automatic Differentiation for Model Predictive Control (MPC) optimization. Comprehensive numerical simulations were conducted on a compliant wing (CW) model, evaluating performance of the proposed approach against stochastic gust profiles. The evaluation involved stochastic aerodynamic loads generated from Band-Limited White Noise (BLWN) and Dryden gust models. The evaluation were conducted for two distinct Compliant Chord Fractions (CCF). The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed probability density shaping model predictive control in alleviating stochastic gust load and reducing wing tip deflection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决航天器姿态控制中存在的指向禁区约束问题，传统方法难以有效处理此类复杂约束，需要开发能够自动学习约束策略的控制方法。

Method: 采用Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)深度强化学习算法，设计了包含姿态约束区紧凑表示的新状态表示方法，构建了实现控制目标并强制执行姿态约束的奖励函数，使用课程学习方法进行智能体训练。

Abstract: This paper implements deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for spacecraft reorientation control with a single pointing keep-out zone. The Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm is adopted to handle continuous state and action space. A new state representation is designed to explicitly include a compact representation of the attitude constraint zone. The reward function is formulated to achieve the control objective while enforcing the attitude constraint. A curriculum learning approach is used for the agent training. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DRL-based method for spacecraft pointing-constrained attitude control.

### [9] [Game-theoretic Decentralized Coordination for Airspace Sector Overload Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13770)

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 提出一种基于最佳响应动态的去中心化空中交通管理机制，通过可调节的合作因子建模自私行为，证明其满足势博弈结构并能收敛到纯纳什均衡，在最小合作下显著减少过载。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 去中心化空中交通管理系统虽然可扩展，但通常假设高度合作，而实践中各空域部门独立运作且优先考虑本地目标，导致过载问题。

Method: 每个部门调整其控制航班的起飞时间以减少自身拥堵，无需共享决策。使用可调合作因子建模各部门愿意减少其他部门过载的程度，基于最佳响应动态。

Result: 数值实验使用24小时欧洲航班数据，证明该算法即使在最小合作下也能显著减少过载，保持可扩展性且与集中式求解器解决方案质量相当。

Conclusion: 所提机制满足势博弈结构，确保最佳响应动态收敛到纯纳什均衡，在轻度限制下能实现过载自由解，为去中心化空中交通管理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Decentralized air traffic management systems offer a scalable alternative to centralized control, but often assume high levels of cooperation. In practice, such assumptions frequently break down since airspace sectors operate independently and prioritize local objectives. We address the problem of sector overload in decentralized air traffic management by proposing a mechanism that models self-interested behaviors based on best response dynamics. Each sector adjusts the departure times of flights under its control to reduce its own congestion, without any shared decision making. A tunable cooperativeness factor models the degree to which each sector is willing to reduce overload in other sectors. We prove that the proposed mechanism satisfies a potential game structure, ensuring that best response dynamics converge to a pure Nash equilibrium, under a mild restriction. In addition, we identify a sufficient condition under which an overload-free solution corresponds to a global minimizer of the potential function. Numerical experiments using 24 hours of European flight data demonstrate that the proposed algorithm substantially reduces overload even with only minimal cooperation between sectors, while maintaining scalability and matching the solution quality of centralized solvers.

### [10] [Tri-Level Stochastic-Robust Co-Planning of Distribution Networks and Renewable Charging Stations With an Adaptive iC&CG Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13776)
*Yongheng Wang,Xiemin Mo,Tao Liu*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 提出一个三层次两阶段随机-鲁棒优化框架，用于联合规划可再生能源充电站选址和配电网扩展，考虑交通流量和人口密度，并区分决策依赖和决策独立的不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可再生能源充电站(RCSs)能提高可再生能源利用率和配电网效率，但其可变性和选址依赖的充电需求可能导致馈线过载，需要优化规划方法。

Method: 采用三层次两阶段随机-鲁棒优化框架：上层选择RCS站点和配电网扩展；中层调度电动汽车路由和充电；下层在决策独立不确定性最坏情况下最小化年度损耗成本。开发自适应不精确列约束生成算法求解。

Result: 在深圳47节点配电网和68枢纽交通网络的案例研究中，所提算法优于基准算法，光伏-电动汽车混合站具有成本最优性，RCS选址集中在变电站和高流量枢纽附近。

Conclusion: 该框架能有效解决RCS和配电网的协同规划问题，提出的A-iC&CG算法具有有限迭代收敛性，为可再生能源充电基础设施规划提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Renewable charging stations (RCSs) that co-locate electric-vehicle (EV) charging with distributed generation (DG) can raise renewable utilization and improve distribution-network (DN) efficiency, yet their variability and the siting-dependent charging demand can overload feeders if placed poorly. This paper proposes a tri-level, two-stage stochastic-robust optimization (SRO) co-planning framework that jointly determines RCS siting and DN expansion while accounting for transportation flows and population density. The model distinguishes two uncertainty classes: (i) decision-dependent uncertainty (DDU), under which EV charging loads vary with RCS siting; and (ii) decision-independent uncertainty (DIU), under which load fluctuations and renewable-generation variability do not depend on the RCS locations or the DN topology. At the upper level, the framework selects RCS sites and DN expansions. At the middle level, EV routing and charging are dispatched given the RCS siting to produce charging loads DDU. At the lower level, DN operation minimizes annualized loss costs under the worst-case DIU, reformulated via Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. To solve the resulting problem efficiently, we develop an adaptive inexact column-and-constraint generation (A-iC&CG) algorithm and prove finite-iteration convergence. Case studies on a 47-node DN coupled with a 68-hub transportation network in Shenzhen, China, show that A-iC&CG outperforms benchmark algorithms and that PV-EV hybrid stations are cost-optimal, with RCS siting concentrated near substations and high-flow hubs.

### [11] [Quantifying Distribution Shift in Traffic Signal Control with Histogram-Based GEH Distance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13785)
*Federico Taschin,Ozan K. Tonguz*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于GEH距离函数和需求直方图的交通信号控制分布偏移量化方法，该方法与策略无关、可解释，能有效预测性能下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 交通信号控制算法容易受到分布偏移的影响，在不同于训练条件的交通状况下性能会下降，需要一种量化方法来评估这种偏移。

Method: 将交通场景表示为需求直方图，使用GEH距离函数比较不同场景间的差异，该方法独立于控制策略，并利用交通工程中广泛使用的统计指标。

Result: 在20个模拟场景中验证，结果表明场景距离越大，旅行时间增加和吞吐量减少越明显，特别是对基于学习的控制器具有更强的解释力。

Conclusion: 该方法比现有技术能更好地预测分布偏移下的性能下降，为自适应交通信号控制的基准测试、训练方案设计和监控提供了实用框架。

Abstract: Traffic signal control algorithms are vulnerable to distribution shift, where performance degrades under traffic conditions that differ from those seen during design or training. This paper introduces a principled approach to quantify distribution shift by representing traffic scenarios as demand histograms and comparing them with a GEH-based distance function. The method is policy-independent, interpretable, and leverages a widely used traffic engineering statistic. We validate the approach on 20 simulated scenarios using both a NEMA actuated controller and a reinforcement learning controller (FRAP++). Results show that larger scenario distances consistently correspond to increased travel time and reduced throughput, with particularly strong explanatory power for learning-based control. Overall, this method can predict performance degradation under distribution shift better than previously published techniques. These findings highlight the utility of the proposed framework for benchmarking, training regime design, and monitoring in adaptive traffic signal control.

Abstract: Agentic AI systems have recently emerged as a critical and transformative approach in artificial intelligence, offering capabilities that extend far beyond traditional AI agents and contemporary generative AI models. This rapid evolution necessitates a clear conceptual and taxonomical understanding to differentiate this new paradigm. Our paper addresses this gap by providing a comprehensive review that establishes a precise definition and taxonomy for "agentic AI," with the aim of distinguishing it from previous AI paradigms. The concepts are gradually introduced, starting with a highlight of its diverse applications across the broader field of engineering. The paper then presents four detailed, state-of-the-art use case applications specifically within electrical engineering. These case studies demonstrate practical impact, ranging from an advanced agentic framework for streamlining complex power system studies and benchmarking to a novel system developed for survival analysis of dynamic pricing strategies in battery swapping stations. Finally, to ensure robust deployment, the paper provides detailed failure mode investigations. From these findings, we derive actionable recommendations for the design and implementation of safe, reliable, and accountable agentic AI systems, offering a critical resource for researchers and practitioners.

*William A Wheeler,Samuel Chevalier,Amritanshu Pandey*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 提出一个基于蒙特卡洛方法的变压器升级优先级框架，通过预测住宅供暖和交通电气化带来的负荷增长，计算变压器故障概率并优化升级计划。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 住宅供暖和交通电气化可能导致配电馈线中的变压器过载，需要战略性规划变压器升级以避免运行故障和供电短缺风险。

Method: 采用蒙特卡洛方法预测负荷，生成多个可能的负荷实例，收集每个变压器的故障概率分布。基于温度设定热泵负荷曲线，基于随机驾驶模型设定电动汽车充电曲线，结合网络拓扑和变压器故障模型计算故障概率。

Result: 在佛蒙特州农村实际配电馈线上测试，发现在20年模拟中，通常不到20%的变压器存在显著故障风险。

Conclusion: 开发了优化程序来安排变压器升级计划，并讨论了预期的故障数量，为配电系统应对电气化挑战提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Electrification of residential heating and transporta- tion has the potential to overload transformers in distribution feeders. Strategic scheduling of transformer upgrades to antici- pate increasing loads can avoid operational failures and reduce the risk of supply shortages. This work proposes a framework to prioritize transformer upgrades based on predicted loads at each meter, including heat pumps and electric vehicle chargers. The framework follows a Monte Carlo approach to forecasting, generating many possible loading instances and collecting a distribution of failure probabilities for each transformer. In each loading instance, heat pumps and EVs are added stochastically to each meter over time, based on an overall estimated growth rate and factors specific to each customer. We set heat pump load profiles by temperature and EV load profiles based on a stochastic driving model and charging pattern. The load profiles feed into network topology and transformer failure models to calculate failure probabilities.We formulate a cost optimization based on these failure probabilities to schedule transformer upgrades. We demonstrate this approach on a real-world distribution feeder in rural Vermont under low, medium, and high-electrification scenarios. We find generally less than 20% of transformers having substantial risk of failure over a 20-year simulation. Lastly, we develop an optimization routine to schedule upgrades and discuss the expected number of failures.

### [14] [Targeted Algorithmic Purpose-Driven Cyber Attacks in Distributed Multi-Agent Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13859)
*Mahan FakouriFard,Mingxi Liu*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 本文提出了一类新型的战略性目的驱动算法攻击，由参与代理发起并与分布式多代理优化(DMAO)交互，以实现自利的攻击目的。建立了这些攻击向量的理论基础，并通过电动汽车充电控制仿真验证了攻击效果。

Method: 开发了由参与代理发起的战略性目的驱动算法攻击，这些攻击与DMAO系统交互。在原始和对偶意义上建立了这些攻击向量的理论基础，包括具有和不具有隐蔽特性的攻击。

Result: 通过电动汽车充电控制仿真验证了所提算法攻击的有效性，并展示了此类攻击对配电网络的影响。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了分布式多代理优化系统面临的新型安全威胁，提出了目的驱动的算法攻击框架，为理解和防御此类针对性攻击提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Distributed multi-agent optimization (DMAO) enables the scalable control and coordination of a large population of edge resources in complex multi-agent environments. Despite its great scalability, DMAO is prone to cyber attacks as it relies on frequent peer-to-peer communications that are vulnerable to malicious data injection and alteration. Existing cybersecurity research mainly focuses on \emph{broad-spectrum} attacks that aim to jeopardize the overall environment but fail to sustainably achieve specific or targeted objectives. This paper develops a class of novel strategic purpose-driven algorithmic attacks that are launched by participating agents and interface with DMAO to achieve self-interested attacking purposes. Theoretical foundations, in both primal and dual senses, are established for these attack vectors with and without stealthy features. Simulations on electric vehicle charging control validate the efficacy of the proposed algorithmic attacks and show the impacts of such attacks on the power distribution network.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 该论文提出了两种数据驱动方法来估算住宅电动汽车充电曲线，使用来自休斯顿地区CenterPoint Energy的实际客户电表数据，为电力公司提供预测EV驱动需求增长的工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电动汽车的广泛采用给配电网络带来了新挑战，包括大规模局部负荷增加、随机充电行为和有限的数据可用性，需要开发有效的方法来估算充电曲线以支持电网规划。

Method: 第一种方法使用最小二乘估计，通过比较聚合的EV和非EV电表数据来提取平均充电速率；第二种方法从电表曲线中分离EV负荷，并应用核密度估计来开发概率充电模型。

Result: 两种方法都产生了独特的"U形"日充电曲线，显示大部分充电发生在夜间，验证后的曲线为电力公司提供了可扩展的工具。

Conclusion: 这些数据驱动方法能够帮助电力公司更好地预测EV驱动的需求增长，并支持主动的电网规划。

Abstract: Widespread electric vehicle (EV) adoption introduces new challenges for distribution grids due to large, localized load increases, stochastic charging behavior, and limited data availability. This paper proposes two data-driven methods to estimate residential EV charging profiles using real-world customer meter data from CenterPoint Energy serving the Houston area. The first approach applies a least-squares estimation to extract average charging rates by comparing aggregated EV and non-EV meter data, enabling a statistical method for starting and ending charge times. The second method isolates EV load from meter profiles and applies a kernel density estimation (KDE) to develop a probabilistic charging model. Both methods produce a distinct "u-shaped" daily charging profile, with most charging occurring overnight. The validated profiles offer a scalable tool for utilities to better anticipate EV-driven demand increases and support proactive grid planning.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 研究在控制器只能随机访问状态向量子集情况下的控制系统稳定性，提出基于LMI的算法来联合设计反馈增益矩阵和最小化测量状态坐标的随机稀疏化策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典控制理论假设控制器能访问完整状态测量，但实际应用中可能只能获取部分状态信息。本文研究随机稀疏化状态反馈下的系统稳定性问题。

Method: 使用渐近均方稳定性(AMSS)分析闭环系统，提出基于线性矩阵不等式(LMI)的算法来联合计算稳定增益矩阵和随机稀疏化策略，最小化期望测量状态坐标数。

Result: 建立了系统动态的条件，在该条件下可找到稀疏化策略；数值模拟显示在某些设置下，系统性能接近全状态反馈，但仅需测量0.3%的状态坐标。

Conclusion: 这是首个研究仅依赖随机选择状态测量的控制系统稳定性工作，证明了在极少量状态测量下仍能保持系统稳定性。

Abstract: While classical control theory assumes that the controller has access to measurements of the entire state (or output) at every time instant, this paper investigates a setting where the feedback controller can only access a randomly selected subset of the state vector at each time step. Due to the random sparsification that selects only a subset of the state components at each step, we analyze the stability of the closed-loop system in terms of Asymptotic Mean-Square Stability (AMSS), which ensures that the system state converges to zero in the mean-square sense. We consider the problem of designing both a feedback gain matrix and a measurement sparsification strategy that minimizes the number of state components required for feedback, while ensuring AMSS of the closed-loop system. Interestingly, (1) we provide conditions on the dynamics of the system under which it is possible to find a sparsification strategy, and (2) we propose a Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) based algorithm that jointly computes a stabilizing gain matrix, and a randomized sparsification strategy that minimizes the expected number of measured state coordinates while preserving the AMSS. Our approach is then extended to the case where the sparsification probabilities vary across the state components. Based on these theoretical findings, we propose an algorithmic procedure to compute the vector of sparsification parameters, along with the corresponding feedback gain matrix. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the stability properties of control systems that rely solely on randomly selected state measurements. Numerical simulations demonstrate that, in some settings, the system achieves comparable performance to full-state feedback while requiring measurements from only $0.3\%$ of the state coordinates.

Conclusion: 混合系统建模框架能够有效处理逆变器控制模式切换，提供稳定的动态性能和更优的状态估计精度。

Abstract: This paper develops a hybrid system modeling framework for inverters that switch between grid-following and grid-forming control schemes. In particular, such inverters are modeled as hybrid automata with guard conditions on voltage and frequency, and reset maps that maintain consistent phase, frequency, and droop references during mode transitions. The hybrid model is embedded within an extended Kalman filter to assess estimation performance under explicit mode switching. Results show that the proposed framework ensures stable, well-behaved dynamics and improves state estimation, especially near switching instants, compared with smooth continuous models.

Conclusion: 拥堵依赖的失衡定价机制能在满足电网约束的同时保持被动平衡激励，有效解决输配电网接口问题。

Abstract: Maintaining system balance becomes increasingly challenging as market design and grid capacity enhancement lag behind the growing share of renewables, requiring greater effort from both the transmission system operator (TSO) and the Balance Responsible Parties (BRPs). An actor can support balancing actively by bidding into reserve markets, or passively by adjusting its portfolio in line with system needs. In some countries, BRPs are incentivized to engage in passive balancing when their deviations support overall system stability. However, BRPs focus on profit maximization rather than minimizing portfolio discrepancies, which can cause simultaneous responses to price signals and create issues at the transmission-distribution interface. This research provides a two-stage stochastic model that captures BRP dynamic behavior and their impact on the grid under day-ahead and balancing market price uncertainty across three imbalance pricing mechanisms: the single, dual, and two-price. Then, a congestion-dependent imbalance pricing mechanism is proposed that maintains incentives for passive balancing while satisfying the grid constraint. A proof of concept is provided via the simulation with a part of the Dutch distribution grid. Results show that the proposed method mitigates the unexpected peak flow issue in congested areas while preserving passive balancing contributions from other BRPs in non-congested areas.

Conclusion: 所提出的L-函数框架为不确定非线性切换系统的集合吸引性分析提供了有效的构造性方法，在生物系统建模中具有实用价值。

Abstract: We introduce the class of L-functions to certify the attractivity of sets for uncertain nonlinear switched systems in discrete time. The existence of an L-function associated with a set guarantees the robust local attractivity of that set under the system dynamics. We propose a constructive method for obtaining piecewise-continuous L-functions based on contractive sets for the system, and show that the existence of a robust control contractive set for the dynamics implies the existence of an appropriate L-function, and hence the robust local attractivity of the set itself. We illustrate the proposed framework through examples that elucidate the theoretical concepts, and through the case study of a nonlinear switched system modelling antimicrobial resistance, which highlights the relevance of the approach to the analysis of biological systems.

Conclusion: 提出的方法成功实现了非线性异构智能体网络的分布式稳定性分析，在保证信息安全的同时降低了计算复杂度。

Abstract: Stabilizing large networks of nonlinear agents is challenging; decomposition and distributed analysis of these networks are crucial for computational tractability and information security. Vidyasagar's Network Dissipativity Theorem enables both properties concurrently in distributed network analysis. This paper explored combining it with the alternating direction methods of multipliers to develop distributed stability analysis for networks of inhomogeneous, nonlinear agents. One algorithm enhances information security by requiring agents to share only a dissipativity characterization, not a dynamical model, for stability analysis. A second algorithm further restricts this information sharing to their clique, thereby enhancing security, and can also reduce the computational burden of stability analysis if the network allows chordal decomposition. The convergence of the proposed algorithms is demonstrated, and criteria are identified for decomposable networks facilitating chordal decomposition. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is demonstrated through numerical examples involving a swarm of linearized unmanned aerial vehicles and networks beyond linear time-invariant agents.

Abstract: The emergence of large-scale multi-agent systems has led to controller synthesis methods for sparse communication between agents. However, most sparse controller synthesis algorithms remain centralized, requiring information exchange and high computational costs. This underscores the need for distributed algorithms that design controllers using only local dynamics information from each agent. This paper presents a consensus-based distributed stability analysis. The proposed stability analysis algorithms leverage Vidyasagar's Network Dissipativity Theorem and the alternating direction methods of multipliers to perform general stability analysis. Numerical examples involving a 2D swarm of unmanned aerial vehicles demonstrate the convergence of the proposed algorithms.

Abstract: Quantum technologies offer unprecedented capabilities in computation and secure information transfer. Their implementation requires qubits to operate at cryogenic temperatures (CT) while control and readout electronics typically still remains at room temperature (RT). As systems scale to millions of qubits, the electronics should also operate at CT to avoid a wiring bottleneck. However, wired power transfer from RT for such electronics introduces severe challenges, including thermal load between cooling stages, Joule heating, noise coupling, and wiring scalability. This paper addresses those challenges by evaluating several candidate architectures for scalable power transfer in the dilution frige: high-voltage (HV) wired power transfer, radiative wireless transfer, non-radiative wireless transfer, and a hybrid HV and non-radiative transfer. These architectures are analyzed in terms of thermal load, power loss, heating, coupling noise, power density, scalability, reliability, and complexity. Comparative analysis demonstrates the trade-offs among these architectures, while highlighting HV non-radiative transfer as a promising candidate for scalable quantum systems.

Abstract: Finding clear economic signals for distribution-network operation and expansion is increasingly important as single-phase loads and distributed energy resources escalate. These devices create phase-to-phase imbalances that manifest as voltage unbalance, a power quality issue that accelerates insulation aging in machines and increases network losses, thereby raising costs for operators and consumers. Traditional grid codes address unbalance via disparate hard limits on various indices thresholds that differ across standards, offer no dynamic economic incentive and undermine optimality. This paper proposes instead to treat voltage unbalance as a `soft limit' by adding penalty terms to grid operation costs within a three-phase optimal power flow to reflect the cost of the decrease in lifetime of assets due to being subject to voltage unbalance. This unified approach yields dynamic economic signals unbalance-aware Distribution Locational Marginal Prices (DLMP) that reflect the cost of power quality deviations. A novel mathematical decomposition of DLMP is developed, isolating the energy, loss, congestion, and unbalance components. Case studies conducted on two benchmark networks demonstrate the effectiveness and practical value of the proposed method. The results indicate that unbalance penalties reshape nodal prices, produce unexpected phase-level effects, and even allow scenarios where added load reduces unbalance and lowers costs, while providing planners and market designers with actionable insights to balance investment, operation, and power quality in modern distribution systems.

Abstract: Data centers host a variety of essential services such as cloud computing and artificial intelligence. Electric grid operators, however, have limited knowledge of the reliability risks of data center interconnection due to their unique operational characteristics. An emerging concern is the sub-synchronous resonance (SSR) which refer to unexpected voltage/current oscillations at typical frequencies below 60/50 Hz. It remains unknown whether and how the interactions between data centers and the grid may trigger resonances, equipment damages, and even cascading failures. In this paper, we focus on grid-connected data centers that draw electricity from the grid through power factor correction (PFC) converters. We conduct two-tone frequency sweep to investigate the data centers' impedance characteristics, i.e. magnitude and phase angle variations over frequencies, and showcase their deep dependence on compute workloads. The impedance modeling provides a direct approach to evaluating SSR risks and enable a cooperative mechanism to alarm and avoid resonance-prone situations. Building upon the impedance, a data-driven preventive controller is then established to raise early warnings of risky operation and suggest flexible workload management according to the given grid conditions. Through case study, we demonstrate how to use impedance to understand the unexpected interactions. Data-driven impedance is validated to show decent performance in capturing the unique impedance dips and tracking the impedance variations across a range of workload scenarios. The early warning and preventive control approaches are further effective to improve the safety margins with minimal workload rescheduling. The key findings of this work will provide valuable insights for grid operators and data center managers, and support preparation for future scenarios involving large-scale data center integration.

Result: 使用2.2 MWh、1.1 MW的特斯拉电池作为测试系统，在相同运营约束下实现了超过20%的经济回报改善。

Conclusion: 这种方法增强了能源套利中的决策能力，同时保持实用性、可扩展性，并且独立于特定的预测模型。

Abstract: This study examines the economic impact of post-hoc uncertainty discounting in predictive energy management, specifically in battery energy arbitrage. A 2.2 MWh, 1.1 MW Tesla battery, emulating operations at the University of Queensland's St. Lucia campus, is used as a test system. Traditionally, Model Predictive Control (MPC) frameworks rely on deterministic spot price forecasts from the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) to optimize battery scheduling. However, these forecasts lack uncertainty awareness, making arbitrage strategies vulnerable to extreme price volatility. To address this, we propose simple heuristic uncertainty discounting methods, which require no access to the predictive model's architecture or inputs. By integrating these strategies into existing MPC frameworks, we demonstrate a more than 20% improvement in economic returns under identical operational constraints. This approach enhances decision-making in energy arbitrage while remaining practical, scalable, and independent of specific forecasting models

Abstract: This work presents a case study of optimal energy management of a large Heating Ventilation and Cooling (HVAC) system within a university campus in Australia using Reinforcement Learning (RL). The HVAC system supplies to nine university buildings with an annual average electricity consumption of $\sim2$ GWh. Updated chiller Coefficient of Performance (COP) curves are identified, and a predictive building cooling demand model is developed using historical data from the HVAC system. Based on these inputs, a Proximal Policy Optimization based RL model is trained to optimally schedule the chillers in a receding horizon control framework with a priority reward function for constraint satisfaction. Compared to the traditional way of controlling the HVAC system based on a reactive rule-based method, the proposed controller saves up to 28\% of the electricity consumed by simply controlling the mass flow rates of the chiller banks and with minimal constraint violations.

Abstract: An increasing penetration of renewable energy resources, electric vehicle chargers, and energy storage systems into low-voltage power grids causes several power management and stability problems, such as reverse power flow, (local) overload lines, and over- / under-voltage. Previous power-flow and soft-open-point solutions are bulky and expensive. They need transformers and large magnetics, some on grid frequency, others more compact at high frequency. Even suggested circuits with high-frequency transformers still struggle with cost and size. We present a compact partial power-conversion high-current full-power-flow control circuit without a single transformer. We combine silicon and silicon-carbide, each with their specific advantages for current-dense direct injection. The circuit further needs fewer semiconductors than previous concepts. The circuit links a shunt converter through a non-isolated inverter bidirectionally with low-voltage series modules that practically float with their respective phases can serve between different feeders in low-voltage power grids. We analyze the circuit mathematically and evaluate the operation in simulation and experimental results.

Conclusion: 所提出的DOB控制策略成功解决了NLM与间接调制之间的冲突，实现了在SM数量较少情况下的完全解耦控制

Abstract: Nearest level modulation (NLM) is an attractive modulation method for its implementation simplicity in modular multilevel converter (MMC). However, it introduces significant voltage and current distortion when the number of submodules (SMs) per arm is small, as in medium-voltage applications. While indirect modulation offers fully decoupled control of ac-side current, dc-side current and SM capacitor energy, its performance is fundamentally reliant on accurate arm voltage synthesis, making it incompatible with the large quantization error inherent in NLM. To resolve this conflict, this paper proposes a new control strategy based on a disturbance observer (DOB). The key idea is to estimate and actively compensate for the inevitable arm voltage synthesis error induced by NLM, thereby enabling fully decoupled control of indirect-modulated MMC even under NLM operation with a small number of SMs. A key advantage is its ease of implementation, as it requires no modifications to the conventional NLM and decoupled control structure. The validity and effectiveness of the proposed method in improving current quality and decoupled SM energy control are verified through both simulation and experimental results.

By rigorously proving that the statistical distance between the Gaussian distribution and the truncated discrete one is negligible, the algorithm has the same security level as the standard CKKS cryptosystem. By utilizing the projection mapping on the estimates, the conditions for correct encryption and decryption are given. Based on these conditions, the stochastic approximation method is further employed to achieve the almost sure and mean square convergence of the algorithm. The effectiveness is demonstrated through a numerical example.

Abstract: We consider the optimal control of large-scale systems using distributed controllers with a network topology that mirrors the coupling graph between subsystems. In this work, we introduce spatial regret, a graph-informed metric that measures the worst-case performance gap between a distributed controller and an oracle which is assumed to have access to additional sensor information. The oracle's graph is a user-specified augmentation of the available information graph, resulting in a benchmark policy that highlights disturbances for which additional sensor information would significantly improve performance. Minimizing spatial regret yields distributed controllers-respecting the nominal information graph-that emulate the oracle's response to disturbances that are characteristic of large-scale networks, such as localized perturbations. We show that minimizing spatial regret admits a convex reformulation as an infinite program with a finite-dimensional approximation. To scale to large networks, we derive a computable upper bound on the spatial regret metric whose minimization problem can be solved in a distributed way. Numerical experiments on power-system models demonstrate that the resulting controllers mitigate localized disturbances more effectively than controllers optimized using classical metrics.

Motivation: 过度旅游对全球热门目的地构成严重挑战，威胁自然环境和当地社区，需要平衡经济、环境和社会三方面目标的可持续管理方案。

Method: 收集2008-2024年多源数据，建立包含游客行为、政府财政、环境演化和社会福祉四个模块的动态系统，使用NSGA-II算法优化累计净收入、最终环境指数和最终社会满意度三个目标。

Result: 在朱诺案例中，最优解可获得高达16.4亿美元的净收入，环境指数0.93，社会满意度0.86；冰岛案例显示帕累托前沿涵盖1.5-2亿美元收入，环境指数最高0.92，社会满意度超过0.80。

Abstract: Overtourism poses severe challenges to popular destinations worldwide, threatening natural environments and local communities. This paper develops a decision-making model integrating system dynamics with multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (NSGA-II) to balance economic returns, environmental protection, and social satisfaction. We collect multi-source data from 2008-2024 including visitor arrivals (up to 3.1M), government revenue/expenditure (up to $10.3M), glacier retreat (220-350 ft), CO2 emissions (77K-105K tons), and social satisfaction (0.29-0.48), and establish a dynamic system with four modules: tourist behavior, government finance, environmental evolution, and social well-being.
  We optimize three objectives via NSGA-II: cumulative net revenue, final environmental index, and final social satisfaction. Experiments on Juneau show optimal solutions yield net revenue up to $1.64B with environmental index 0.93 and social satisfaction 0.86. Extending to Iceland reveals Pareto fronts spanning revenues $150M-$200M, environment indices up to 0.92, and social satisfaction above 0.80.
  Sobol and Morris sensitivity analyses indicate carbon fees and price elasticity account for over 60% of environmental outcome variance, while capacity limits explain around 90% of net revenue variability. Scenario simulations demonstrate how capacity limits and dynamic pricing on crowded attractions, combined with marketing and infrastructure investment in lesser-known sites, mitigate congestion and enhance sustainability.
  This work contributes: (i) an integrated system-dynamics and NSGA-II framework for sustainable tourism management; (ii) demonstrated portability via case studies on Juneau and Iceland; and (iii) global sensitivity analysis highlighting influential policy levers for decision makers.

Abstract: Model Predictive Control (MPC) has established itself as the primary methodology for constrained control, enabling autonomy across diverse applications. While model fidelity is crucial in MPC, solving the corresponding optimization problem in real time remains challenging when combining long horizons with high-fidelity models that capture both short-term dynamics and long-term behavior. Motivated by results on the Exponential Decay of Sensitivities (EDS), which imply that, under certain conditions, the influence of modeling inaccuracies decreases exponentially along the prediction horizon, this paper proposes a multi-timescale MPC scheme for fast-sampled control. Tailored to systems with both fast and slow dynamics, the proposed approach improves computational efficiency by i) switching to a reduced model that captures only the slow, dominant dynamics and ii) exponentially increasing integration step sizes to progressively reduce model detail along the horizon. We evaluate the method on three practically motivated robotic control problems in simulation and observe speed-ups of up to an order of magnitude.

Main category: eess.SY

Conclusion: 该方法成功结合离线历史数据和在线实时数据，在无需系统辨识的情况下实现了时变线性系统的稳定控制，为鲁棒数据驱动控制提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Robust data-driven controllers typically rely on datasets from previous experiments, which embed information on the variability of the system parameters across past operational conditions. Complementarily, data collected online can contribute to improving the feedback performance relative to the current system's conditions, but are unable to account for the overall -- possibly time-varying -- system operation.
  With this in mind, we consider the problem of stabilizing a time-varying linear system, whose parameters are only known to lie within a bounded polytopic set. Taking a robust data-driven approach, we synthesize the control law by simultaneously leveraging two sets of historical state and input measures: an offline dataset -- which covers the extreme variations of the system parameters -- and an online dataset consisting of a rolling window of the latest state and input samples.
  Our approach relies on the data informativity framework: we thus relax persistent excitation requirements (i.e., the collected samples need not be sufficient for system identification), while still allowing for the design of a stabilizing controller. The state feedback law is obtained from standard Lyapunov arguments, implemented via semi-definite optimization: this also yields an upper bound on the cost-to-go for the class of systems that are consistent with the online data, while guaranteeing a decreasing cost for all systems compatible with the offline data. Numerical experiments are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller.

Abstract: Grid-connected power converters encounter significant stability challenges during weak grid faults, when conventional PI-based controllers exhibit an oscillatory response and poor fault-ride-through performance. This paper addresses this problem by replacing the conventional outer PI controllers that regulate DC-link and PCC voltages with an offset-free data-driven predictive controller. The developed algorithm leverages either pre-fault or fault-time data to construct input-output predictors, yielding offset-free control without the need for physics-based modelling. Simulation results show that pre-fault offset-free DPC doubles the critical equivalent grid impedance that can be handled and reduces the root mean squared error during faults by a factor of 40, while maintaining computation times comparable to conventional PI control. These findings demonstrate that the developed offset-free data predictive controller offers a simple, robust, and computationally efficient alternative to conventional control, significantly enhancing fault-ride-through capabilities of converters in weak grids.

Abstract: We present the design, fabrication, and measurement of a high-temperature superconductor (HTSC) Stepped Impedance Resonator (SIR) band-pass filter for S-band applications, and its incorporation into a cryogenic receiver cascade. The 11-pole filter, implemented in YBa2Cu3O(7-x) (YBCO) thin films on sapphire, exhibits an ultra-low insertion loss (IL) of -0.1~dB, a sharp roll-off of 100~MHz, and a rejection level exceeding --80~dB. These measured results represent, to the best of our knowledge, the lowest reported IL for an S-band filter with this number of poles. When integrated with a cryogenic low-noise amplifier (LNA), system-level simulations and measurements predict a receiver noise figure (NF) of 0.34~dB at 3.39~GHz, enabling a 20% increase in radar detection range compared with conventional copper-based front ends. This work demonstrates the feasibility of practical HTSC-based RF front-ends for next-generation communication and radar systems.

Abstract: Conventional high-altitude platforms (HAPs) face challenges in achieving continuous all-weather operation due to intermittent photovoltaic power generation, limited energy storage capacity, and high mission loads resulting from functional integration. To address this fundamental issue, we propose a stratospheric energy grid in which wireless power transfer (WPT) interconnections constitute the grid layer, while HAPs operate as dynamically reconfigurable integrated generation-grid-load-storage (IGGLS) nodes that harvest, buffer, consume, and peer-to-peer transfer energy for constellation-level balancing and resilience. In this system, each HAP node can flexibly switch among energy source, load, and storage roles according to its energy status and mission requirements, enabling energy exchange and spatiotemporal optimization within the stratosphere. Through cooperative scheduling, the stratospheric grid not only enables surplus-to-deficit energy support among HAPs but also extends upward to satellites and downward to the terrestrial grid and communication infrastructure, forming a heterogeneous, WPT-mediated interconnection. As an IGGLS ecosystem, it exploits peer-to-peer energy logistics, spatiotemporal smoothing of intermittency, cross-domain backup via the terrestrial grid, and service-aware dispatch, thereby boosting overall energy utilization and operational resilience. The proposed approach is validated through case studies, and we delineate an agenda of feasible research directions.

Conclusion: 该方法提供了递归可行性和渐近稳定性的理论保证，实现了高效的非线性系统鲁棒控制。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel Kernelized Data-Driven Predictive Control (KDPC) scheme for robust, offset-free tracking of nonlinear systems. Our computationally efficient hybrid approach separates the prediction: (1) kernel ridge regression learns the nonlinear map from past trajectories, and (2) analytical linearization of the kernel map approximates the effect of future inputs. This linearization is key, allowing the controller to be formulated as a standard Quadratic Program (QP) for efficient real-time implementation. Offset-free tracking is inherently achieved by using input increments. We provide theoretical guarantees for recursive feasibility and asymptotic stability. The algorithm is validated on a nonlinear Van der Pol oscillator, where it successfully rejects unmeasured disturbances and eliminates steady-state errors, outperforming a standard model-based controller.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DCOPF因其简单性和计算效率在电力系统操作中广泛使用，但其无损、忽略无功功率的模型在实际非线性ACPF场景下往往产生不可行调度。

Method: 使用四种DCOPF变体，通过分布式松弛分配和PV/PQ切换进行AC可行性恢复，构建统一的DCOPF-ACPF流程。

Result: 在13,659总线案例中，DCOPF与ACOPF之间的平均绝对误差和成本差异分别减少了75%和93%；极端负载条件下，不等式约束违规减少了3-5倍。

Conclusion: 结构化ACPF模型能够产生满足ACPF方程和所有工程不等式约束的解，该流程在恢复AC可行性方面非常有效。

Abstract: DC Optimal Power Flow (DCOPF) is widely utilized in power system operations due to its simplicity and computational efficiency. However, its lossless, reactive power-agnostic model often yields dispatches that are infeasible under practical operating scenarios such as the nonlinear AC power flow (ACPF) equations. While theoretical analysis demonstrates that DCOPF solutions are inherently AC-infeasible, their widespread industry adoption suggests substantial practical utility. This paper develops a unified DCOPF-ACPF pipeline to recover AC feasible solutions from DCOPF-based dispatches. The pipeline uses four DCOPF variants and applies AC feasibility recovery using both distributed slack allocation and PV/PQ switching. The main objective is to identify the most effective pipeline for restoring AC feasibility. Evaluation across over 10,000 dispatch scenarios on various test cases demonstrates that the structured ACPF model yields solutions that satisfy both the ACPF equations, and all engineering inequality constraints. In a 13,659 bus case, the mean absolute error and cost differences between DCOPF and ACOPF are reduced by 75% and 93%, respectively, compared to conventional single slack bus methods. Under extreme loading conditions, the pipeline reduces inequality constraint violations by a factor of 3 to 5.

Conclusion: 提出了分析LLM网络中幻觉传播的理论框架，为理解协作问答中的信息扩散机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: In this paper, we model and analyze how a network of interacting LLMs performs collaborative question-answering (CQA) in order to estimate a ground truth given a distributed set of documents. This problem is interesting because LLMs often hallucinate when direct evidence to answer a question is lacking, and these effects become more pronounced in a network of interacting LLMs. The hallucination spreads, causing previously accurate LLMs to hallucinate. We study interacting LLMs and their hallucination by combining novel ideas of mean-field dynamics (MFD) from network science and the randomized utility model from economics to construct a useful generative model. We model the LLM with a latent state that indicates if it is truthful or not with respect to the ground truth, and extend a tractable analytical model considering an MFD to model the diffusion of information in a directed network of LLMs. To specify the probabilities that govern the dynamics of the MFD, we propose a randomized utility model. For a network of LLMs, where each LLM has two possible latent states, we posit sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of a fixed point and analyze the behavior of the fixed point in terms of the incentive (e.g., test-time compute) given to individual LLMs. We experimentally study and analyze the behavior of a network of $100$ open-source LLMs with respect to data heterogeneity, node capability, network structure, and sensitivity to framing on multiple semi-synthetic datasets.

Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型和视觉语言模型在逻辑推理、问题解决和决策制定方面表现出色，但空间推理（包括心理旋转、导航和空间关系理解）仍然是当前先进VLMs的重大挑战。作者假设想象力（空间状态的内部模拟）是空间世界模型中的主导推理机制。

Conclusion: 本研究通过SpatiaLite基准描绘了先进VLMs的空间推理限制和模式，识别了关键缺陷，并为未来改进提供了指导。IDF框架展示了构建内部世界模型对提升VLMs空间推理能力的重要性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs), such as DeepSeek R1,OpenAI o3, and Gemini 2.5 Pro, have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities across logical inference, problem solving, and decision making. However, spatial reasoning:a fundamental component of human cognition that includes mental rotation, navigation, and spatial relationship comprehension remains a significant challenge for current advanced VLMs. We hypothesize that imagination, the internal simulation of spatial states, is the dominant reasoning mechanism within a spatial world model. To test this hypothesis and systematically probe current VLM spatial reasoning mechanisms, we introduce SpatiaLite, a fully synthetic benchmark that jointly measures spatial reasoning accuracy and reasoning efficiency. Comprehensive experiments reveal three key findings. First, advanced VLMs predominantly rely on linguistic representations for reasoning and imagination, resulting in significant deficiencies on visual centric tasks that demand perceptual spatial relations and 3D geometry transformations such as mental rotation or projection prediction. Second, advanced VLMs exhibit severe inefficiency in their current spatial reasoning mechanisms, with token usage growing rapidly as transformation complexity increases. Third, we propose an Imagery Driven Framework (IDF) for data synthesis and training, which can implicitly construct an internal world model that is critical for spatial reasoning in VLMs. Building on SpatiaLite, this work delineates the spatial reasoning limits and patterns of advanced VLMs, identifies key shortcomings, and informs future advances

Abstract: Microbial Fuel Cells (MFCs) offer a promising pathway for sustainable energy generation by converting organic matter into electricity through microbial processes. A key factor influencing MFC performance is the anode structure, where design and material properties play a crucial role. Existing predictive models struggle to capture the complex geometric dependencies necessary to optimize these structures. To solve this problem, we propose KANGURA: Kolmogorov-Arnold Network-Based Geometry-Aware Learning with Unified Representation Attention. KANGURA introduces a new approach to three-dimensional (3D) machine learning modeling. It formulates prediction as a function decomposition problem, where Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN)- based representation learning reconstructs geometric relationships without a conventional multi- layer perceptron (MLP). To refine spatial understanding, geometry-disentangled representation learning separates structural variations into interpretable components, while unified attention mechanisms dynamically enhance critical geometric regions. Experimental results demonstrate that KANGURA outperforms over 15 state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on the ModelNet40 benchmark dataset, achieving 92.7% accuracy, and excels in a real-world MFC anode structure problem with 97% accuracy. This establishes KANGURA as a robust framework for 3D geometric modeling, unlocking new possibilities for optimizing complex structures in advanced manufacturing and quality-driven engineering applications.

Method: 使用简单随机基因零基准测试评估KOSMOS在三个辐射生物学问题上的表现：DNA损伤反应能力预测p53转录反应、OGT和CDO1表达预测辐射响应模块强度、12基因特征预测前列腺癌放疗后生存。

Result: 假设1不支持（DDR评分与p53响应弱负相关）；OGT仅弱相关，CDO1是明确异常值；12基因特征一致性指数0.61但效应大小不唯一。

Conclusion: AI科学家能生成有用想法，但需要针对适当零模型进行严格审计，以区分真实发现与偶然结果。

Abstract: Agentic AI "scientists" now use language models to search the literature, run analyses, and generate hypotheses. We evaluate KOSMOS, an autonomous AI scientist, on three problems in radiation biology using simple random-gene null benchmarks. Hypothesis 1: baseline DNA damage response (DDR) capacity across cell lines predicts the p53 transcriptional response after irradiation (GSE30240). Hypothesis 2: baseline expression of OGT and CDO1 predicts the strength of repressed and induced radiation-response modules in breast cancer cells (GSE59732). Hypothesis 3: a 12-gene expression signature predicts biochemical recurrence-free survival after prostate radiotherapy plus androgen deprivation therapy (GSE116918). The DDR-p53 hypothesis was not supported: DDR score and p53 response were weakly negatively correlated (Spearman rho = -0.40, p = 0.76), indistinguishable from random five-gene scores. OGT showed only a weak association (r = 0.23, p = 0.34), whereas CDO1 was a clear outlier (r = 0.70, empirical p = 0.0039). The 12-gene signature achieved a concordance index of 0.61 (p = 0.017) but a non-unique effect size. Overall, KOSMOS produced one well-supported discovery, one plausible but uncertain result, and one false hypothesis, illustrating that AI scientists can generate useful ideas but require rigorous auditing against appropriate null models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bjøru等人的方法仅适用于马尔可夫模型，而半马尔可夫模型能表示更复杂的混杂关系，因此需要扩展该方法以处理更一般的因果模型。

Conclusion: 成功将反事实概率边界计算方法从马尔可夫模型扩展到半马尔可夫模型，为处理更复杂的混杂关系提供了解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, Bjøru et al. proposed a novel divide-and-conquer algorithm for bounding counterfactual probabilities in structural causal models (SCMs). They assumed that the SCMs were learned from purely observational data, leading to an imprecise characterization of the marginal distributions of exogenous variables. Their method leveraged the canonical representation of structural equations to decompose a general SCM with high-cardinality exogenous variables into a set of sub-models with low-cardinality exogenous variables. These sub-models had precise marginals over the exogenous variables and therefore admitted efficient exact inference. The aggregated results were used to bound counterfactual probabilities in the original model. The approach was developed for Markovian models, where each exogenous variable affects only a single endogenous variable. In this paper, we investigate extending the methodology to \textit{semi-Markovian} SCMs, where exogenous variables may influence multiple endogenous variables. Such models are capable of representing confounding relationships that Markovian models cannot. We illustrate the challenges of this extension using a minimal example, which motivates a set of alternative solution strategies. These strategies are evaluated both theoretically and through a computational study.

TL;DR: 本文系统分析了智能交通系统中大型视觉语言模型在精心设计的越狱攻击下的漏洞，提出了一种基于图像排版操纵和多轮提示的新型越狱攻击方法，并开发了多层响应过滤防御技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在多模态推理中表现出强大能力，但在智能交通系统应用中存在严重的安全漏洞，容易受到越狱攻击，可能导致模型生成有害内容。

Method: 构建了交通相关有害查询数据集；开发了结合图像排版操纵和多轮提示的新型越狱攻击方法；提出了多层响应过滤防御技术来阻止模型生成不当响应。

Result: 在开源和闭源的最先进LVLMs上进行了广泛实验，使用GPT-4判断和人工验证评估攻击和防御效果，发现图像排版操纵和多轮提示在ITS集成LVLMs中带来严重安全风险。

Conclusion: LVLMs在ITS应用中存在严重安全漏洞，需要有效的防御机制来防止越狱攻击，确保系统安全可靠运行。

Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in multimodal reasoning and many real-world applications, such as visual question answering. However, LVLMs are highly vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks. This paper systematically analyzes the vulnerabilities of LVLMs integrated in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) under carefully crafted jailbreaking attacks. First, we carefully construct a dataset with harmful queries relevant to transportation, following OpenAI's prohibited categories to which the LVLMs should not respond. Second, we introduce a novel jailbreaking attack that exploits the vulnerabilities of LVLMs through image typography manipulation and multi-turn prompting. Third, we propose a multi-layered response filtering defense technique to prevent the model from generating inappropriate responses. We perform extensive experiments with the proposed attack and defense on the state-of-the-art LVLMs (both open-source and closed-source). To evaluate the attack method and defense technique, we use GPT-4's judgment to determine the toxicity score of the generated responses, as well as manual verification. Further, we compare our proposed jailbreaking method with existing jailbreaking techniques and highlight severe security risks involved with jailbreaking attacks with image typography manipulation and multi-turn prompting in the LVLMs integrated in ITS.

### [48] [CORGI: Efficient Pattern Matching With Quadratic Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13942)
*Daniel Weitekamp*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CORGI是一种新的模式匹配算法，针对规则系统中指数级时间和空间复杂度的问题，提供二次时间和空间保证，能够迭代流式输出匹配结果而无需将整个冲突集存入内存。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实时AI系统和关系数据库查询需要解决复杂匹配问题，但传统方法在处理具有许多未约束变量的规则时可能面临指数级时间和空间需求，导致系统变慢或内存溢出。

Method: CORGI采用两步法：正向构建/维护基础关系图，反向通过迭代器按需生成匹配，避免传统RETE算法中β内存收集部分匹配的问题。

Result: 性能评估显示，在简单组合匹配任务中，CORGI显著优于SOAR和OPS5中的RETE实现。

Conclusion: CORGI算法通过消除高延迟延迟和内存溢出问题，使自动生成规则的系统在实际应用中更加可行。

Abstract: Rule-based systems must solve complex matching problems within tight time constraints to be effective in real-time applications, such as planning and reactive control for AI agents, as well as low-latency relational database querying. Pattern-matching systems can encounter issues where exponential time and space are required to find matches for rules with many underconstrained variables, or which produce combinatorial intermediate partial matches (but are otherwise well-constrained). When online AI systems automatically generate rules from example-driven induction or code synthesis, they can easily produce worst-case matching patterns that slow or halt program execution by exceeding available memory. In our own work with cognitive systems that learn from example, we've found that aggressive forms of anti-unification-based generalization can easily produce these circumstances. To make these systems practical without hand-engineering constraints or succumbing to unpredictable failure modes, we introduce a new matching algorithm called CORGI (Collection-Oriented Relational Graph Iteration). Unlike RETE-based approaches, CORGI offers quadratic time and space guarantees for finding single satisficing matches, and the ability to iteratively stream subsequent matches without committing entire conflict sets to memory. CORGI differs from RETE in that it does not have a traditional $β$-memory for collecting partial matches. Instead, CORGI takes a two-step approach: a graph of grounded relations is built/maintained in a forward pass, and an iterator generates matches as needed by working backward through the graph. This approach eliminates the high-latency delays and memory overflows that can result from populating full conflict sets. In a performance evaluation, we demonstrate that CORGI significantly outperforms RETE implementations from SOAR and OPS5 on a simple combinatorial matching task.

Motivation: 获取真实工作场所危险场景图像数据集困难，因为捕捉事故触发场景几乎不可能，需要生成逼真的危险场景图像来训练视觉模型。

Method: 使用GPT-4o分析OSHA叙述提取结构化危险推理，转换为对象级场景图，然后指导文本到图像扩散模型生成构图准确的危险场景，并通过VQA框架评估生成质量。

Result: 提出的VQA图分数在四个最先进的生成模型上优于CLIP和BLIP指标，基于熵验证确认其具有更高的判别敏感性。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效生成逼真的工作场所危险场景图像，为训练准确检测工作场所危险的视觉模型提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Training vision models to detect workplace hazards accurately requires realistic images of unsafe conditions that could lead to accidents. However, acquiring such datasets is difficult because capturing accident-triggering scenarios as they occur is nearly impossible. To overcome this limitation, this study presents a novel scene graph-guided generative AI framework that synthesizes photorealistic images of hazardous scenarios grounded in historical Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) accident reports. OSHA narratives are analyzed using GPT-4o to extract structured hazard reasoning, which is converted into object-level scene graphs capturing spatial and contextual relationships essential for understanding risk. These graphs guide a text-to-image diffusion model to generate compositionally accurate hazard scenes. To evaluate the realism and semantic fidelity of the generated data, a visual question answering (VQA) framework is introduced. Across four state-of-the-art generative models, the proposed VQA Graph Score outperforms CLIP and BLIP metrics based on entropy-based validation, confirming its higher discriminative sensitivity.

Abstract: This paper presents an integrative review and experimental validation of artificial intelligence (AI) agents applied to music analysis and education. We synthesize the historical evolution from rule-based models to contemporary approaches involving deep learning, multi-agent architectures, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) frameworks. The pedagogical implications are evaluated through a dual-case methodology: (1) the use of generative AI platforms in secondary education to foster analytical and creative skills; (2) the design of a multiagent system for symbolic music analysis, enabling modular, scalable, and explainable workflows.
  Experimental results demonstrate that AI agents effectively enhance musical pattern recognition, compositional parameterization, and educational feedback, outperforming traditional automated methods in terms of interpretability and adaptability. The findings highlight key challenges concerning transparency, cultural bias, and the definition of hybrid evaluation metrics, emphasizing the need for responsible deployment of AI in educational environments.
  This research contributes to a unified framework that bridges technical, pedagogical, and ethical considerations, offering evidence-based guidance for the design and application of intelligent agents in computational musicology and music education.

Motivation: 传统自适应学习系统诊断精确但干预薄弱，导致帮助时机不当或内容不匹配。需要建立诊断与教学之间的闭环，实现公平、负载感知的个性化教学。

Method: 将干预分配形式化为带约束的二元整数规划，包含覆盖度、时间、难度窗口、先决条件和反冗余约束。采用贪婪选择、梯度松弛和混合方法三种求解策略。

Result: 在1204名学生的物理课程部署中，两种求解器均能在有限观看时间内实现几乎所有学习者的完整技能覆盖。梯度方法比贪婪方法减少约12%的冗余覆盖，并协调难度分布。

Conclusion: 该方法构建了一个可追踪和可审计的控制器，闭合了诊断-教学循环，在课堂规模上实现了公平、负载感知的个性化教学。

Abstract: Adaptive learning often diagnoses precisely yet intervenes weakly, yielding help that is mistimed or misaligned. This study presents evidence supporting an instructor-governed feedback loop that converts concept-level assessment evidence into vetted micro-interventions. The adaptive learning algorithm contains three safeguards: adequacy as a hard guarantee of gap closure, attention as a budgeted constraint for time and redundancy, and diversity as protection against overfitting to a single resource. We formalize intervention assignment as a binary integer program with constraints for coverage, time, difficulty windows informed by ability estimates, prerequisites encoded by a concept matrix, and anti-redundancy enforced through diversity. Greedy selection serves low-richness and tight-latency regimes, gradient-based relaxation serves rich repositories, and a hybrid method transitions along a richness-latency frontier. In simulation and in an introductory physics deployment with one thousand two hundred four students, both solvers achieved full skill coverage for essentially all learners within bounded watch time. The gradient-based method reduced redundant coverage by approximately twelve percentage points relative to greedy and harmonized difficulty across slates, while greedy delivered comparable adequacy with lower computational cost in scarce settings. Slack variables localized missing content and supported targeted curation, sustaining sufficiency across subgroups. The result is a tractable and auditable controller that closes the diagnostic-pedagogical loop and delivers equitable, load-aware personalization at classroom scale.

TL;DR: ALEX是一个轻量级知识编辑框架，通过分层内存架构将知识更新组织成语义簇，将检索复杂度从O(N)降低到O(K+N/C)，显著提高了多跳问题的准确性和推理可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型中的知识是静态的，难以适应不断变化的信息，现有方法在处理需要多步推理的复杂多跳问题时面临可扩展性和检索效率的挑战。

Method: ALEX采用分层内存架构组织知识更新，包含推理查询合成模块来弥合查询与事实之间的语义差距，以及动态证据裁决引擎执行高效的两阶段检索过程。

Result: 在MQUAKE基准测试中，ALEX显著提高了多跳答案的准确性和推理路径的可靠性，同时将所需搜索空间减少了80%以上。

Conclusion: ALEX为构建可扩展、高效且准确的知识编辑系统提供了一条有前景的路径。

Abstract: The static nature of knowledge within Large Language Models (LLMs) makes it difficult for them to adapt to evolving information, rendering knowledge editing a critical task. However, existing methods struggle with challenges of scalability and retrieval efficiency, particularly when handling complex, multi-hop questions that require multi-step reasoning. To address these challenges, this paper introduces ALEX (A Light Editing-knowledge Extractor), a lightweight knowledge editing framework. The core innovation of ALEX is its hierarchical memory architecture, which organizes knowledge updates (edits) into semantic clusters. This design fundamentally reduces retrieval complexity from a linear O(N) to a highly scalable O(K+N/C). Furthermore, the framework integrates an Inferential Query Synthesis (IQS) module to bridge the semantic gap between queries and facts , and a Dynamic Evidence Adjudication (DEA) engine that executes an efficient two-stage retrieval process. Experiments on the MQUAKE benchmark demonstrate that ALEX significantly improves both the accuracy of multi-hop answers (MultiHop-ACC) and the reliability of reasoning paths (HopWise-ACC). It also reduces the required search space by over 80% , presenting a promising path toward building scalable, efficient, and accurate knowledge editing systems.

TL;DR: Syn-STARTS框架使用LLM生成大规模分类案例数据，解决了真实大规模伤亡事件数据难以获取的问题，生成的合成数据与人工整理的真实数据在质量上难以区分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模伤亡事件中的分类决策对提高受害者生存率至关重要，但这类事件发生频率低，难以积累足够的高质量真实数据用于AI模型开发和评估。

Method: 开发了Syn-STARTS框架，利用大语言模型生成分类案例，并与人工整理的TRIAGE开放数据集进行质量对比验证。

Result: Syn-STARTS生成的分类案例在质量上与人工整理的真实数据难以区分，且使用START标准分类方法评估时，LLM在绿、黄、红、黑四个类别的准确性表现高度稳定。

Conclusion: 合成数据在开发针对严重和危急医疗情境的高性能AI模型方面具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Triage is a critically important decision-making process in mass casualty incidents (MCIs) to maximize victim survival rates. While the role of AI in such situations is gaining attention for making optimal decisions within limited resources and time, its development and performance evaluation require benchmark datasets of sufficient quantity and quality. However, MCIs occur infrequently, and sufficient records are difficult to accumulate at the scene, making it challenging to collect large-scale realworld data for research use. Therefore, we developed Syn-STARTS, a framework that uses LLMs to generate triage cases, and verified its effectiveness. The results showed that the triage cases generated by Syn-STARTS were qualitatively indistinguishable from the TRIAGE open dataset generated by manual curation from training materials. Furthermore, when evaluating the LLM accuracy using hundreds of cases each from the green, yellow, red, and black categories defined by the standard triage method START, the results were found to be highly stable. This strongly indicates the possibility of synthetic data in developing high-performance AI models for severe and critical medical situations.

Conclusion: AISAC成功构建了一个可配置、透明且具有溯源能力的多智能体科学助手系统，通过模块化设计和配置驱动方法实现了跨领域科学应用的适应性。

Abstract: AI Scientific Assistant Core (AISAC) is an integrated multi-agent system developed at Argonne National Laboratory for scientific and engineering workflows. AISAC builds on established technologies - LangGraph for orchestration, FAISS for vector search, and SQLite for persistence - and integrates them into a unified system prototype focused on transparency, provenance tracking, and scientific adaptability.
  The system implements a Router-Planner-Coordinator workflow and an optional Evaluator role, using prompt-engineered agents coordinated via LangGraph's StateGraph and supported by helper agents such as a Researcher. Each role is defined through custom system prompts that enforce structured JSON outputs. A hybrid memory approach (FAISS + SQLite) enables both semantic retrieval and structured conversation history. An incremental indexing strategy based on file hashing minimizes redundant re-embedding when scientific corpora evolve. A configuration-driven project bootstrap layer allows research teams to customize tools, prompts, and data sources without modifying core code.
  All agent decisions, tool invocations, and retrievals are logged and visualized through a custom Gradio interface, providing step-by-step transparency for each reasoning episode. The authors have applied AISAC to multiple research areas at Argonne, including specialized deployments for waste-to-products research and energy process safety, as well as general-purpose scientific assistance, demonstrating its cross-domain applicability.

Result: 在RICO数据集上的实验结果表明，APD-agents达到了最先进的性能水平。

Conclusion: 该框架充分利用了大模型驱动的多智能体系统的自动协作能力，能够有效自动化移动应用页面设计过程。

Abstract: Layout design is a crucial step in developing mobile app pages. However, crafting satisfactory designs is time-intensive for designers: they need to consider which controls and content to present on the page, and then repeatedly adjust their size, position, and style for better aesthetics and structure. Although many design software can now help to perform these repetitive tasks, extensive training is needed to use them effectively. Moreover, collaborative design across app pages demands extra time to align standards and ensure consistent styling. In this work, we propose APD-agents, a large language model (LLM) driven multi-agent framework for automated page design in mobile applications. Our framework contains OrchestratorAgent, SemanticParserAgent, PrimaryLayoutAgent, TemplateRetrievalAgent, and RecursiveComponentAgent. Upon receiving the user's description of the page, the OrchestratorAgent can dynamically can direct other agents to accomplish users' design task. To be specific, the SemanticParserAgent is responsible for converting users' descriptions of page content into structured data. The PrimaryLayoutAgent can generate an initial coarse-grained layout of this page. The TemplateRetrievalAgent can fetch semantically relevant few-shot examples and enhance the quality of layout generation. Besides, a RecursiveComponentAgent can be used to decide how to recursively generate all the fine-grained sub-elements it contains for each element in the layout. Our work fully leverages the automatic collaboration capabilities of large-model-driven multi-agent systems. Experimental results on the RICO dataset show that our APD-agents achieve state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: With the rapid progress of large language models (LLMs), financial information retrieval has become a critical industrial application. Extracting task-relevant information from lengthy financial filings is essential for both operational and analytical decision-making. The FinAgentBench dataset formalizes this problem through two tasks: document ranking and chunk ranking. We present PRISM, a training-free framework that integrates refined system prompting, in-context learning (ICL), and a lightweight multi-agent system. Each component is examined extensively to reveal their synergies: prompt engineering provides precise task instructions, ICL supplies semantically relevant few-shot examples, and the multi-agent system models coordinated scoring behaviour. Our best configuration achieves an NDCG@5 of 0.71818 on the restricted validation split. We further demonstrate that PRISM is feasible and robust for production-scale financial retrieval. Its modular, inference-only design makes it practical for real-world use cases. The source code is released at https://bit.ly/prism-ailens.

Conclusion: R3框架通过整合LLM泛化能力和VLN专家知识，有效解决了VLN任务中的挑战，实现了性能的显著提升。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires an agent to dynamically explore complex 3D environments following human instructions. Recent research underscores the potential of harnessing large language models (LLMs) for VLN, given their commonsense knowledge and general reasoning capabilities. Despite their strengths, a substantial gap in task completion performance persists between LLM-based approaches and domain experts, as LLMs inherently struggle to comprehend real-world spatial correlations precisely. Additionally, introducing LLMs is accompanied with substantial computational cost and inference latency. To address these issues, we propose a novel dual-process thinking framework dubbed R3, integrating LLMs' generalization capabilities with VLN-specific expertise in a zero-shot manner. The framework comprises three core modules: Runner, Ruminator, and Regulator. The Runner is a lightweight transformer-based expert model that ensures efficient and accurate navigation under regular circumstances. The Ruminator employs a powerful multimodal LLM as the backbone and adopts chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to elicit structured reasoning. The Regulator monitors the navigation progress and controls the appropriate thinking mode according to three criteria, integrating Runner and Ruminator harmoniously. Experimental results illustrate that R3 significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, exceeding 3.28% and 3.30% in SPL and RGSPL respectively on the REVERIE benchmark. This pronounced enhancement highlights the effectiveness of our method in handling challenging VLN tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI代理基准测试主要关注任务完成准确率，但忽视了企业部署所需的成本效率、可靠性和运营稳定性等关键要求。

Method: 通过系统分析12个主要基准测试和对最先进代理的实证评估，提出CLEAR（成本、延迟、效能、保证、可靠性）整体评估框架。

Result: 在300个企业任务上评估6个领先代理，发现仅优化准确率的代理比成本感知替代方案贵4.4-10.8倍；专家评估确认CLEAR能更好预测生产成功率（ρ=0.83 vs 0.41）。

Conclusion: CLEAR框架为企业AI代理部署提供了更全面的评估标准，显著优于仅关注准确率的传统评估方法。

Abstract: Current agentic AI benchmarks predominantly evaluate task completion accuracy, while overlooking critical enterprise requirements such as cost-efficiency, reliability, and operational stability. Through systematic analysis of 12 main benchmarks and empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art agents, we identify three fundamental limitations: (1) absence of cost-controlled evaluation leading to 50x cost variations for similar precision, (2) inadequate reliability assessment where agent performance drops from 60\% (single run) to 25\% (8-run consistency), and (3) missing multidimensional metrics for security, latency, and policy compliance. We propose \textbf{CLEAR} (Cost, Latency, Efficacy, Assurance, Reliability), a holistic evaluation framework specifically designed for enterprise deployment. Evaluation of six leading agents on 300 enterprise tasks demonstrates that optimizing for accuracy alone yields agents 4.4-10.8x more expensive than cost-aware alternatives with comparable performance. Expert evaluation (N=15) confirms that CLEAR better predicts production success (correlation $ρ=0.83$) compared to accuracy-only evaluation ($ρ=0.41$).

Motivation: 5G和物联网驱动的现代通信网络中，传统集中式机器学习难以处理分布式数据和隐私问题，现有联邦学习方法成本高且泛化能力差。

Method: 提出HFL-FlowLLM框架，将大语言模型应用于异构联邦学习中的网络流量流分类。

Result: 相比最先进的异构联邦学习方法，平均F1分数提升约13%；相比现有大语言模型联邦学习框架，随着客户端数量增加，平均F1分数最多提升5%，训练成本降低约87%。

Conclusion: HFL-FlowLLM在现代通信网络安全中展现出巨大潜力和实用价值。

Abstract: In modern communication networks driven by 5G and the Internet of Things (IoT), effective network traffic flow classification is crucial for Quality of Service (QoS) management and security. Traditional centralized machine learning struggles with the distributed data and privacy concerns in these heterogeneous environments, while existing federated learning approaches suffer from high costs and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we propose HFL-FlowLLM, which to our knowledge is the first framework to apply large language models to network traffic flow classification in heterogeneous federated learning. Compared to state-of-the-art heterogeneous federated learning methods for network traffic flow classification, the proposed approach improves the average F1 score by approximately 13%, demonstrating compelling performance and strong robustness. When compared to existing large language models federated learning frameworks, as the number of clients participating in each training round increases, the proposed method achieves up to a 5% improvement in average F1 score while reducing the training costs by about 87%. These findings prove the potential and practical value of HFL-FlowLLM in modern communication networks security.

### [60] [Do Large Language Models (LLMs) Understand Chronology?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14214)
*Pattaraphon Kenny Wongchamcharoen,Paul Glasserman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs在金融应用中面临时间顺序理解问题，测试显示随着序列长度增加，准确率显著下降，但分配更多推理预算可改善性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试LLMs是否真正理解时间顺序，这对金融和经济应用至关重要，因为前瞻性偏见会影响模型判断。

Method: 设计三种时间顺序任务：时间排序、条件排序（先过滤后排序）和时代错误检测，在多个LLM上测试不同推理努力设置。

Result: GPT-5在中等/高推理努力下实现完美排序，但低推理努力时性能随序列长度增加而下降。条件排序失败主要源于过滤步骤而非排序步骤。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在时间顺序任务上存在局限，明确分配推理预算可显著改善性能，这对金融实时应用具有重要意义。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in finance and economics, where prompt-based attempts against look-ahead bias implicitly assume that models understand chronology. We test this fundamental question with a series of chronological ordering tasks with increasing complexities over facts the model already knows from pre-training. Our tasks cover (1) chronological ordering, (2) conditional sorting (filter, then order), and (3) anachronism detection. We evaluate GPT-4.1, Claude-3.7 Sonnet, with and without Extended Thinking (ET), and GPT-5 across multiple reasoning-effort settings. Across models, Exact match rate drops sharply as sequences lengthen even while rank correlations stay high as LLMs largely preserve local order but struggle to maintain a single globally consistent timeline. In conditional sorting, most failures stem from the filtering step rather than the ordering step, but GPT-5 and Claude-3.7 Sonnet with Extended Thinking outshine normal models significantly. Lastly, anachronism detection is found to be the easiest task for the LLMs but performance still declines with increasingly overlapping timelines or entities. Overall, our main contribution is showing that allocating explicit reasoning budget helps with chronological ordering with GPT-5 at medium/high reasoning effort achieving flawless ordering at all lengths and perfect conditional sorting (both self-filtered and given-subset), whereas low/minimal effort degrades with longer lists, mirroring earlier models. Our findings delineate limits of current LLMs on chronological tasks, providing insights into task complexity, and demonstrate scenarios in which reasoning helps. These patterns are important for the real-time application of LLMs in finance. We release all code and evaluation templates to support full reproducibility.

TL;DR: 提出两阶段架构来减少Whisper模型的幻觉错误：第一阶段通过自适应层注意力增强编码器鲁棒性，第二阶段使用多目标知识蒸馏框架抑制幻觉


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Whisper模型在嘈杂声学条件下经常出现幻觉错误，而先前工作主要关注音频预处理或转录后处理，对模型本身的修改探索不足

Method: 1. 自适应层注意力：通过层间相关性分析将编码器层分组为语义连贯块，使用可学习多头注意力融合块表示；2. 多目标知识蒸馏：在嘈杂音频上训练学生模型，使其语义和注意力分布与处理干净输入的教师模型对齐

Result: 在嘈杂语音基准测试中显著减少了幻觉和词错误率，同时保持了在干净语音上的性能

Conclusion: ALA和KD共同提供了一个原则性策略，可在真实世界嘈杂条件下提高Whisper的可靠性

Abstract: The Whisper model, an open-source automatic speech recognition system, is widely adopted for its strong performance across multilingual and zero-shot settings. However, it frequently suffers from hallucination errors, especially under noisy acoustic conditions. Previous works to reduce hallucinations in Whisper-style ASR systems have primarily focused on audio preprocessing or post-processing of transcriptions to filter out erroneous content. However, modifications to the Whisper model itself remain largely unexplored to mitigate hallucinations directly. To address this challenge, we present a two-stage architecture that first enhances encoder robustness through Adaptive Layer Attention (ALA) and further suppresses hallucinations using a multi-objective knowledge distillation (KD) framework. In the first stage, ALA groups encoder layers into semantically coherent blocks via inter-layer correlation analysis. A learnable multi-head attention module then fuses these block representations, enabling the model to jointly exploit low- and high-level features for more robust encoding. In the second stage, our KD framework trains the student model on noisy audio to align its semantic and attention distributions with a teacher model processing clean inputs. Our experiments on noisy speech benchmarks show notable reductions in hallucinations and word error rates, while preserving performance on clean speech. Together, ALA and KD offer a principled strategy to improve Whisper's reliability under real-world noisy conditions.

Abstract: Operation recommendation for IoT devices refers to generating personalized device operations for users based on their context, such as historical operations, environment information, and device status. This task is crucial for enhancing user satisfaction and corporate profits. Existing recommendation models struggle with complex operation logic, diverse user preferences, and sensitive to suboptimal suggestions, limiting their applicability to IoT device operations. To address these issues, we propose DevPiolt, a LLM-based recommendation model for IoT device operations. Specifically, we first equip the LLM with fundamental domain knowledge of IoT operations via continual pre-training and multi-task fine-tuning. Then, we employ direct preference optimization to align the fine-tuned LLM with specific user preferences. Finally, we design a confidence-based exposure control mechanism to avoid negative user experiences from low-quality recommendations. Extensive experiments show that DevPiolt significantly outperforms baselines on all datasets, with an average improvement of 69.5% across all metrics. DevPiolt has been practically deployed in Xiaomi Home app for one quarter, providing daily operation recommendations to 255,000 users. Online experiment results indicate a 21.6% increase in unique visitor device coverage and a 29.1% increase in page view acceptance rates.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的时间序列预测框架，用于预测区域级Airbnb市场的三个关键指标：收入、预订天数和预订数量，通过整合房源特征与外部环境因素构建区域表示，并使用LLM生成区域嵌入，最终通过时间序列模型进行预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 短期租赁平台（如Airbnb）的扩张严重扰乱了当地住房市场，导致租金上涨和住房负担能力问题。准确预测区域Airbnb市场趋势可以为政策制定者和城市规划者提供关键见解，以减轻这些影响。

Method: 采用滑动窗口方法预测1-3个月的趋势，通过整合房源特征与外部环境因素（如城市可达性和人类流动性）构建区域表示，将结构化表格数据转换为基于提示的LLM输入以生成综合区域嵌入，然后将这些嵌入输入到高级时间序列模型（RNN、LSTM、Transformer）中。

Result: 在首尔Airbnb数据集上的实验表明，该方法相比传统统计和机器学习基线，平均RMSE和MAE降低了约48%。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅提高了预测准确性，还为检测供应过剩区域和支持数据驱动的城市政策决策提供了实用见解。

Abstract: The expansion of short-term rental platforms, such as Airbnb, has significantly disrupted local housing markets, often leading to increased rental prices and housing affordability issues. Accurately forecasting regional Airbnb market trends can thus offer critical insights for policymakers and urban planners aiming to mitigate these impacts. This study proposes a novel time-series forecasting framework to predict three key Airbnb indicators -- Revenue, Reservation Days, and Number of Reservations -- at the regional level. Using a sliding-window approach, the model forecasts trends 1 to 3 months ahead. Unlike prior studies that focus on individual listings at fixed time points, our approach constructs regional representations by integrating listing features with external contextual factors such as urban accessibility and human mobility. We convert structured tabular data into prompt-based inputs for a Large Language Model (LLM), producing comprehensive regional embeddings. These embeddings are then fed into advanced time-series models (RNN, LSTM, Transformer) to better capture complex spatio-temporal dynamics. Experiments on Seoul's Airbnb dataset show that our method reduces both average RMSE and MAE by approximately 48% compared to conventional baselines, including traditional statistical and machine learning models. Our framework not only improves forecasting accuracy but also offers practical insights for detecting oversupplied regions and supporting data-driven urban policy decisions.

TL;DR: PathMind是一个新颖的知识图谱推理框架，通过选择性引导LLM使用重要推理路径来增强忠实和可解释的推理。它采用"检索-优先-推理"范式，包含路径优先级机制和双阶段训练策略，在复杂推理任务上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有LLM-based知识图谱推理方法的两个关键限制：1) 无差别提取推理路径可能引入不相关噪声误导LLM；2) 动态探索推理路径需要高检索需求和频繁LLM调用。

Method: 采用"检索-优先-推理"范式：1) 检索模块从KG中检索查询子图；2) 路径优先级机制使用语义感知路径优先级函数识别重要推理路径；3) 通过任务特定指令调优和路径偏好对齐的双阶段训练策略生成准确响应。

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，PathMind始终优于竞争基线，特别是在需要较少输入标记的复杂推理任务中，通过识别基本推理路径实现更好性能。

Conclusion: PathMind通过选择性引导LLM使用重要推理路径，有效提升了知识图谱推理的准确性和效率，为复杂推理任务提供了可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Knowledge graph reasoning (KGR) is the task of inferring new knowledge by performing logical deductions on knowledge graphs. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in complex reasoning tasks. Despite promising success, current LLM-based KGR methods still face two critical limitations. First, existing methods often extract reasoning paths indiscriminately, without assessing their different importance, which may introduce irrelevant noise that misleads LLMs. Second, while many methods leverage LLMs to dynamically explore potential reasoning paths, they require high retrieval demands and frequent LLM calls. To address these limitations, we propose PathMind, a novel framework designed to enhance faithful and interpretable reasoning by selectively guiding LLMs with important reasoning paths. Specifically, PathMind follows a "Retrieve-Prioritize-Reason" paradigm. First, it retrieves a query subgraph from KG through the retrieval module. Next, it introduces a path prioritization mechanism that identifies important reasoning paths using a semantic-aware path priority function, which simultaneously considers the accumulative cost and the estimated future cost for reaching the target. Finally, PathMind generates accurate and logically consistent responses via a dual-phase training strategy, including task-specific instruction tuning and path-wise preference alignment. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that PathMind consistently outperforms competitive baselines, particularly on complex reasoning tasks with fewer input tokens, by identifying essential reasoning paths.

Motivation: 当前LLM驱动的数据洞察代理存在三个主要限制：领域知识利用不足、分析深度浅、代码生成易出错，导致无法提供满意的洞察发现结果。

Method: 提出DataSage框架，包含三个创新特性：外部知识检索丰富分析上下文、多角色辩论机制模拟多样化分析视角、多路径推理提高代码和洞察生成的准确性。

Result: 在InsightBench上的广泛实验表明，DataSage在所有难度级别上都持续优于现有的数据洞察代理。

Conclusion: DataSage为自动化数据洞察发现提供了一个有效的解决方案。

Abstract: In today's data-driven era, fully automated end-to-end data analytics, particularly insight discovery, is critical for discovering actionable insights that assist organizations in making effective decisions. With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), LLM-driven agents have emerged as a promising paradigm for automating data analysis and insight discovery. However, existing data insight agents remain limited in several key aspects, often failing to deliver satisfactory results due to: (1) insufficient utilization of domain knowledge, (2) shallow analytical depth, and (3) error-prone code generation during insight generation. To address these issues, we propose DataSage, a novel multi-agent framework that incorporates three innovative features including external knowledge retrieval to enrich the analytical context, a multi-role debating mechanism to simulate diverse analytical perspectives and deepen analytical depth, and multi-path reasoning to improve the accuracy of the generated code and insights. Extensive experiments on InsightBench demonstrate that DataSage consistently outperforms existing data insight agents across all difficulty levels, offering an effective solution for automated data insight discovery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检验LLMs在自动生成优化模型时是否真正具备推理能力，而非仅仅依赖训练数据中的标准问题。

Method: 系统性地重新表述和扰动CSPLib问题，保持结构不变但改变上下文并引入误导元素，比较三个代表性LLM在原始和修改描述下的模型生成表现。

Result: LLMs能生成语法有效且语义合理的模型，但在上下文和语言变化下性能急剧下降，显示出浅层理解和对措辞的敏感性。

Conclusion: LLMs在优化和约束编程领域的模型生成能力主要源于数据污染而非真正的推理能力，对语言变化缺乏鲁棒性。

Abstract: One of the long-standing goals in optimisation and constraint programming is to describe a problem in natural language and automatically obtain an executable, efficient model. Large language models appear to bring this vision closer, showing impressive results in automatically generating models for classical benchmarks. However, much of this apparent success may derive from data contamination rather than genuine reasoning: many standard CP problems are likely included in the training data of these models. To examine this hypothesis, we systematically rephrased and perturbed a set of well-known CSPLib problems to preserve their structure while modifying their context and introducing misleading elements. We then compared the models produced by three representative LLMs across original and modified descriptions. Our qualitative analysis shows that while LLMs can produce syntactically valid and semantically plausible models, their performance drops sharply under contextual and linguistic variation, revealing shallow understanding and sensitivity to wording.

Motivation: 当前LLM的对齐决策往往忽视人类社会的多样性，本研究旨在探索融入多元价值观如何影响LLM的行为表现。

Method: 收集美德两国参与者对LLM回复的评分，涉及毒性、情感意识、敏感性、刻板偏见和帮助性五个维度。通过不同社会群体的偏好微调多个大语言模型和大推理模型，并比较不同评分尺度、分歧处理方法和优化技术。

Result: 发现系统性人口统计效应：男性参与者评分毒性低18%；保守派和黑人参与者评分情感意识分别高27.9%和44%。技术设计选择影响显著：保留评分者分歧比多数投票毒性减少53%；5点量表比二元格式减少22%；DPO在多值优化中优于GRPO。

Conclusion: 这些发现为回答关键问题提供了初步步骤：对齐过程应如何平衡专家驱动和用户驱动信号，以确保安全性和公平代表性。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained using human feedback for safety and alignment with human values, alignment decisions often overlook human social diversity. This study examines how incorporating pluralistic values affects LLM behavior by systematically evaluating demographic variation and design parameters in the alignment pipeline. We collected alignment data from US and German participants (N = 1,095, 27,375 ratings) who rated LLM responses across five dimensions: Toxicity, Emotional Awareness (EA), Sensitivity, Stereotypical Bias, and Helpfulness. We fine-tuned multiple Large Language Models and Large Reasoning Models using preferences from different social groups while varying rating scales, disagreement handling methods, and optimization techniques. The results revealed systematic demographic effects: male participants rated responses 18% less toxic than female participants; conservative and Black participants rated responses 27.9% and 44% more emotionally aware than liberal and White participants, respectively. Models fine-tuned on group-specific preferences exhibited distinct behaviors. Technical design choices showed strong effects: the preservation of rater disagreement achieved roughly 53% greater toxicity reduction than majority voting, and 5-point scales yielded about 22% more reduction than binary formats; and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) consistently outperformed Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) in multi-value optimization. These findings represent a preliminary step in answering a critical question: How should alignment balance expert-driven and user-driven signals to ensure both safety and fair representation?

Result: 在桌面机器人操作任务中，处理10,047个PyBullet生成场景，输出校准置信度的概率谓词（F1=0.68），在Simple Stack、Deep Stack和Clear+Stack基准测试中分别达到94%/90%/88%成功率，比最强POMDP基线提高10-14个百分点，规划时间在15ms内。

Conclusion: 该框架建立了校准不确定性与规划收敛之间的定量联系，提供了理论保证，可应用于任何需要从感知输入到符号规划的不确定性感知推理的领域。

Abstract: Bridging continuous perceptual signals and discrete symbolic reasoning is a fundamental challenge in AI systems that must operate under uncertainty. We present a neuro-symbolic framework that explicitly models and propagates uncertainty from perception to planning, providing a principled connection between these two abstraction levels. Our approach couples a transformer-based perceptual front-end with graph neural network (GNN) relational reasoning to extract probabilistic symbolic states from visual observations, and an uncertainty-aware symbolic planner that actively gathers information when confidence is low. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness on tabletop robotic manipulation as a concrete application: the translator processes 10,047 PyBullet-generated scenes (3--10 objects) and outputs probabilistic predicates with calibrated confidences (overall F1=0.68). When embedded in the planner, the system achieves 94\%/90\%/88\% success on Simple Stack, Deep Stack, and Clear+Stack benchmarks (90.7\% average), exceeding the strongest POMDP baseline by 10--14 points while planning within 15\,ms. A probabilistic graphical-model analysis establishes a quantitative link between calibrated uncertainty and planning convergence, providing theoretical guarantees that are validated empirically. The framework is general-purpose and can be applied to any domain requiring uncertainty-aware reasoning from perceptual input to symbolic planning.

Conclusion: 为个性化教育和AI辅助教育中的信息论知识图谱优化建立了理论基础

Abstract: Task-oriented knowledge graphs (KGs) enable AI-powered learning assistant systems to automatically generate high-quality multiple-choice questions (MCQs). Yet converting unstructured educational materials, such as lecture notes and slides, into KGs that capture key pedagogical content remains difficult. We propose a framework for knowledge graph construction and refinement grounded in rate-distortion (RD) theory and optimal transport geometry. In the framework, lecture content is modeled as a metric-measure space, capturing semantic and relational structure, while candidate KGs are aligned using Fused Gromov-Wasserstein (FGW) couplings to quantify semantic distortion. The rate term, expressed via the size of KG, reflects complexity and compactness. Refinement operators (add, merge, split, remove, rewire) minimize the rate-distortion Lagrangian, yielding compact, information-preserving KGs. Our prototype applied to data science lectures yields interpretable RD curves and shows that MCQs generated from refined KGs consistently surpass those from raw notes on fifteen quality criteria. This study establishes a principled foundation for information-theoretic KG optimization in personalized and AI-assisted education.

Result: 在多样化代理任务上的实验表明，AutoTool将推理成本降低高达30%，同时保持竞争力的任务完成率。

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了将统计结构集成到LLM代理设计中的潜力，可以在不牺牲性能的情况下实现更高的效率。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have emerged as powerful tools for automating complex tasks by leveraging the reasoning and decision-making abilities of LLMs. However, a major bottleneck in current agent frameworks lies in the high inference cost of tool selection, especially in approaches like ReAct that repeatedly invoke the LLM to determine which tool to use at each step. In this work, we propose AutoTool, a novel graph-based framework that bypasses repeated LLM inference by exploiting a key empirical observation: tool usage inertia - the tendency of tool invocations to follow predictable sequential patterns. AutoTool constructs a directed graph from historical agent trajectories, where nodes represent tools and edges capture transition probabilities, effectively modeling the inertia in tool selection. It further integrates parameter-level information to refine tool input generation. By traversing this structured representation, AutoTool efficiently selects tools and their parameters with minimal reliance on LLM inference. Extensive experiments across diverse agent tasks demonstrate that AutoTool reduces inference costs by up to 30% while maintaining competitive task completion rates, offering a practical and scalable enhancement for inference-heavy frameworks. Our work highlights the promise of integrating statistical structure into LLM agent design for greater efficiency without sacrificing performance.

Motivation: 现有ICL方法在顺序决策任务中难以同时满足三个关键原则：关注决策关键信息、提供步骤级粒度、最小化专家标注依赖。

Method: 构建动作中心的领域级图，通过时间差分信用分配识别高效用动作，检索步骤级技能来生成细粒度的上下文感知提示。

Conclusion: SkillGen通过关注高效用片段支持任务可识别性，为更有效的ICL提示设计提供了理论基础和实践验证。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to sequential decision-making through in-context learning (ICL), yet their effectiveness is highly sensitive to prompt quality. Effective prompts should meet three principles: focus on decision-critical information, provide step-level granularity, and minimize reliance on expert annotations through label efficiency. However, existing ICL methods often fail to satisfy all three criteria simultaneously. Motivated by these challenges, we introduce SkillGen, a skill-based ICL framework for structured sequential reasoning. It constructs an action-centric, domain-level graph from sampled trajectories, identifies high-utility actions via temporal-difference credit assignment, and retrieves step-wise skills to generate fine-grained, context-aware prompts. We further present a theoretical analysis showing that focusing on high-utility segments supports task identifiability and informs more effective ICL prompt design. Experiments on ALFWorld, BabyAI, and ScienceWorld, using both open-source and proprietary LLMs, show that SkillGen achieves consistent gains, improving progress rate by 5.9%-16.5% on average across models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 配电网大规模停电后的恢复需要处理非线性约束下的顺序开关操作和分布式能源协调，传统优化方法和基于值的强化学习方法计算效率低且难以扩展。

Method: 采用异构智能体强化学习框架，通过HAPPO算法训练去中心化的执行器策略，使用集中式评论家计算优势值进行稳定策略更新，在OpenDSS物理环境中通过可微分惩罚信号强制执行操作限制。

Result: 在IEEE 123总线和IEEE 8500节点系统上的实验表明，HAPPO相比DQN、PPO、MAES等算法具有更快的收敛速度、更高的恢复功率和更平滑的多种子训练效果。

Conclusion: 在HARL框架中引入微电网级别的异构性，为复杂配电网恢复问题提供了可扩展、稳定且约束感知的解决方案。

Abstract: Restoring power distribution systems (PDS) after large-scale outages requires sequential switching operations that reconfigure feeder topology and coordinate distributed energy resources (DERs) under nonlinear constraints such as power balance, voltage limits, and thermal ratings. These challenges make conventional optimization and value-based RL approaches computationally inefficient and difficult to scale. This paper applies a Heterogeneous-Agent Reinforcement Learning (HARL) framework, instantiated through Heterogeneous-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (HAPPO), to enable coordinated restoration across interconnected microgrids. Each agent controls a distinct microgrid with different loads, DER capacities, and switch counts, introducing practical structural heterogeneity. Decentralized actor policies are trained with a centralized critic to compute advantage values for stable on-policy updates. A physics-informed OpenDSS environment provides full power flow feedback and enforces operational limits via differentiable penalty signals rather than invalid action masking. The total DER generation is capped at 2400 kW, and each microgrid must satisfy local supply-demand feasibility. Experiments on the IEEE 123-bus and IEEE 8500-node systems show that HAPPO achieves faster convergence, higher restored power, and smoother multi-seed training than DQN, PPO, MAES, MAGDPG, MADQN, Mean-Field RL, and QMIX. Results demonstrate that incorporating microgrid-level heterogeneity within the HARL framework yields a scalable, stable, and constraint-aware solution for complex PDS restoration.

### [73] [Modeling Fairness in Recruitment AI via Information Flow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13793)
*Mattias Brännström,Themis Dimitra Xanthopoulou,Lili Jiang*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 本文应用信息流建模框架分析真实招聘流程中的AI决策公平性，识别偏见产生和传播路径


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么关注技术层面，要么关注社会伦理层面，很少捕捉两者在实际中的交互作用。需要理解AI支持决策的现实后果以避免偏见和分配责任

Method: 采用信息流建模框架，通过半结构化利益相关者访谈和迭代建模，构建招聘流程的多层次表示，捕捉算法和人类组件中信息的转换、过滤和解释

Result: 识别了偏见可能出现的环节、如何在系统中传播以及对候选人的下游影响

Conclusion: 信息流建模可以支持对公平风险的结构化分析，在复杂社会技术系统中提供透明度

Abstract: Avoiding bias and understanding the real-world consequences of AI-supported decision-making are critical to address fairness and assign accountability. Existing approaches often focus either on technical aspects, such as datasets and models, or on high-level socio-ethical considerations - rarely capturing how these elements interact in practice. In this paper, we apply an information flow-based modeling framework to a real-world recruitment process that integrates automated candidate matching with human decision-making. Through semi-structured stakeholder interviews and iterative modeling, we construct a multi-level representation of the recruitment pipeline, capturing how information is transformed, filtered, and interpreted across both algorithmic and human components. We identify where biases may emerge, how they can propagate through the system, and what downstream impacts they may have on candidates. This case study illustrates how information flow modeling can support structured analysis of fairness risks, providing transparency across complex socio-technical systems.

TL;DR: AI写作工具在Change.org平台上的集成显著改变了请愿书的词汇特征并增加了内容同质性，但未能改善请愿结果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究AI写作工具在社交媒体平台上对内容生产和结果的实际影响，特别是其是否真正改善期望的结果

Method: 利用Change.org平台的"write with AI"工具作为自然实验，收集150万份请愿书，采用双重差分分析方法，并对重复请愿作者进行单独分析

Result: AI访问显著改变了请愿书的词汇特征，增加了内容同质性，但未能改善请愿结果

Conclusion: AI写作工具能深刻重塑在线内容，但其改善期望结果的实用性可能不如预期，并会带来内容同质化等意外后果

Abstract: The rapid integration of AI writing tools into online platforms raises critical questions about their impact on content production and outcomes. We leverage a unique natural experiment on Change.org, a leading social advocacy platform, to causally investigate the effects of an in-platform ''write with AI'' tool. To understand the impact of the AI integration, we collected 1.5 million petitions and employed a difference-in-differences analysis. Our findings reveal that in-platform AI access significantly altered the lexical features of petitions and increased petition homogeneity, but did not improve petition outcomes. We confirmed the results in a separate analysis of repeat petition writers who wrote petitions before and after introduction of the AI tool. The results suggest that while AI writing tools can profoundly reshape online content, their practical utility for improving desired outcomes may be less beneficial than anticipated, and introduce unintended consequences like content homogenization.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: AI在制造和材料科学中主要用于建模和设计空间搜索，能节省成本和时间，但在数据稀疏区域不可靠，需要与传统方法结合使用，可能阻碍颠覆性理论突破。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI被寄予加速科技创新的厚望，但缺乏对AI在创新过程中实际应用的详细研究，需要了解AI如何及在多大程度上能加速创新。

Method: 对美国32位有AI/ML经验的制造和材料科学学术研究人员进行访谈。

Result: 受访者主要使用AI进行材料和制造过程建模，实现更便宜快速的设计空间搜索，节省成本、时间和计算资源，但AI工具在数据稀疏区域不可靠，需要与传统技术结合使用，可能阻碍颠覆性理论进步。

Conclusion: AI/ML有望加速持续性创新，但需要继续支持传统的实证、计算和理论研究，以维持制造和材料科学的重大突破可能性。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) raises expectations of substantial increases in rates of technological and scientific progress, but such anticipations are often not connected to detailed ground-level studies of AI use in innovation processes. Accordingly, it remains unclear how and to what extent AI can accelerate innovation. To help to fill this gap, we report results from 32 interviews with U.S.-based academic manufacturing and materials sciences researchers experienced with AI and machine learning (ML) techniques. Interviewees primarily used AI for modeling of materials and manufacturing processes, facilitating cheaper and more rapid search of design spaces for materials and manufacturing processes alike. They report benefits including cost, time, and computation savings in technology development. However, interviewees also report that AI/ML tools are unreliable outside design spaces for which dense data are already available; that they require skilled and judicious application in tandem with older research techniques; and that AI/ML tools may detrimentally circumvent opportunities for disruptive theoretical advancement. Based on these results, we suggest there is reason for optimism about acceleration in sustaining innovations through the use of to AI/ML; but that support for conventional empirical, computational, and theoretical research is required to maintain the likelihood of further major advances in manufacturing and materials science.

*Wendy Wong,Yuchao Jiang,Yuekang Li*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: DiverseClaire是一个使用LLM模拟神经多样性学生的试点研究，通过比较UDL转换的幻灯片与传统格式，发现神经多样性学生在传统格式下学习困难，需要多种格式的课程材料。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CS1等入门课程采用一刀切的教学形式会加剧认知负荷，不利于自闭症、ADHD、阅读障碍等神经多样性学生的学习，需要采用更具同理心的教学方法和通用学习设计。

Method: 使用LLM模拟包括神经多样性学生在内的多样化角色，利用布鲁姆分类法和UDL框架，比较UDL转换的幻灯片与传统格式的教学效果。

Result: 模拟的神经多样性学生在传统格式的幻灯片下学习困难，表明需要提供多种格式的课程材料来满足不同学习偏好。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了为不同学习者提供多种格式课程材料的必要性，试点研究数据将帮助未来的CS1教师改进教学。

Abstract: Although CS programs are booming, introductory courses like CS1 still adopt a one-size-fits-all formats that can exacerbate cognitive load and discourage learners with autism, ADHD, dyslexia and other neurological conditions. These call for compassionate pedagogies and Universal Design For Learning (UDL) to create learning environments and materials where cognitive diversity is welcomed. To address this, we introduce DiverseClaire a pilot study, which simulates students including neurodiverse profiles using LLMs and diverse personas. By leveraging Bloom's Taxonomy and UDL, DiverseClaire compared UDL-transformed lecture slides with traditional formats. To evaluate DiverseClaire controlled experiments, we used the evaluation metric the average score. The findings revealed that the simulated neurodiverse students struggled with learning due to lecture slides that were in inaccessible formats. These results highlight the need to provide course materials in multiple formats for diverse learner preferences. Data from our pilot study will be made available to assist future CS1 instructors.

### [78] [CAPIRE: Modelling the Impact of Teacher Strikes and Inflation on Student Trajectories in Engineering Education](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14573)
*H. R Paz*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 本研究扩展CAPIRE框架，加入宏观冲击模块分析教师罢工和通货膨胀对工程教育学生轨迹的影响。研究发现宏观特征能稳定提升早期辍学预测能力，罢工影响在2-3学期后最强，通货膨胀与罢工共同作用会产生非线性放大效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在宏观经济不稳定背景下，理解教师罢工和通货膨胀等宏观冲击如何通过制度结构影响学生教育轨迹，为多层级辍学理论提供实证基础。

Method: 使用阿根廷公立工程学院15个队列1343名学生的数据，构建包含国家通胀指标、滞后罢工暴露和课程摩擦交互项的多层级特征集，采用随机森林模型和基于队列的验证，并嵌入基于代理的模型进行情景模拟。

Result: 宏观特征将早期辍学预测的Macro F1从0.73提升至0.78；罢工暴露在中断后2-3学期对辍学影响最强(OR=2.34)；通货膨胀和罢工共同冲击产生的辍学水平比单独效应之和高18-23%。

Conclusion: 教师罢工和通货膨胀是通过课程设计和财务韧性等制度结构中介的教育干扰因素，而非孤立事件。该框架展示了宏观冲击如何通过制度结构传播影响个体轨迹，为宏观经济不稳定背景下的情景规划提供实证工具。

Abstract: This study extends the CAPIRE framework with a macro-shock module to analyse the impact of teacher strikes and inflation on student trajectories in engineering education. Using data from 1,343 students across 15 cohorts (2004-2019) in a public engineering faculty in Argentina, we construct a leak-aware, multilevel feature set that incorporates national inflation indicators, lagged exposure to teacher strikes, and interaction terms between macro shocks and curriculum friction. Random Forest models with cohort-based validation demonstrate that macro features provide stable, non-trivial gains in early-semester dropout prediction (improvement in Macro F1 from 0.73 to 0.78), with inflation volatility at entry and a strike-weighted basic-cycle friction index amongst the most influential variables. Lag analysis reveals that strike exposure exerts its strongest association with dropout two to three semesters after the disruption (OR = 2.34), and that effects are concentrated in early, high-friction semesters. We then embed these empirical patterns into an agent-based model, defining scenarios for inflation-only, strikes-only, and combined crisis. Simulations reproduce three stylised facts: delayed strike effects, basic-cycle vulnerability, and non-linear amplification when inflation and strikes co-occur, with combined shocks generating dropout levels 18-23% higher than the sum of individual effects. We argue that teacher strikes and inflation operate as structurally mediated educational disruptors, acting through curriculum design and financial resilience rather than as isolated events. The framework contributes to multilevel dropout theory by demonstrating how macro-level shocks propagate through institutional structures to shape individual trajectories and provides empirically grounded tools for scenario planning in macroeconomically unstable contexts.

### [79] [When AI Democratizes Exploitation: LLM-Assisted Strategic Manipulation of Fair Division Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14722)
*Priyanka Verma,Balagopal Unnikrishnan*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: LLMs可以打破公平资源分配算法的保护屏障，让普通用户通过简单对话查询获得可操作的操纵策略，在租金分配等场景中实现协调偏好操纵。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统公平资源分配算法（如Spliddit平台）因复杂性被认为难以被终端用户操纵，但LLMs可以民主化获取战略专业知识，打破这种保护屏障。

Method: 通过实证分析Spliddit租金分配算法，研究用户如何通过AI助手对话查询获得操纵策略，包括四种操纵场景：排他性共谋、防御性反策略、仁慈补贴和成本最小化联盟。

Result: 实验显示LLMs能够解释算法机制、识别有利偏差、生成协调偏好误报的具体数值输入，这些能力以前需要深厚技术知识。

Conclusion: AI驱动的操纵对系统完整性构成风险，但也为公平群体提供优先待遇机会。有效应对需要结合算法鲁棒性、参与式设计和AI能力的公平获取，承认战略复杂性不再是稀缺资源。

Abstract: Fair resource division algorithms, like those implemented in Spliddit platform, have traditionally been considered difficult for the end users to manipulate due to its complexities. This paper demonstrates how Large Language Models (LLMs) can dismantle these protective barriers by democratizing access to strategic expertise. Through empirical analysis of rent division scenarios on Spliddit algorithms, we show that users can obtain actionable manipulation strategies via simple conversational queries to AI assistants. We present four distinct manipulation scenarios: exclusionary collusion where majorities exploit minorities, defensive counterstrategies that backfire, benevolent subsidization of specific participants, and cost minimization coalitions. Our experiments reveal that LLMs can explain algorithmic mechanics, identify profitable deviations, and generate specific numerical inputs for coordinated preference misreporting--capabilities previously requiring deep technical knowledge. These findings extend algorithmic collective action theory from classification contexts to resource allocation scenarios, where coordinated preference manipulation replaces feature manipulation. The implications reach beyond rent division to any domain using algorithmic fairness mechanisms for resource division. While AI-enabled manipulation poses risks to system integrity, it also creates opportunities for preferential treatment of equity deserving groups. We argue that effective responses must combine algorithmic robustness, participatory design, and equitable access to AI capabilities, acknowledging that strategic sophistication is no longer a scarce resource.

*Michael Schuckers,Austin Hayes*

Main category: stat.AP

TL;DR: 使用103名P4大学橄榄球教练的数据构建统计模型，预测教练在新学校的成功。模型基于SP+评分，准确率为66%，但预测能力有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大学橄榄球教练招聘的成功因素，为学校提供数据驱动的招聘决策依据。

Method: 收集103名教练的50多个变量，使用29个变量构建交叉验证正则化线性回归模型，以SP+评分作为成功指标。

Result: 模型识别出重要因素：有大学主教练经验、曾赢得联盟冠军、曾任进攻协调员、年龄和学校历史表现，但预测趋势较弱，准确率66%。

Conclusion: 虽然某些因素对预测教练成功有影响，但组合因素无法高度预测成功，教练招聘仍存在较大不确定性。

Abstract: Using data on 103 recent P4 college football hires, we built a statistical model for predicting a coach's success at their new school. For each hire, we collected data about their background and experiences, the previous success as a head coach or coordinator and their success since hiring. Over 50 variables on these factors were recorded though we used 29 of these in building our predictive model. Our measure of success is based upon Bill Connelly's SP+ team ratings relative to the performance on the same metric of the school in the 15 year prior to their selection as head coach. Using a cross-validated regularized linear regression, we obtain a predictive model for coaching success. Among the important factors for predicting a successful hire are having been a previous college head coach, having won a prior conference championship as a head coach, leaving a job as an Offensive Coordinator, age and quality of the hiring school's team in the previous 15 years. While we do find these factors are important for the prediction of a successful coaching hire, the trends here are weak. With 66% accuracy, the model does identify coaching hires that will outperform team performance in the 15 years before the hire. However, no combination of these factors leads to high predictability of identifying a successful coaching hire. All of the data and code for this paper are available in a Github repository.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的足球事件数据混合模型，通过聚类整个进攻回合来揭示其时间、序列和空间结构，支持战术分析和虚拟训练环境开发。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注单个事件，缺乏对整个进攻回合的聚类分析。本研究旨在开发能够对完整进攻回合进行原则性聚类的模型，以支持战术分析和虚拟训练环境的发展。

Method: 采用混合模型，每个混合组件将进攻回合建模为标记时空点过程：事件类型遵循带有球权丢失吸收状态的有限马尔可夫链，事件时间遵循条件伽马过程以考虑分散性，空间位置通过截断布朗运动演化。使用广义期望最大化算法进行最大似然估计。

Result: 应用于2020/2021赛季法甲38场比赛的StatsBomb数据，该方法揭示了雷恩队面临的独特防守进攻模式。

Conclusion: 与之前关注单个事件的方法不同，该混合模型结构能够对完整进攻回合进行原则性聚类，为战术分析和未来开发逼真的虚拟训练环境提供了支持。

Abstract: We propose a novel mixture model for football event data that clusters entire possessions to reveal their temporal, sequential, and spatial structure. Each mixture component models possessions as marked spatio-temporal point processes: event types follow a finite Markov chain with an absorbing state for ball loss, event times follow a conditional Gamma process to account for dispersion, and spatial locations evolve via truncated Brownian motion. To aid interpretation, we derive summary indicators from model parameters capturing possession speed, number of events, and spatial dynamics. Parameters are estimated through maximum likelihood via Generalized Expectation-Maximization algorithm. Applied to StatsBomb data from 38 Ligue 1 matches (2020/2021), our approach uncovers distinct defensive possession patterns faced by Stade Rennais. Unlike previous approaches focusing on individual events, our mixture structure enables principled clustering of full possessions, supporting tactical analysis and the future development of realistic virtual training environments.

TL;DR: 提出非线性向量相干性(NVC)作为新的频谱依赖度量，用于捕捉脑区间的非线性相互作用，能够有效区分阿尔茨海默病和额颞叶痴呆的功能连接模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑电图(EEG)作为非侵入性技术，在阿尔茨海默病(AD)和额颞叶痴呆(FTD)的早期检测和鉴别诊断中具有潜力。传统通道到通道的方法存在局限性，需要更自然的脑区到脑区连接框架。

Method: 提出非线性向量相干性(NVC)度量，捕捉多变量时间序列间的非线性相互作用；引入基于秩的推断程序进行快速无分布估计；开发完全非参数频谱独立性检验。

Result: 数值实验验证了推断方法的性能；应用于静息态EEG数据，NVC揭示了具有诊断意义的连接模式，能有效区分健康个体与AD、FTD患者。

Conclusion: NVC为研究脑区间依赖关系提供了新方法，能够识别与AD和FTD相关的功能连接动态变化，在神经退行性疾病诊断中具有应用价值。

Abstract: Alterations in functional brain connectivity characterize neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). As a non-invasive and cost-effective technique, electroencephalography (EEG) is gaining increasing attention for its potential to identify reliable biomarkers for early detection and differential diagnosis of AD and FTD. Considering the behavioral similarities of signals from adjacent EEG channels, we propose a new spectral dependence measure, the nonlinear vector coherence (NVC), to capture beyond-linear interactions between oscillations of two multivariate time series observed from distinct brain regions. This addresses the limitations of conventional channel-to-channel approaches and defines a more natural region-to-region connectivity framework in the frequency domain. As a result, the NVC measure offers a new approach to investigate dependence between brain regions, which then enables to identify altered functional connectivity dynamics associated with AD and FTD. We further introduce a rank-based inference procedure that enables fast and distribution-free estimation of the proposed measure, as well as a fully nonparametric test for spectral independence. The empirical performance of our proposed inference methodology is demonstrated through extensive numerical experiments. An application to resting-state EEG data reveals that our novel NVC measure uncovers distinct and diagnostically meaningful connectivity patterns which effectively discriminate healthy individuals from those with AD and FTD.

Abstract: In this paper we examine the effectiveness of five mathematical models used to predict the outcomes of amateur darts games. These models not only predict the outcomes at the start of the game, but also update their estimations as the game score changes. The models were trained and tested on a dataset consisting of games played by amateur players involving students, faculty, and staff at Roanoke College. The five models are: the null model, which is based only on the live scores, a logistic regression model, a basic simulation model, a time-adjusted simulation model, and a new variation of the Massey model which updates based on the current score. We evaluate these models using two approaches. First, we compare their Brier scores. Second, we conduct head-to-head comparisons in a betting game in which one model sets the betting odds while the other places bets. In both cases, model performance is assessed not only at the start of the game but also at the start of each round. Across both evaluation methods, the score-dependent Massey model performs the best. We conclude by illustrating how this score-dependent Massey model framework can be adapted to other competitive settings beyond darts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 灾害引发的停电会对城市生命线系统产生级联影响，但电网故障与基本服务获取之间的时间耦合关系尚未得到充分量化。

Method: 整合约17.3万条15分钟停电记录和超过125万次3187个食品设施的访问数据，构建停电特征和食品获取指标的每日指数，通过滞后相关性分析和DTW k-means聚类识别恢复模式。

Result: 发现一致的2天滞后：食品获取在7月8日登陆时达到最低点，而停电严重程度在7月10日左右达到峰值；识别出4种复合类型学；道路网络稀疏性比收入更能决定获取损失的深度和持续性。

Conclusion: 该框架可将动态耦合模式转化为针对性的干预措施，用于阶段敏感性恢复和公平性准备，并可推广到其他生命线系统和灾害类型。

Abstract: Disaster-induced power outages create cascading disruptions across urban lifelines, yet the timed coupling between grid failure and essential service access remains poorly quantified. Focusing on Hurricane Beryl in Houston (2024), this study integrates approximately 173000 15-minute outage records with over 1.25 million visits to 3187 food facilities to quantify how infrastructure performance and human access co-evolve. We construct daily indices for outage characteristics (intensity, duration) and food access metrics (redundancy, frequency, proximity), estimate cross-system lags through lagged correlations over zero to seven days, and identify recovery patterns using DTW k-means clustering. Overlaying these clusters yields compound power-access typologies and enables facility-level criticality screening. The analysis reveals a consistent two-day lag: food access reaches its nadir on July 8 at landfall while outage severity peaks around July 10, with negative correlations strongest at a two-day lag and losing significance by day four. We identify four compound typologies from high/low outage crossed with high/low access disruption levels. Road network sparsity, more than income, determines the depth and persistence of access loss. Through this analysis, we enumerate 294 critical food facilities in the study area requiring targeted continuity measures including backup power, microgrids, and feeder prioritization. The novelty lies in measuring interdependency at daily operational resolution while bridging scales from communities to individual facilities, converting dynamic coupling patterns into actionable interventions for phase-sensitive restoration and equity-aware preparedness. The framework is transferable to other lifelines and hazards, offering a generalizable template for diagnosing and mitigating cascading effects on community access during disaster recovery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BOP2框架虽然灵活，但其使用的等比例随机化和等间隔中期分析可能不是最优的，需要改进其操作特性。

Method: 结合贝叶斯响应自适应随机化(BRAR)和最优中期分析位置，通过模拟研究评估改进效果。

Result: 改进后的设计能够提高最佳治疗分配效率，减少期望样本量，同时对统计功效影响很小。

Conclusion: 通过实施这些适应性改进，可以为实践者提供实用的试验设计建议，并提供了可复现的模拟代码。

Abstract: The Bayesian Optimal Phase II (BOP2) framework is a flexible trial design that can naturally facilitate complex adaptations due to its Bayesian setting. BOP2 uses equal randomisation and equally placed interim analyses in its design, but it is unclear whether these give the best operating characteristics. By incorporating Bayesian Response-Adaptive Randomisation (BRAR) and optimal interim analysis placement, we show that allocation to the best treatment and expected sample size can be improved with minimal impact on power. We discuss recommendations on implementing these adaptations, using simulation-based evidence, to give practical advice to practitioners. Reproducible code for the simulations is freely provided.

Motivation: 研究经典剪刀石头布游戏的多玩家扩展版本，探索其在多人情况下的可玩性和平衡性特征。

Method: 重新引入可玩性和平衡性的定义，基于一个猜想证明多人RPS游戏在m<50玩家时的强可玩性，并分析玩家数量趋于无穷时的极限行为。

Result: 证明了在玩家数量m<50时，该多人RPS游戏是强可玩的，并且在玩家数量趋于无穷时能够最大化游戏的不平衡性。

Conclusion: 多人剪刀石头布游戏在有限玩家数量下具有强可玩性，在极限情况下能够达到最大的不平衡性，这为理解多人对称游戏的性质提供了理论依据。

Abstract: Classic Rock-Paper-Scissors, RPS, has seen many variants and generalizations in the past several years. In the previous paper, we defined playability and balance for games. We used these definitions to show that different forms of imbalance agree on the most balanced and least balanced form of playable two-player n-object RPS games, referred to as (2,n)-RPS. We reintroduce these definitions here and show that, given a conjecture, the generalization of this game for m<50 players is a strongly playable RPS game. We also show that this game maximizes these forms of imbalance in the limit as the number of players goes to infinity.

Motivation: 作者认为现有的经济理论虽然不断改进，但需要整合物理学见解，特别是能量守恒定律，以实现理论的公理化完备性。

Method: 通过理论分析，论证比较优势理论依赖于能量守恒定律，并探讨经济现象中零和参数的必要性。

Conclusion: 将物理学原理（如能量守恒）融入经济理论可以增强其完备性，经济现象的存在依赖于特定的守恒定律和零和参数。

Abstract: Many economic theories have been introduced over the course of history to articulate our understanding of the economy. Classical theories by Adam Smith and David Ricardo's Comparative Advantage have been foundational for the last century's work. Improvements have been achieved over time, incorporating insights from many disparate fields of study: contemporary frameworks like Behavioural Economics and Information Economics, which incorporate psychological insights and deviation from rational decision-making and insights from network theory and how the information flow affects the market behaviour, respectively. In this paper, I motivate the necessity of incorporating insights from Physics, and also show that trade as a phenomenon described by the comparative advantage theory cannot exist without the law of conservation of Energy, and incorporating this law leads to axiomatic completeness of the theory. Further, I also argue that while the economy is not a zero-sum game in terms of wealth, it does require at least one associated zero-sum parameter for trade and economy as phenomena to exist.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究决策者在面对不确定性时，如何从数据经纪人处购买额外信息，以及数据经纪人如何设计最优销售机制来最大化收益。

Method: 通过信号筛选机制，允许数据经纪人销售与决策者私有信号任意相关的所有可能信号，在二元行动设置中为每种类型提供不同的二进制信号。

Result: 在二元行动设置中，数据经纪人能够提取有效剩余，即使不知道先验分布。在更一般环境中，提供了实现有效剩余提取的条件。

Conclusion: 数据经纪人可以通过精心设计的信号销售机制提取有效剩余，但在某些情况下可能无法实现完全的有效剩余提取。

Abstract: I consider an environment in which a decision maker faces uncertainty and privately holds information in the form of a signal about the true state of the world. The decision maker purchases additional information from a data broker before receiving the signal realization. I characterize the data broker's optimal selling mechanism, which involves screening over all possible signals. I allow the space of all signals the data broker can sell to be arbitrarily correlated with the signal the decision maker owns. This plays a key role in designing the optimal menu. In the binary action setting, the data broker extracts the efficient surplus by offering a distinct binary signal for each type. Moreover, this result holds even when the broker does not know the prior distribution over states. In more general environments, I provide conditions on the payoff structure and the decision maker's type space under which the data broker extracts the efficient surplus. I discuss scenarios in which efficient surplus extraction is not possible.

*Henry Daniel Vera Ramirez*

Main category: econ.TH

TL;DR: 量子现实主义的主要矛盾在于观察者独立现实与主体认知解释过程介导现实之间的张力，这一矛盾在社会科学中尤为突出，挑战了经典客观性概念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨量子现实主义中的观察者角色矛盾如何与社会科学的现实建构问题相呼应，揭示物理学矛盾在社会科学中的延伸意义。

Method: 通过分析量子力学中观察者作用（如波函数坍缩）与社会现实中人类解释行动塑造社会现实的相似性，进行跨学科比较。

Result: 发现量子现实主义的矛盾不仅存在于物理学领域，还深刻关联到社会现实建构的困难与动态过程。

Conclusion: 量子现实主义的内在矛盾丰富了认识论和本体论辩论，表明这些矛盾超越了物理学范畴，与社会现实建构的复杂性紧密相连。

Abstract: The text points out that one of the main contradictions of quantum realism, which is particularly relevant to the social sciences, is the tension between the existence of an observer-independent reality and the idea that this reality is mediated by the cognitive and interpretative processes of the subject. This contradiction arises from the central role of the observer in phenomena such as the collapse of the wave function and their influence on the construction of reality, which challenges the classical notion of an objective, non-perceptual nature. Moreover, the encounter between social realism and social interpretivism lies in the fact that, in the social sciences, it is also recognized that human interpretations and actions shape social reality, creating a scenario in which absolute objectivity becomes difficult to sustain. These tensions, therefore enrich the epistemological and ontological debate, showing that the contradictions of quantum realism transcend physics and connect deeply with the difficulties and dynamics of the social construction of reality.

*Jiarui Li,Alessandro Zanardi,Runyu Zhang,Gioele Zardini*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一个系统级的多智能体路径规划框架，将规划与执行集成，统一处理各种变体问题，并显式建模不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MAPF方法将规划与执行分离，以临时方式处理问题变体，缺乏系统级框架来整合规划执行并处理不确定性。

Method: 引入MAPF系统作为核心形式模型，将MAPF视为控制设计问题；提出FICO算法，基于因子分解和滚动时域控制思想，利用组合结构实现高效闭环操作。

Result: FICO实现毫秒级实时响应，可扩展到数千个智能体，适应执行时不确定性；相比开环基线，计算时间减少两个数量级，在随机延迟和智能体到达情况下吞吐量显著提高。

Conclusion: 通过系统级建模、因子分解和闭环设计，为MAPF的分析和发展建立了理论基础。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Path Finding is a fundamental problem in robotics and AI, yet most existing formulations treat planning and execution separately and address variants of the problem in an ad hoc manner. This paper presents a system-level framework for MAPF that integrates planning and execution, generalizes across variants, and explicitly models uncertainties. At its core is the MAPF system, a formal model that casts MAPF as a control design problem encompassing classical and uncertainty-aware formulations. To solve it, we introduce Finite-Horizon Closed-Loop Factorization (FICO), a factorization-based algorithm inspired by receding-horizon control that exploits compositional structure for efficient closed-loop operation. FICO enables real-time responses -- commencing execution within milliseconds -- while scaling to thousands of agents and adapting seamlessly to execution-time uncertainties. Extensive case studies demonstrate that it reduces computation time by up to two orders of magnitude compared with open-loop baselines, while delivering significantly higher throughput under stochastic delays and agent arrivals. These results establish a principled foundation for analyzing and advancing MAPF through system-level modeling, factorization, and closed-loop design.

Motivation: 自主机器人系统需要鲁棒的实时感知能力，激光雷达和IMU传感器具有互补优势，但现有方法在连续性和计算效率方面存在不足。

Method: 使用连续时间B样条轨迹联合配准多分辨率面元图与GMM，采用非均匀时间节点放置确保轨迹连续性，通过克罗内克和与积加速协方差和GMM计算，结合无迹变换和分段运动补偿。

Conclusion: LIO-MARS系统通过创新的连续时间轨迹表示和高效计算方法，实现了鲁棒且准确的激光雷达-惯性里程计，适用于多种机器人平台。

Abstract: Autonomous robotic systems heavily rely on environment knowledge to safely navigate. For search & rescue, a flying robot requires robust real-time perception, enabled by complementary sensors. IMU data constrains acceleration and rotation, whereas LiDAR measures accurate distances around the robot. Building upon the LiDAR odometry MARS, our LiDAR-inertial odometry (LIO) jointly aligns multi-resolution surfel maps with a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) using a continuous-time B-spline trajectory. Our new scan window uses non-uniform temporal knot placement to ensure continuity over the whole trajectory without additional scan delay. Moreover, we accelerate essential covariance and GMM computations with Kronecker sums and products by a factor of 3.3. An unscented transform de-skews surfels, while a splitting into intra-scan segments facilitates motion compensation during spline optimization. Complementary soft constraints on relative poses and preintegrated IMU pseudo-measurements further improve robustness and accuracy. Extensive evaluation showcases the state-of-the-art quality of our LIO-MARS w.r.t. recent LIO systems on various handheld, ground and aerial vehicle-based datasets.

TL;DR: STAR是一个统一时空检索的框架，将记忆查询和具身动作集成在单一决策循环中，用于动态开放世界中的物体检索任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法只能解决部分问题：场景图捕捉空间关系但忽略时间基础，时序推理方法建模动态但不支持具身交互，动态场景图处理两者但仍是封闭世界。需要统一的方法来处理时空检索问题。

Method: STAR框架利用非参数长期记忆和工作记忆支持高效回忆，使用视觉语言模型在每一步选择时序或空间动作，将记忆查询和具身动作统一在单一决策循环中。

Result: 在STARBench基准测试和Tiago机器人实验中，STAR始终优于场景图和仅记忆的基线方法，证明了将时间搜索和空间搜索作为统一问题处理的好处。

Conclusion: STAR框架成功地将时空检索统一起来，证明了在动态开放世界环境中处理物体检索任务时，集成时间搜索和空间搜索的有效性。

Abstract: Service robots must retrieve objects in dynamic, open-world settings where requests may reference attributes ("the red mug"), spatial context ("the mug on the table"), or past states ("the mug that was here yesterday"). Existing approaches capture only parts of this problem: scene graphs capture spatial relations but ignore temporal grounding, temporal reasoning methods model dynamics but do not support embodied interaction, and dynamic scene graphs handle both but remain closed-world with fixed vocabularies. We present STAR (SpatioTemporal Active Retrieval), a framework that unifies memory queries and embodied actions within a single decision loop. STAR leverages non-parametric long-term memory and a working memory to support efficient recall, and uses a vision-language model to select either temporal or spatial actions at each step. We introduce STARBench, a benchmark of spatiotemporal object search tasks across simulated and real environments. Experiments in STARBench and on a Tiago robot show that STAR consistently outperforms scene-graph and memory-only baselines, demonstrating the benefits of treating search in time and search in space as a unified problem.

Motivation: 多机器人系统在救援、配送等关键应用中需要在拥挤受限空间中高速导航，且角色优先级会动态变化，需要既安全又敏捷的解决方案

Method: 采用自然语言通信协调任务，结合新型人工势场算法在冲突时自动形成"环岛"效应来平衡安全性和敏捷性

Result: FACA比基线方法效率提升3.5倍以上，任务完成时间减少70%以上，同时保持鲁棒的安全边界

Conclusion: FACA方法通过语言协调和智能势场设计，在多机器人拥挤环境中实现了安全与效率的平衡

Abstract: Multi-robot systems are increasingly being used for critical applications such as rescuing injured people, delivering food and medicines, and monitoring key areas. These applications usually involve navigating at high speeds through constrained spaces such as small gaps. Navigating such constrained spaces becomes particularly challenging when the space is crowded with multiple heterogeneous agents all of which have urgent priorities. What makes the problem even harder is that during an active response situation, roles and priorities can quickly change on a dime without informing the other agents. In order to complete missions in such environments, robots must not only be safe, but also agile, able to dodge and change course at a moment's notice. In this paper, we propose FACA, a fair and agile collision avoidance approach where robots coordinate their tasks by talking to each other via natural language (just as people do). In FACA, robots balance safety with agility via a novel artificial potential field algorithm that creates an automatic ``roundabout'' effect whenever a conflict arises. Our experiments show that FACA achieves a improvement in efficiency, completing missions more than 3.5X faster than baselines with a time reduction of over 70% while maintaining robust safety margins.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统导航方法依赖静态BIM先验或有限的机载感知能力，无法有效应对动态建筑环境中的不确定性。

Method: 融合空中和地面机器人的实时LiDAR数据与BIM先验，维护动态演化的2D占据地图，通过统一走廊风险指标量化导航安全性，当风险超过阈值时自动触发无人机重新扫描。

Result: 在PX4-Gazebo仿真中验证，风险触发重新扫描使平均走廊风险降低58%，地图熵降低43%，同时保持0.4米以上的安全距离，相比前沿探索方法在相同不确定性减少下节省一半任务时间。

Conclusion: 将BIM先验与风险自适应空中感知相结合，能够为建筑机器人实现可扩展的、不确定性感知的自主性。

Abstract: This paper presents a BIM-discrepancy-driven active sensing framework for cooperative navigation between unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) in dynamic construction environments. Traditional navigation approaches rely on static Building Information Modeling (BIM) priors or limited onboard perception. In contrast, our framework continuously fuses real-time LiDAR data from aerial and ground robots with BIM priors to maintain an evolving 2D occupancy map. We quantify navigation safety through a unified corridor-risk metric integrating occupancy uncertainty, BIM-map discrepancy, and clearance. When risk exceeds safety thresholds, the UAV autonomously re-scans affected regions to reduce uncertainty and enable safe replanning. Validation in PX4-Gazebo simulation with Robotec GPU LiDAR demonstrates that risk-triggered re-scanning reduces mean corridor risk by 58% and map entropy by 43% compared to static BIM navigation, while maintaining clearance margins above 0.4 m. Compared to frontier-based exploration, our approach achieves similar uncertainty reduction in half the mission time. These results demonstrate that integrating BIM priors with risk-adaptive aerial sensing enables scalable, uncertainty-aware autonomy for construction robotics.

Abstract: Conventional suction cups lack sensing capabilities for contact-aware manipulation in unstructured environments. This paper presents FlexiCup, a fully wireless multimodal suction cup that integrates dual-zone vision-tactile sensing. The central zone dynamically switches between vision and tactile modalities via illumination control for contact detection, while the peripheral zone provides continuous spatial awareness for approach planning. FlexiCup supports both vacuum and Bernoulli suction modes through modular mechanical configurations, achieving complete wireless autonomy with onboard computation and power. We validate hardware versatility through dual control paradigms. Modular perception-driven grasping across structured surfaces with varying obstacle densities demonstrates comparable performance between vacuum (90.0% mean success) and Bernoulli (86.7% mean success) modes. Diffusion-based end-to-end learning achieves 73.3% success on inclined transport and 66.7% on orange extraction tasks. Ablation studies confirm that multi-head attention coordinating dual-zone observations provides 13% improvements for contact-aware manipulation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统VLA模型使用同步流匹配，依赖刚性时间调度，缺乏动作上下文感知和异步自校正能力，在长时程任务中容易因单个动作错误导致级联失败。

Method: 引入异步流匹配，在非均匀时间调度下生成动作token，结合置信度评估器选择性精炼不准确的动作token，并提出了SFM和AFM的统一训练流程。

Conclusion: AsyncVLA通过异步生成和自校正机制显著提升了VLA模型在长时程任务中的稳定性和性能。

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for building generalist robots. However, traditional VLA models that generate actions through flow matching (FM) typically rely on rigid and uniform time schedules, i.e., synchronous FM (SFM). Without action context awareness and asynchronous self-correction, SFM becomes unstable in long-horizon tasks, where a single action error can cascade into failure. In this work, we propose asynchronous flow matching VLA (AsyncVLA), a novel framework that introduces temporal flexibility in asynchronous FM (AFM) and enables self-correction in action generation. AsyncVLA breaks from the vanilla SFM in VLA models by generating the action tokens in a non-uniform time schedule with action context awareness. Besides, our method introduces the confidence rater to extract confidence of the initially generated actions, enabling the model to selectively refine inaccurate action tokens before execution. Moreover, we propose a unified training procedure for SFM and AFM that endows a single model with both modes, improving KV-cache utilization. Extensive experiments on robotic manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that AsyncVLA is data-efficient and exhibits self-correction ability. AsyncVLA achieves state-of-the-art results across general embodied evaluations due to its asynchronous generation in AFM. Our code is available at https://github.com/YuhuaJiang2002/AsyncVLA.

Abstract: Household tidying is an important application area, yet current benchmarks neither model user preferences nor support mobility, and they generalize poorly, making it hard to comprehensively assess integrated language-to-action capabilities. To address this, we propose RoboTidy, a unified benchmark for language-guided household tidying that supports Vision-Language-Action (VLA) and Vision-Language-Navigation (VLN) training and evaluation. RoboTidy provides 500 photorealistic 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) household scenes (covering 500 objects and containers) with collisions, formulates tidying as an "Action (Object, Container)" list, and supplies 6.4k high-quality manipulation demonstration trajectories and 1.5k naviagtion trajectories to support both few-shot and large-scale training. We also deploy RoboTidy in the real world for object tidying, establishing an end-to-end benchmark for household tidying. RoboTidy offers a scalable platform and bridges a key gap in embodied AI by enabling holistic and realistic evaluation of language-guided robots.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated significant potential in real-world robotic manipulation. However, pre-trained VLA policies still suffer from substantial performance degradation during downstream deployment. Although fine-tuning can mitigate this issue, its reliance on costly demonstration collection and intensive computation makes it impractical in real-world settings. In this work, we introduce VLA-Pilot, a plug-and-play inference-time policy steering method for zero-shot deployment of pre-trained VLA without any additional fine-tuning or data collection. We evaluate VLA-Pilot on six real-world downstream manipulation tasks across two distinct robotic embodiments, encompassing both in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that VLA-Pilot substantially boosts the success rates of off-the-shelf pre-trained VLA policies, enabling robust zero-shot generalization to diverse tasks and embodiments.

Abstract: Understanding the physical interaction with wearable robots is essential to ensure safety and comfort. However, this interaction is complex in two key aspects: (1) the motion involved, and (2) the non-linear behaviour of soft tissues. Multiple approaches have been undertaken to better understand this interaction and to improve the quantitative metrics of physical interfaces or cuffs. As these two topics are closely interrelated, finite modelling and soft tissue characterisation offer valuable insights into pressure distribution and shear stress induced by the cuff. Nevertheless, current characterisation methods typically rely on a single fitting variable along one degree of freedom, which limits their applicability, given that interactions with wearable robots often involve multiple degrees of freedom. To address this limitation, this work introduces a dual-variable characterisation method, involving normal and tangential forces, aimed at identifying reliable material parameters and evaluating the impact of single-variable fitting on force and torque responses. This method demonstrates the importance of incorporating two variables into the characterisation process by analysing the normalized mean square error (NMSE) across different scenarios and material models, providing a foundation for simulation at the closest possible level, with a focus on the cuff and the human limb involved in the physical interaction between the user and the wearable robot.

Abstract: Active Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (Active SLAM) involves the strategic planning and precise control of a robotic system's movement in order to construct a highly accurate and comprehensive representation of its surrounding environment, which has garnered significant attention within the research community. While the current methods demonstrate efficacy in small and controlled settings, they face challenges when applied to large-scale and diverse environments, marked by extended periods of exploration and suboptimal paths of discovery. In this paper, we propose MA-SLAM, a Map-Aware Active SLAM system based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), designed to address the challenge of efficient exploration in large-scale environments. In pursuit of this objective, we put forward a novel structured map representation. By discretizing the spatial data and integrating the boundary points and the historical trajectory, the structured map succinctly and effectively encapsulates the visited regions, thereby serving as input for the deep reinforcement learning based decision module. Instead of sequentially predicting the next action step within the decision module, we have implemented an advanced global planner to optimize the exploration path by leveraging long-range target points. We conducted experiments in three simulation environments and deployed in a real unmanned ground vehicle (UGV), the results demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces both the duration and distance of exploration compared with state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Monocular simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithms estimate drone poses and build a 3D map using a single camera. Current algorithms include sparse methods that lack detailed geometry, while learning-driven approaches produce dense maps but are computationally intensive. Monocular SLAM also faces scale ambiguities, which affect its accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose an edge-aware lightweight monocular SLAM system combining sparse keypoint-based pose estimation with dense edge reconstruction. Our method employs deep learning-based depth prediction and edge detection, followed by optimization to refine keypoints and edges for geometric consistency, without relying on global loop closure or heavy neural computations. We fuse inertial data with vision by using an extended Kalman filter to resolve scale ambiguity and improve accuracy. The system operates in real time on low-power platforms, as demonstrated on a DJI Tello drone with a monocular camera and inertial sensors. In addition, we demonstrate robust autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance in indoor corridors and on the TUM RGBD dataset. Our approach offers an effective, practical solution to real-time mapping and navigation in resource-constrained environments.

We propose a unifying set of concepts by which to consider and develop place recognition mechanisms and identify key challenges such as generalization, robustness, and environmental variability. This review aims to foster innovations in artificial localization by connecting future developments in artificial place recognition systems to insights from both animal navigation research and human spatial cognition studies.

Result: 在模拟环境中验证了不同数量无人机的性能，证明能在消费级无人机硬件限制下安全探索环境并重建地图

Conclusion: 成功将多无人机自主探索技术扩展到消费级平台，为低成本自主探索应用提供了可行方案

Abstract: In our work, we extend the current state-of-the-art approach for autonomous multi-UAV exploration to consumer-level UAVs, such as the DJI Mini 3 Pro. We propose a pipeline that selects viewpoint pairs from which the depth can be estimated and plans the trajectory that satisfies motion constraints necessary for odometry estimation. For the multi-UAV exploration, we propose a semi-distributed communication scheme that distributes the workload in a balanced manner. We evaluate our model performance in simulation for different numbers of UAVs and prove its ability to safely explore the environment and reconstruct the map even with the hardware limitations of consumer-grade UAVs.

Abstract: Language-conditioned manipulation facilitates human-robot interaction via behavioral cloning (BC), which learns control policies from human demonstrations and serves as a cornerstone of embodied AI. Overcoming compounding errors in sequential action decisions remains a central challenge to improving BC performance. Existing approaches mitigate compounding errors through data augmentation, expressive representation, or temporal abstraction. However, they suffer from physical discontinuities and semantic-physical misalignment, leading to inaccurate action cloning and intermittent execution. In this paper, we present Continuous vision-language-action Co-Learning with Semantic-Physical Alignment (CCoL), a novel BC framework that ensures temporally consistent execution and fine-grained semantic grounding. It generates robust and smooth action execution trajectories through continuous co-learning across vision, language, and proprioceptive inputs (e.g., robot internal states). Meanwhile, we anchor language semantics to visuomotor representations by a bidirectional cross-attention to learn contextual information for action generation, successfully overcoming the problem of semantic-physical misalignment. Extensive experiments show that CCoL achieves an average 8.0% relative improvement across three simulation suites, with up to 19.2% relative gain in human-demonstrated bimanual insertion tasks. Real-world tests on a 7-DoF robot further confirm CCoL's generalization under unseen and noisy object states.

Abstract: Effective contact-rich manipulation requires robots to synergistically leverage vision, force, and proprioception. However, Reinforcement Learning agents struggle to learn in such multisensory settings, especially amidst sensory noise and dynamic changes. We propose MultiSensory Dynamic Pretraining (MSDP), a novel framework for learning expressive multisensory representations tailored for task-oriented policy learning. MSDP is based on masked autoencoding and trains a transformer-based encoder by reconstructing multisensory observations from only a subset of sensor embeddings, leading to cross-modal prediction and sensor fusion. For downstream policy learning, we introduce a novel asymmetric architecture, where a cross-attention mechanism allows the critic to extract dynamic, task-specific features from the frozen embeddings, while the actor receives a stable pooled representation to guide its actions. Our method demonstrates accelerated learning and robust performance under diverse perturbations, including sensor noise, and changes in object dynamics. Evaluations in multiple challenging, contact-rich robot manipulation tasks in simulation and the real world showcase the effectiveness of MSDP. Our approach exhibits strong robustness to perturbations and achieves high success rates on the real robot with as few as 6,000 online interactions, offering a simple yet powerful solution for complex multisensory robotic control.

Abstract: Industrial robotic systems (IRS) are increasingly deployed in diverse environments, where failures can result in severe accidents and costly downtime. Ensuring the reliability of the software controlling these systems is therefore critical. Mutation testing, a technique widely used in software engineering, evaluates the effectiveness of test suites by introducing small faults, or mutants, into the code. However, traditional mutation operators are poorly suited to robotic programs, which involve message-based commands and interactions with the physical world. This paper explores the adaptation of mutation testing to IRS by defining domain-specific mutation operators that capture the semantics of robot actions and sensor readings. We propose a methodology for generating meaningful mutants at the level of high-level read and write operations, including movement, gripper actions, and sensor noise injection. An empirical study on a pick-and-place scenario demonstrates that our approach produces more informative mutants and reduces the number of invalid or equivalent cases compared to conventional operators. Results highlight the potential of mutation testing to enhance test suite quality and contribute to safer, more reliable industrial robotic systems.

Abstract: We propose a method for combining Harmonic Control Lyapunov-Barrier Functions (HCLBFs) derived from Signal Temporal Logic (STL) specifications with any given robot policy to turn an unsafe policy into a safe one with formal guarantees.  The two components are combined via HCLBF-derived safety certificates, thus producing commands that preserve both safety and task-driven behavior.  We demonstrate with a simple proof-of-concept implementation for an object-centric force-based policy trained through reinforcement learning for a movement task of a stationary robot arm that is able to avoid colliding with obstacles on a table top after combining the policy with the safety constraints.  The proposed method can be generalized to more complex specifications and dynamic task settings.

Abstract: Flexible robots hold great promise for enhancing minimally invasive surgery (MIS) by providing superior dexterity, precise control, and safe tissue interaction. Yet, translating these advantages into endoscopic interventions within open cavities remains challenging. The lack of anatomical constraints and the inherent flexibility of such devices complicate their control, while the limited field of view of endoscopes restricts situational awareness. We present a robotic platform designed to overcome these challenges and demonstrate its potential in fetoscopic laser coagulation, a complex MIS procedure typically performed only by highly experienced surgeons. Our system combines a magnetically actuated flexible endoscope with teleoperated and semi-autonomous navigation capabilities for performing targeted laser ablations. To enhance surgical awareness, the platform reconstructs real-time mosaics of the endoscopic scene, providing an extended and continuous visual context. The ability of this system to address the key limitations of MIS in open spaces is validated in vivo in an ovine model.

Conclusion: 该系统能够有效解决工业火灾中火源定位不准确的问题，提高消防效率和准确性。

Abstract: Fires in industrial facilities pose special challenges to firefighters, e.g., due to the sheer size and scale of the buildings. The resulting visual obstructions impair firefighting accuracy, further compounded by inaccurate assessments of the fire's location. Such imprecision simultaneously increases the overall damage and prolongs the fire-brigades operation unnecessarily.
  We propose an automated assistance system for firefighting using a motorized fire monitor on a turntable ladder with aerial support from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The UAV flies autonomously within an obstacle-free flight funnel derived from geodata, detecting and localizing heat sources. An operator supervises the operation on a handheld controller and selects a fire target in reach. After the selection, the UAV automatically plans and traverses between two triangulation poses for continued fire localization. Simultaneously, our system steers the fire monitor to ensure the water jet reaches the detected heat source. In preliminary tests, our assistance system successfully localized multiple heat sources and directed a water jet towards the fires.

Motivation: 传统基于演示的奖励学习容易过度拟合虚假相关性，而语言指令可以更直接地指定任务重点，但现有方法未能充分利用语言解决模糊性的潜力。

Method: 使用LLM从语言指令推断状态相关性掩码，强制对不相关状态组件保持不变性；当指令模糊时，在演示上下文中使用LLM推理进行澄清。

Result: 在仿真和真实机器人上，Masked IRL比现有语言条件IRL方法性能提升达15%，同时数据使用量减少4.7倍，表现出更好的样本效率、泛化能力和对模糊语言的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 结合语言和演示的互补信息，通过状态掩码和LLM推理，可以有效解决奖励学习中的模糊性问题，提高学习效率和泛化能力。

Abstract: Robots can adapt to user preferences by learning reward functions from demonstrations, but with limited data, reward models often overfit to spurious correlations and fail to generalize. This happens because demonstrations show robots how to do a task but not what matters for that task, causing the model to focus on irrelevant state details. Natural language can more directly specify what the robot should focus on, and, in principle, disambiguate between many reward functions consistent with the demonstrations. However, existing language-conditioned reward learning methods typically treat instructions as simple conditioning signals, without fully exploiting their potential to resolve ambiguity. Moreover, real instructions are often ambiguous themselves, so naive conditioning is unreliable. Our key insight is that these two input types carry complementary information: demonstrations show how to act, while language specifies what is important. We propose Masked Inverse Reinforcement Learning (Masked IRL), a framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to combine the strengths of both input types. Masked IRL infers state-relevance masks from language instructions and enforces invariance to irrelevant state components. When instructions are ambiguous, it uses LLM reasoning to clarify them in the context of the demonstrations. In simulation and on a real robot, Masked IRL outperforms prior language-conditioned IRL methods by up to 15% while using up to 4.7 times less data, demonstrating improved sample-efficiency, generalization, and robustness to ambiguous language.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show great promise for autonomous driving, but their suitability for safety-critical scenarios is largely unexplored, raising safety concerns. This issue arises from the lack of comprehensive benchmarks that assess both external environmental risks and in-cabin driving behavior safety simultaneously. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce DSBench, the first comprehensive Driving Safety Benchmark designed to assess a VLM's awareness of various safety risks in a unified manner. DSBench encompasses two major categories: external environmental risks and in-cabin driving behavior safety, divided into 10 key categories and a total of 28 sub-categories. This comprehensive evaluation covers a wide range of scenarios, ensuring a thorough assessment of VLMs' performance in safety-critical contexts. Extensive evaluations across various mainstream open-source and closed-source VLMs reveal significant performance degradation under complex safety-critical situations, highlighting urgent safety concerns. To address this, we constructed a large dataset of 98K instances focused on in-cabin and external safety scenarios, showing that fine-tuning on this dataset significantly enhances the safety performance of existing VLMs and paves the way for advancing autonomous driving technology. The benchmark toolkit, code, and model checkpoints will be publicly accessible.

Conclusion: 基于体素网格的LiDAR感知框架Gallant通过端到端优化显著提升了人形机器人在3D约束地形中的运动能力，超越了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Robust humanoid locomotion requires accurate and globally consistent perception of the surrounding 3D environment. However, existing perception modules, mainly based on depth images or elevation maps, offer only partial and locally flattened views of the environment, failing to capture the full 3D structure. This paper presents Gallant, a voxel-grid-based framework for humanoid locomotion and local navigation in 3D constrained terrains. It leverages voxelized LiDAR data as a lightweight and structured perceptual representation, and employs a z-grouped 2D CNN to map this representation to the control policy, enabling fully end-to-end optimization. A high-fidelity LiDAR simulation that dynamically generates realistic observations is developed to support scalable, LiDAR-based training and ensure sim-to-real consistency. Experimental results show that Gallant's broader perceptual coverage facilitates the use of a single policy that goes beyond the limitations of previous methods confined to ground-level obstacles, extending to lateral clutter, overhead constraints, multi-level structures, and narrow passages. Gallant also firstly achieves near 100% success rates in challenging scenarios such as stair climbing and stepping onto elevated platforms through improved end-to-end optimization.

Abstract: Vision--language--action (VLA) models have recently shown promising performance on a variety of embodied tasks, yet they still fall short in reliability and generalization, especially when deployed across different embodiments or real-world environments. In this work, we introduce NORA-1.5, a VLA model built from the pre-trained NORA backbone by adding to it a flow-matching-based action expert. This architectural enhancement alone yields substantial performance gains, enabling NORA-1.5 to outperform NORA and several state-of-the-art VLA models across both simulated and real-world benchmarks. To further improve robustness and task success, we develop a set of reward models for post-training VLA policies. Our rewards combine (i) an action-conditioned world model (WM) that evaluates whether generated actions lead toward the desired goal, and (ii) a deviation-from-ground-truth heuristic that distinguishes good actions from poor ones. Using these reward signals, we construct preference datasets and adapt NORA-1.5 to target embodiments through direct preference optimization (DPO). Extensive evaluations show that reward-driven post-training consistently improves performance in both simulation and real-robot settings, demonstrating significant VLA model-reliability gains through simple yet effective reward models. Our findings highlight NORA-1.5 and reward-guided post-training as a viable path toward more dependable embodied agents suitable for real-world deployment.

Result: 在飞机滑行和基于神经网络的漫游车导航案例研究中验证了框架的有效性。

Conclusion: RoVer-CoRe是首个基于HJ可达性分析的感知系统验证框架，能够处理感知不确定性下的安全验证问题。

Abstract: As perception-based controllers for autonomous systems become increasingly popular in the real world, it is important that we can formally verify their safety and performance despite perceptual uncertainty. Unfortunately, the verification of such systems remains challenging, largely due to the complexity of the controllers, which are often nonlinear, nonconvex, learning-based, and/or black-box. Prior works propose verification algorithms that are based on approximate reachability methods, but they often restrict the class of controllers and systems that can be handled or result in overly conservative analyses. Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis is a popular formal verification tool for general nonlinear systems that can compute optimal reachable sets under worst-case system uncertainties; however, its application to perception-based systems is currently underexplored. In this work, we propose RoVer-CoRe, a framework for the Robust Verification of Controllers via HJ Reachability. To the best of our knowledge, RoVer-CoRe is the first HJ reachability-based framework for the verification of perception-based systems under perceptual uncertainty. Our key insight is to concatenate the system controller, observation function, and the state estimation modules to obtain an equivalent closed-loop system that is readily compatible with existing reachability frameworks. Within RoVer-CoRe, we propose novel methods for formal safety verification and robust controller design. We demonstrate the efficacy of the framework in case studies involving aircraft taxiing and NN-based rover navigation. Code is available at the link in the footnote.

Abstract: Learning from real-world robot demonstrations holds promise for interacting with complex real-world environments. However, the complexity and variability of interaction dynamics often cause purely positional controllers to struggle with contacts or varying payloads. To address this, we propose a Heterogeneous Meta-Control (HMC) framework for Loco-Manipulation that adaptively stitches multiple control modalities: position, impedance, and hybrid force-position. We first introduce an interface, HMC-Controller, for blending actions from different control profiles continuously in the torque space. HMC-Controller facilitates both teleoperation and policy deployment. Then, to learn a robust force-aware policy, we propose HMC-Policy to unify different controllers into a heterogeneous architecture. We adopt a mixture-of-experts style routing to learn from large-scale position-only data and fine-grained force-aware demonstrations. Experiments on a real humanoid robot show over 50% relative improvement vs. baselines on challenging tasks such as compliant table wiping and drawer opening, demonstrating the efficacy of HMC.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统静态面板模型无法捕捉市场竞争对贫困的时变和滞后效应，需要更先进的函数型数据分析方法来揭示这种动态关系。

Method: 使用1991-2017年48个国家的年度数据，采用函数对函数回归方法，将贫困率与市场集中度等宏观经济指标联系起来，并进行基于市值的函数聚类分析。

Result: 竞争在结构调整阶段初期会增加贫困，但2010年后负面影响减弱；竞争对贫困的影响持续约5年；低中市值经济体竞争具有亲贫滞后效应，高市值经济体效应不显著或轻微负面。

Conclusion: 函数型数据方法能够揭示静态面板模型无法捕捉的演化和滞后依赖的贫困-竞争关系，强调了考虑时滞效应和经济异质性的重要性。

Abstract: This paper investigates how market competition influences poverty dynamics using a functional econometric framework that captures both contemporaneous and lagged effects. Using annual data for 48 countries from 1991-2017, we estimate function-on-function regressions linking poverty headcount ratios to market concentration and other macroeconomic indicators. The results show that, based on the entire sample, stronger competition initially increased poverty during structural adjustment phases, but its adverse impact weakened after 2010 as economies adapted and efficiency gains emerged. The estimated bivariate surfaces reveal that the effect of competition on poverty often persists over multiple years (around 5 years), highlighting the importance of intertemporal transmission. Then, functional clustering based on market capitalization (MCAP) uncovers strong heterogeneity: pro-poor 5-years lagged effect of competition in low- and medium-MCAP economies, while it remains insignificant to weakly negative in high-MCAP countries. Overall, the findings underscore the value of functional data methods in uncovering evolving and lag-dependent poverty-competition linkages that static panel models fail to capture.

Conclusion: 该方法为成本敏感二元分类提供了简化的高斯推断框架，并在模拟研究和国家JTPA研究中得到验证。

Abstract: We develop methods for nonparametric uniform inference in cost-sensitive binary classification, a framework that encompasses maximum score estimation, predicting utility maximizing actions, and policy learning. These problems are well known for slow convergence rates and non-standard limiting behavior, even under point identified parametric frameworks. In nonparametric settings, they may further suffer from failures of identification. To address these challenges, we introduce a strictly convex surrogate loss that point-identifies a representative nonparametric policy function. We then estimate this surrogate policy to conduct inference on both the optimal classification policy and the optimal policy value. This approach enables Gaussian inference, substantially simplifying empirical implementation relative to working directly with the original classification problem. In particular, we establish root-$n$ asymptotic normality for the optimal policy value and derive a Gaussian approximation for the optimal classification policy at the standard nonparametric rate. Extensive simulation studies corroborate the theoretical findings. We apply our method to the National JTPA Study to conduct inference on the optimal treatment assignment policy and its associated welfare.
