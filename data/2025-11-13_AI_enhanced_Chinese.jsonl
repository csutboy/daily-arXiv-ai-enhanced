Although this ownership structure grants decision-making autonomy, it places a burden of responsibility on cooperative's board members. Most board members lack the resources or expertise to manage properties and their energy consumption. This ignorance presents a unique challenge, especially given the EU directives that prohibit buildings rated as energy classes F and G by 2033. Conversational agents (CAs) enable human-like interactions with computer systems, facilitating human-computer interaction across various domains. In our case, CAs can be implemented to support cooperative members in making informed energy retrofitting and usage decisions. This paper introduces a Conversational agent system, called SPARA, designed to advise cooperatives on energy efficiency. SPARA functions as an energy efficiency advisor by leveraging the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework with a Language Model(LM). The LM generates targeted recommendations based on a knowledge base composed of email communications between professional energy advisors and cooperatives' representatives in Stockholm. The preliminary results indicate that SPARA can provide energy efficiency advice with precision 80\\%, comparable to that of municipal energy efficiency (EE) experts. A pilot implementation is currently underway, where municipal EE experts are evaluating SPARA performance based on questions posed to EE experts by BRF members. Our findings suggest that LMs can significantly improve outreach by supporting stakeholders in their energy transition. For future work, more research is needed to evaluate this technology, particularly limitations to the stability and trustworthiness of its energy efficiency advice.", "AI": {"tldr": "SPARA\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u4e3a\u745e\u5178\u4f4f\u623f\u5408\u4f5c\u793e\u63d0\u4f9b\u80fd\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u5176\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u53ef\u8fbe80%\uff0c\u4e0e\u5e02\u653f\u80fd\u6e90\u4e13\u5bb6\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "motivation": "\u745e\u5178\u4f4f\u623f\u5408\u4f5c\u793e\u7684\u8463\u4e8b\u4f1a\u6210\u5458\u901a\u5e38\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7ba1\u7406\u7269\u4e1a\u548c\u80fd\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u7684\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u800c\u6b27\u76df\u6307\u4ee4\u8981\u6c42\u57282033\u5e74\u524d\u7981\u6b62F\u548cG\u7ea7\u80fd\u6548\u5efa\u7b51\uff0c\u8fd9\u7ed9\u5408\u4f5c\u793e\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e13\u4e1a\u80fd\u6e90\u987e\u95ee\u4e0e\u65af\u5fb7\u54e5\u5c14\u6469\u5408\u4f5c\u793e\u4ee3\u8868\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u90ae\u4ef6\u901a\u4fe1\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u751f\u6210\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "result": "\u521d\u6b65\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793aSPARA\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe80%\u7684\u80fd\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u76ee\u524d\u6b63\u5728\u8fdb\u884c\u8bd5\u70b9\u5b9e\u65bd\uff0c\u7531\u5e02\u653f\u80fd\u6e90\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u80fd\u6e90\u8f6c\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u8be5\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5176\u80fd\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u5efa\u8bae\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u9650\u5236\u3002"}}

The adapted scale demonstrated good reliability (Cronbach's \u03b1 = 0.78) and participants rated it as understandable and relevant. While overall aspiration-related scores did not differ significantly by access to Large Language Models (LLMs), those with access reported marginally higher scores on the Avenues subscale (p = .056), suggesting broader perceived pathways to achieving educational aspirations.

A case study of data consent mechanisms in web-scraped vision-language AI training datasets", "comment": null, "summary": "The internet has become the main source of data to train modern text-to-image or vision-language models, yet it is increasingly unclear whether web-scale data collection practices for training AI systems adequately respect data owners' wishes. Ignoring the owner's indication of consent around data usage not only raises ethical concerns but also has recently been elevated into lawsuits around copyright infringement cases. In this work, we aim to reveal information about data owners' consent to AI scraping and training, and study how it's expressed in DataComp, a popular dataset of 12.8 billion text-image pairs. We examine both the sample-level information, including the copyright notice, watermarking, and metadata, and the web-domain-level information, such as a site's Terms of Service (ToS) and Robots Exclusion Protocol. We estimate at least 122M of samples exhibit some indication of copyright notice in CommonPool, and find that 60\\% of the samples in the top 50 domains come from websites with ToS that prohibit scraping.

As an example, we explore plans operating in a single county in New Jersey between 2018 and 2023. A dataset of benefits from publicly available data sources was created and the variance inflation factor was applied to identify the correlation between the extracted features, to avoid multicollinearity and overparameterization problems. We categorized the variable Market Share and used it as a multinomial response variable with three categories: less than 0.3\\%, 0.3\\% to 1.5\\%, and over 1.5\\%. Categories were chosen to achieve approximately uniform distribution of plans (47, 60, and 65 respectively). We built a multinomial Lasso model using 5-fold cross-validation to tune the penalty parameter. Lasso forced some features to be dropped from the model, which reduces the risk of overfitting and increases the interpretability of the results. For each category, important variables are different. Certain brands drive market share, as do PPO plans and prescription drug coverage. Benefits, particularly ancillary benefits that are not part of CMS's required benefits, appear to have little influence, while financial terms such as deductibles, copays, and out-of-pocket limits are associated with higher market share. Finally, we evaluated the predictive accuracy of the Lasso model with the test set.

Building on the Cauchy estimation framework, we propose two novel tests: one based on $t$-statistic group inference and the other employing a hybrid approach that combines Cauchy and OLS estimation. These methods effectively mitigate size distortions that commonly arise in standard inference procedures under endogeneity, near nonstationarity, heavy tails, and persistent volatility. The proposed tests are simple to implement and applicable to both continuous- and discrete-time models. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate favorable finite-sample performance across a range of realistic settings. An empirical application examines the predictability of excess stock returns using the dividend-price and earnings-price ratios as predictors. The results suggest that the dividend-price ratio possesses predictive power, whereas the earnings-price ratio does not significantly forecast returns.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u56de\u5f52\u63a8\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u67ef\u897f\u4f30\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u5185\u751f\u6301\u4e45\u6027\u3001\u91cd\u5c3e\u56de\u5f52\u53d8\u91cf\u548c\u6301\u4e45\u6ce2\u52a8\u7387\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6\u63a8\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5185\u751f\u6027\u3001\u63a5\u8fd1\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\u3001\u91cd\u5c3e\u548c\u6301\u4e45\u6ce2\u52a8\u7387\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u5c3a\u5bf8\u626d\u66f2\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u63a8\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u67ef\u897f\u4f30\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86t\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\u7ec4\u63a8\u65ad\u548c\u7ed3\u5408\u67ef\u897f\u4e0eOLS\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e24\u79cd\u65b0\u68c0\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u62df\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u73b0\u5b9e\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5e94\u7528\u53d1\u73b0\u80a1\u606f\u4ef7\u683c\u6bd4\u5177\u6709\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u800c\u76c8\u5229\u4ef7\u683c\u6bd4\u6ca1\u6709\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u6807\u51c6\u63a8\u65ad\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u5c3a\u5bf8\u626d\u66f2\uff0c\u7b80\u5355\u6613\u7528\u4e14\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8fde\u7eed\u548c\u79bb\u6563\u65f6\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

We study the multi-source detection problem: given snapshot observations of node infection status on a graph, estimate the set of source nodes that initiated the propagation. Existing methods either lack statistical guarantees or are limited to specific diffusion models and assumptions. We propose a novel conformal prediction framework that provides statistically valid recall guarantees for source set detection, independent of the underlying diffusion process or data distribution. Our approach introduces principled score functions to quantify the alignment between predicted probabilities and true sources, and leverages a calibration set to construct prediction sets with user-specified recall and coverage levels. The method is applicable to both single- and multi-source scenarios, supports general network diffusion dynamics, and is computationally efficient for large graphs.

This is significantly amplified in mobile scenarios, where the channel impulse response (CIR) becomes time-varying and stochastic. Obtaining accurate Channel State Information (CSI) for traditional model-based detection is intractable in such dynamic environments. While deep learning (DL) offers adaptability, its complexity is unsuitable for resource-constrained micro/nanodevices. This paper proposes a low-complexity Reservoir Computing (RC) based detector. The RC architecture utilizes a fixed, recurrent non-linear reservoir to project the time-varying received signal into a high-dimensional state space. This effectively transforms the complex temporal detection problem into a simple linear classification task, capturing ISI dynamics without explicit channel modeling or complex retraining. Evaluated in a realistic 3D mobile MC simulation environment (Smoldyn), our RC detector significantly outperforms classical detectors and achieves superior performance compared to complex ML methods (LSTM, CNN, MLP) under severe ISI. Importantly, RC achieves this with significantly fewer trainable parameters (e.g., 300 vs. up to 264k for MLP) and ultra-low latency inference (approx. 1 $\u03bc$s per symbol).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u50a8\u5c42\u8ba1\u7b97\uff08RC\uff09\u7684\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5206\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u79fb\u52a8\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4e25\u91cdISI\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u548c\u590d\u6742ML\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5c11\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u8d85\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5206\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u5728\u79fb\u52a8\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u4e25\u91cdISI\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u6d4b\u9700\u8981\u51c6\u786eCSI\u4f46\u96be\u4ee5\u83b7\u53d6\uff0c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u867d\u5177\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4f46\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u5fae/\u7eb3\u8bbe\u5907\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u3001\u5faa\u73af\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u50a8\u5c42\u5c06\u65f6\u53d8\u63a5\u6536\u4fe1\u53f7\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u9ad8\u7ef4\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5c06\u590d\u6742\u65f6\u5e8f\u68c0\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7b80\u5355\u7ebf\u6027\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u4fe1\u9053\u5efa\u6a21\u6216\u590d\u6742\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u57283D\u79fb\u52a8MC\u4eff\u771f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0cRC\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u4e25\u91cdISI\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u590d\u6742ML\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08LSTM\u3001CNN\u3001MLP\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u5c11\uff08300 vs 264k\uff09\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6781\u4f4e\uff08\u7ea61\u03bcs/\u7b26\u53f7\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "RC\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u4e3a\u79fb\u52a8\u5206\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u4e25\u91cdISI\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u8bbe\u5907\u3002"}}

To address this, our work advances a current state-of-the-art graph sparsification algorithm, maximizing algebraic connectivity (MAC). MAC is a sparsification method that preserves estimation performance by maximizing the algebraic connectivity, a spectral graph property that is directly connected to the estimation error. Unfortunately, MAC remains computationally prohibitive for online use and requires users to manually pre-specify a connectivity-preserving edge set. Our contributions close these gaps along three complementary fronts: we develop a specialized solver for algebraic connectivity that yields an average 2x runtime speedup; we investigate advanced step size strategies for MAC's optimization procedure to enhance both convergence speed and solution quality; and we propose automatic schemes that guarantee graph connectivity without requiring manual specification of edges. Together, these contributions make MAC more scalable, reliable, and suitable for real-time estimation applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u56fe\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5MAC\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f00\u53d1\u4e13\u7528\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u3001\u4f18\u5316\u6b65\u957f\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u8fde\u901a\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u66f4\u9002\u5408\u5b9e\u65f6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u56fe\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5927\u578b\u957f\u671f\u56fe\u4e0a\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5dee\uff0cMAC\u7b97\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u4f30\u8ba1\u6027\u80fd\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u9700\u8981\u624b\u52a8\u6307\u5b9a\u8fde\u901a\u8fb9\u96c6\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u7ebf\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e13\u7528\u4ee3\u6570\u8fde\u901a\u6027\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff082\u500d\u52a0\u901f\uff09\u3001\u4f18\u5316MAC\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u6b65\u957f\u7b56\u7565\u3001\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u52a8\u8fde\u901a\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6539\u8fdb\u4f7fMAC\u7b97\u6cd5\u66f4\u52a0\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u5b9e\u65f6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86MAC\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u74f6\u9888\u548c\u624b\u52a8\u914d\u7f6e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u6210\u4e3a\u66f4\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u56fe\u4f30\u8ba1\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Over the last decade, site-occupancy models have been advanced as a promising framework to analyse such loosely structured, opportunistically collected datasets. Current approaches often ignore important aspects of the detection process and do not fully capitalise on the information present in these datasets, leaving opportunities for fine-grained spatiotemporal backcasting untouched. We propose a flexible Bayesian spatiotemporal site-occupancy model that aims to mimic the data-generating process that underlies common citizen science datasets sourced from public biodiversity portals, and yields rich biological output. We illustrate the use of the model to a dataset containing over 3M butterfly records in Belgium, collected through the citizen science data portal Observations.be. We show that the proposed approach enables retrospective predictions on the occupancy of species through time and space at high resolution, as well as inference on inter-annual distributional trends, range dynamics, habitat preferences, phenological patterns, detection patterns and observer heterogeneity. The proposed model can be used to increase the value of opportunistically collected data by naturalists and citizen scientists, and can aid the understanding of spatiotemporal dynamics of species for which rigorously collected data are absent or too costly to collect.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u65f6\u7a7a\u7ad9\u70b9\u5360\u7528\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u516c\u6c11\u79d1\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u56de\u6eaf\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u63a8\u65ad\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7ad9\u70b9\u5360\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u5f80\u5f80\u5ffd\u7565\u68c0\u6d4b\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u516c\u6c11\u79d1\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u56de\u6eaf\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u65f6\u7a7a\u7ad9\u70b9\u5360\u7528\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u516c\u6c11\u79d1\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u6bd4\u5229\u65f6\u8d85\u8fc7300\u4e07\u6761\u8774\u8776\u8bb0\u5f55\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u56de\u6eaf\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u63a8\u65ad\u5e74\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\u8d8b\u52bf\u3001\u8303\u56f4\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u6816\u606f\u5730\u504f\u597d\u3001\u7269\u5019\u6a21\u5f0f\u3001\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u89c2\u5bdf\u8005\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u673a\u4f1a\u6027\u6536\u96c6\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u7406\u89e3\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e25\u683c\u6536\u96c6\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7269\u79cd\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u52a8\u6001\u3002"}}

It is a tremendously powerful tool for describing and solving combinatorial problems. Like any other language, ASP requires users to learn how it works and the syntax involved. It is becoming increasingly required for those unfamiliar with programming languages to interact with code. This paper proposes a novel method of translating unconstrained English into ASP programs for logic puzzles using an LLM and Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) graphs. Everything from ASP rules, facts, and constraints is generated to fully represent and solve the desired problem. Example logic puzzles are used to demonstrate the capabilities of the system. While most current methods rely entirely on an LLM, our system minimizes the role of the LLM only to complete straightforward tasks. The LLM is used to simplify natural language sentences, identify keywords, and generate simple facts. The AMR graphs are then parsed from simplified language and used to generate ASP constraints systematically. The system successfully creates an entire ASP program that solves a combinatorial logic problem. This approach is a significant first step in creating a lighter-weight, explainable system that converts natural language to solve complex logic problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u548cAMR\u56fe\u5c06\u82f1\u8bed\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3aASP\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u903b\u8f91\u8c1c\u9898\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9LLM\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u521b\u5efa\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "ASP\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u95ee\u9898\u6c42\u89e3\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u5b66\u4e60\u8bed\u6cd5\u3002\u968f\u7740\u975e\u7f16\u7a0b\u4eba\u5458\u4e0e\u4ee3\u7801\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba9\u4e0d\u719f\u6089\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u4eba\u4e5f\u80fd\u4f7f\u7528ASP\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u7b80\u5316\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u53e5\u5b50\u3001\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\u548c\u751f\u6210\u7b80\u5355\u4e8b\u5b9e\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7AMR\u56fe\u89e3\u6790\u7b80\u5316\u540e\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u751f\u6210ASP\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u521b\u5efa\u5b8c\u6574\u7684ASP\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002", "result": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u6210\u529f\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u5b8c\u6574\u7684ASP\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u7ec4\u5408\u903b\u8f91\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5904\u7406\u903b\u8f91\u8c1c\u9898\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u662f\u521b\u5efa\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5230\u590d\u6742\u903b\u8f91\u95ee\u9898\u6c42\u89e3\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u91cd\u5927\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b65\uff0c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u4e86LLM\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002"}}

This proportion varies according to the periods analyzed. In this paper, we use a large language model (LLM) to construct a generative agent (GA) that determines the probability of adopting one of the two strategies based on current information. The probabilities of strategy adoption are compared with those in the HAM literature for the S\\&P 500 index between 1990 and 2020.

We introduce a novel community detection method, based on Ricci flow on graphs. Our technique iteratively updates edge weights (their metric lengths) according to their (combinatorial) Foster version of Ricci curvature computed from effective resistance distance between the nodes. The latter computation is known to be done by pseudo-inverting the graph Laplacian matrix. At that, our approach is alternative to one based on Ollivier-Ricci geometric flow for community detection on graphs, significantly outperforming it in terms of computation time. In our proposed method, iterations of Foster-Ricci flow that highlight network regions of different curvature -- are followed by a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) separation heuristic. That allows to classify edges into ''strong'' (intra-community) and ''weak'' (inter-community) groups, followed by a systematic pruning of the former to isolate communities. We benchmark our algorithm on synthetic networks generated from the Stochastic Block Model (SBM), evaluating performance with the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI).

However, as matrix size grows, interconnect resistance increasingly degrades computational accuracy and limits circuit scalability. Modeling and evaluating these effects are therefore critical for developing effective mitigation strategies. Traditional SPICE (Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis) simulators, which rely on modified nodal analysis, become prohibitively slow for large-scale AMC circuits due to the quadratic growth of nodes and feedback connections. In this work, we model AMC circuits with interconnect resistance for two key operations-matrix inversion (INV) and eigenvector computation (EGV), and propose fast solving algorithms tailored for each case. The algorithms exploit the sparsity of the Jacobian matrix, enabling rapid and accurate solutions. Compared to SPICE, they achieve several orders of magnitude acceleration while maintaining high accuracy. We further extend the approach to open-loop matrix-vector multiplication (MVM) circuits, demonstrating similar efficiency gains. Finally, leveraging these fast solvers, we develop a bias-based compensation strategy that reduces interconnect-induced errors by over 50% for INV and 70% for EGV circuits. It also reveals the scaling behavior of the optimal bias with respect to matrix size and interconnect resistance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8eRRAM\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u77e9\u9635\u8ba1\u7b97\u7535\u8def\u4e2d\u4e92\u8fde\u7535\u963b\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u6c42\u89e3\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edfSPICE\u4eff\u771f\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u51e0\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u504f\u7f6e\u7684\u8865\u507f\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e92\u8fde\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u77e9\u9635\u5c3a\u5bf8\u589e\u5927\uff0c\u4e92\u8fde\u7535\u963b\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5e76\u9650\u5236\u7535\u8def\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u4f20\u7edfSPICE\u4eff\u771f\u5668\u7531\u4e8e\u8282\u70b9\u548c\u53cd\u9988\u8fde\u63a5\u7684\u4e8c\u6b21\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21AMC\u7535\u8def\u4e2d\u53d8\u5f97\u6781\u5176\u7f13\u6162\u3002", "method": "\u9488\u5bf9\u77e9\u9635\u6c42\u9006\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u5411\u91cf\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e24\u79cd\u5173\u952e\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5229\u7528\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\u77e9\u9635\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u6c42\u89e3\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5f00\u73af\u77e9\u9635\u5411\u91cf\u4e58\u6cd5\u7535\u8def\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4SPICE\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u51e0\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff1b\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u504f\u7f6e\u8865\u507f\u7b56\u7565\u5c06\u4e92\u8fde\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8650%\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff08\u77e9\u9635\u6c42\u9006\uff09\u548c70%\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff08\u7279\u5f81\u5411\u91cf\u8ba1\u7b97\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u6a21\u62df\u5927\u89c4\u6a21AMC\u7535\u8def\uff0c\u504f\u7f6e\u8865\u507f\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u4e92\u8fde\u7535\u963b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6700\u4f18\u504f\u7f6e\u968f\u77e9\u9635\u5c3a\u5bf8\u548c\u4e92\u8fde\u7535\u963b\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u89c4\u5f8b\u3002"}}

Yet, humans often remain passive observers, fascinated but uncertain how to engage. Robots, in turn, cannot reach their full potential in human-populated environments without effectively modeling human states and intentions and adapting their behavior. To achieve a synergistic human-robot collaboration (HRC), a continuous information flow should be established: humans must intuitively communicate instructions, share expertise, and express needs. In parallel, robots must clearly convey their internal state and forthcoming actions to keep users informed, comfortable, and in control. This review identifies and connects key components enabling intuitive information exchange and skill transfer between humans and robots. We examine the full interaction pipeline: from the human-to-robot communication bridge translating multimodal inputs into robot-understandable representations, through adaptive planning and role allocation, to the control layer and feedback mechanisms to close the loop. Finally, we highlight trends and promising directions toward more adaptive, accessible HRC.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u7efc\u8ff0\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5b9e\u73b0\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u540c\u5408\u4f5c\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u76f4\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u4ea4\u6362\u548c\u6280\u80fd\u8f6c\u79fb\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4ece\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8f93\u5165\u5230\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u53ef\u7406\u89e3\u8868\u793a\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u89d2\u8272\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u63a7\u5236\u5c42\u548c\u53cd\u9988\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u548cAI\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u73af\u5883\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u4eba\u7c7b\u5f80\u5f80\u53ea\u662f\u88ab\u52a8\u89c2\u5bdf\u8005\u3002\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8981\u5728\u4eba\u7c7b\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u53d1\u6325\u5168\u90e8\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6709\u6548\u5efa\u6a21\u4eba\u7c7b\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u610f\u56fe\u5e76\u8c03\u6574\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u534f\u540c\u7684\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u7acb\u8fde\u7eed\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\uff1a\u4eba\u7c7b\u76f4\u89c9\u5730\u4f20\u8fbe\u6307\u4ee4\u3001\u5206\u4eab\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u8868\u8fbe\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6e05\u6670\u4f20\u8fbe\u5185\u90e8\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u5373\u5c06\u91c7\u53d6\u7684\u884c\u52a8\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u5ba1\u67e5\u4e86\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4eba\u673a\u901a\u4fe1\u6865\u6881\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u89d2\u8272\u5206\u914d\u3001\u63a7\u5236\u5c42\u548c\u53cd\u9988\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u8fde\u63a5\u4e86\u5b9e\u73b0\u4eba\u673a\u95f4\u76f4\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u4ea4\u6362\u548c\u6280\u80fd\u8f6c\u79fb\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u4ea4\u4e92\u7ba1\u9053\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u3001\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u7684\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u8d8b\u52bf\u548c\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5efa\u7acb\u53cc\u5411\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5b9e\u73b0\u771f\u6b63\u534f\u540c\u4eba\u673a\u5408\u4f5c\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

Elective weekday procedures with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Physical Status 1-4 were included. Pre-specified preoperative predictors comprised surgical context (year, month, weekday, scheduled duration, general anaesthesia indicator, body position) and patient factors (sex, age, body mass index, allergy, infection, comorbidity, ASA). Missing data were addressed by multiple imputation by chained equations. Four learners (elastic-net, generalised additive models, random forest, gradient-boosted trees) were tuned within internal-external cross-validation (IECV; leave-one-cluster-out by centre-year) and combined by stacked generalisation to predict log-transformed duration.\n  Results: We analysed 63,206 procedures (development 45,647; temporal test 17,559). Cluster-specific and pooled errors and calibrations from IECV are provided with consistent performance across centres and years. In the 2024 temporal test cohort, calibration was good (intercept 0.423, 95%CI 0.372 to 0.474; slope 0.921, 95%CI 0.911 to 0.932).\n  Conclusions: A stacked machine-learning model using only widely available preoperative variables achieved accurate, well-calibrated predictions in temporal external validation, supporting transportability across sites and over time.

Although humans effortlessly solve ARC-AGI, it remains extremely difficult for even the most advanced artificial intelligence systems. Inspired by methods for modelling human intelligence spanning neuroscience to psychology, we propose a cognitively plausible ARC-AGI solver. Our solver integrates System 1 intuitions with System 2 reasoning in an efficient and interpretable process using neurosymbolic methods based on Vector Symbolic Algebras (VSAs). Our solver works by object-centric program synthesis, leveraging VSAs to represent abstract objects, guide solution search, and enable sample-efficient neural learning. Preliminary results indicate success, with our solver scoring 10.8% on ARC-AGI-1-Train and 3.0% on ARC-AGI-1-Eval. Additionally, our solver performs well on simpler benchmarks, scoring 94.5% on Sort-of-ARC and 83.1% on 1D-ARC -- the latter outperforming GPT-4 at a tiny fraction of the computational cost. Importantly, our approach is unique; we believe we are the first to apply VSAs to ARC-AGI and have developed the most cognitively plausible ARC-AGI solver yet.

I also find that NotebookLM not only translates texts from other languages into a perky standardised Mid-Western American accent, it also translates cultural contexts to a white, educated, middle-class American default. This is a distinct development in how publics are shaped by media, marking a departure from the multiple public spheres that scholars have described in human podcasting from the early 2000s until today, where hosts spoke to specific communities and responded to listener comments, to an abstraction of the podcast genre.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5206\u6790Google NotebookLM\u751f\u6210\u7684AI\u64ad\u5ba2\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u91c7\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u6a21\u677f\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u4e0d\u540c\u6587\u672c\u548c\u6587\u5316\u80cc\u666f\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u4e3a\u7f8e\u56fd\u4e2d\u897f\u90e8\u767d\u4eba\u3001\u4e2d\u4ea7\u9636\u7ea7\u3001\u53d7\u8fc7\u6559\u80b2\u7684\u6587\u5316\u9ed8\u8ba4\uff0c\u8fd9\u6539\u53d8\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u64ad\u5ba2\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u5143\u516c\u5171\u9886\u57df\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "AI\u751f\u6210\u7684\u64ad\u5ba2\u867d\u7136\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5de5\u5177\u88ab\u8ba8\u8bba\uff0c\u4f46\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5a92\u4f53\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u5206\u6790AI\u64ad\u5ba2\u5982\u4f55\u6784\u5efa\u5185\u5bb9\u548c\u5851\u9020\u516c\u4f17\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u4f20\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5230Google NotebookLM\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u751f\u6210\u7684\u64ad\u5ba2\u8f93\u51fa\u5185\u5bb9\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u6587\u5316\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u64ad\u5ba2\u7ed3\u6784\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fa\u5b9a\u6a21\u677f\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5c06\u5176\u4ed6\u8bed\u8a00\u6587\u672c\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u7684\u7f8e\u56fd\u4e2d\u897f\u90e8\u53e3\u97f3\uff0c\u8fd8\u5c06\u6587\u5316\u80cc\u666f\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u767d\u4eba\u3001\u4e2d\u4ea7\u9636\u7ea7\u3001\u53d7\u8fc7\u6559\u80b2\u7684\u7f8e\u56fd\u6587\u5316\u9ed8\u8ba4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u6807\u5fd7\u7740\u5a92\u4f53\u5851\u9020\u516c\u4f17\u65b9\u5f0f\u7684\u663e\u8457\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u4ece\u4f20\u7edf\u64ad\u5ba2\u7684\u591a\u5143\u516c\u5171\u9886\u57df\u8f6c\u5411\u64ad\u5ba2\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u62bd\u8c61\u5316\u3002"}}

We systematically searched five academic databases and grey literature following PRISMA guidelines and included 53 empirical studies that met predefined eligibility criteria. For each study we assessed risk of bias, with particular attention to how endogeneity, selection bias, and confounding were handled. Because of substantial heterogeneity in outcomes and research designs, results were synthesized narratively rather than through meta analysis. We find that a minority of studies, often using methods with higher risk of bias such as propensity score matching, report no systematic adverse social effects. By contrast, a large body of work using stronger quasi experimental designs, especially instrumental variable strategies, links IMF conditionality to higher income inequality, worse health outcomes (notably tuberculosis and child mortality), and growth of the informal economy. Overall, the best available evidence indicates that IMF programs, particularly those centered on fiscal austerity and structural reforms, impose significant social costs and that a redesign of conditionality is needed to protect social spending and advance the Sustainable Development Goals.", "AI": {"tldr": "IMF\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u7efc\u8ff0\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528\u51c6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u793a\uff0cIMF\u6761\u4ef6\u6027\u4f1a\u52a0\u5267\u6536\u5165\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\u3001\u6076\u5316\u5065\u5eb7\u72b6\u51b5\u5e76\u4fc3\u8fdb\u975e\u6b63\u89c4\u7ecf\u6d4e\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u800c\u5c11\u6570\u4f7f\u7528\u503e\u5411\u5f97\u5206\u5339\u914d\u7b49\u504f\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u672a\u53d1\u73b0\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8d1f\u9762\u793e\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u56fd\u9645\u8d27\u5e01\u57fa\u91d1\u7ec4\u7ec7\uff08IMF\uff09\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u5bf9\u5185\u751f\u6027\u3001\u9009\u62e9\u504f\u501a\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528PRISMA\u6307\u5357\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7efc\u8ff0\u548c\u53d9\u8ff0\u6027\u7efc\u5408\uff0c\u68c0\u7d225\u4e2a\u5b66\u672f\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u548c\u7070\u8272\u6587\u732e\uff0c\u7eb3\u516553\u9879\u7b26\u5408\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6bcf\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u504f\u501a\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u591a\u6570\u4f7f\u7528\u66f4\u5f3a\u51c6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5de5\u5177\u53d8\u91cf\u7b56\u7565\uff09\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0IMF\u6761\u4ef6\u6027\u4e0e\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6536\u5165\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\u3001\u66f4\u5dee\u7684\u5065\u5eb7\u7ed3\u679c\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u7ed3\u6838\u75c5\u548c\u513f\u7ae5\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7387\uff09\u4ee5\u53ca\u975e\u6b63\u89c4\u7ecf\u6d4e\u589e\u957f\u76f8\u5173\u3002\u5c11\u6570\u4f7f\u7528\u504f\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u672a\u53d1\u73b0\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8d1f\u9762\u793e\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f73\u8bc1\u636e\u8868\u660eIMF\u9879\u76ee\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u4ee5\u8d22\u653f\u7d27\u7f29\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u6539\u9769\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u9879\u76ee\uff09\u4f1a\u9020\u6210\u663e\u8457\u793e\u4f1a\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6761\u4ef6\u6027\u4ee5\u4fdd\u62a4\u793e\u4f1a\u652f\u51fa\u5e76\u63a8\u8fdb\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u53d1\u5c55\u76ee\u6807\u3002"}}

This paper studies a planar graph dismantling problem under an edge-budget constraint. We propose a spanning-tree-skeleton dual-path framework that first samples multiple uniform spanning trees to capture network backbones and then adaptively selects between two complementary paths according to the budget. The small-budget path estimates a dismantlable subgraph fraction using a logarithmic density feature, while the large-budget path predicts the optimal partition count through a slope-based model. Experiments on random planar graphs demonstrate near-linear runtime scaling, consistent reductions in the largest connected component ratio, and clear budget-fragmentation trends.

To address the inherent complexity of hybrid optical-radio environments, a high-fidelity Digital Twin (DT) is developed within the Network Simulator 3 (NS-3) platform. The DT models deploy subsystems of the RIoT architecture, including radio frequency (RF) communication, optical wireless communication (OWC), and energy harvesting and consumption mechanisms that enable autonomous operation. Real-time energy and power measurements from target hardware platforms are also incorporated to ensure accurate representation of physical behavior and enable runtime analysis and optimization. Building on this foundation, a proactive cross-layer optimization strategy is devised to balance energy efficiency and quality of service (QoS).

A game-based coupled migration framework characterized by antisymmetric matrices is first established to facilitate the coordination of cross-regional resource allocation between VPPs. To address the challenge posed to conventional probabilistic modeling by the inherent data sparsity of DC workloads, deterministic equivalent transformations of fuzzy chance constraints are derived based on fuzzy set theory, and non-convex stochastic problems are transformed into a solvable second-order cone program. To address the multi-player interest coordination problem in cooperative games, an improved Shapley value profit allocation method with the VPP operator as intermediary is proposed to achieve a balance between theoretical fairness and computational feasibility. In addition, the alternating direction method of multipliers with consensus-based variable splitting is introduced to solve the high-dimensional non-convex optimization problem, transforming coupled antisymmetric constraints into separable subproblems with analytical solutions. Simulations based on real data from Google's multiple DCs demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in improving DR curve tracking precision and reducing operational costs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u865a\u62df\u7535\u5382\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8026\u5408\u8fc1\u79fb\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u535a\u5f08\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u6a21\u7cca\u673a\u4f1a\u7ea6\u675f\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u9700\u6c42\u54cd\u5e94\u66f2\u7ebf\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u8fd0\u8425\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u865a\u62df\u7535\u5382\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u534f\u540c\u8c03\u5ea6\u4e2d\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u5bf9\u4f20\u7edf\u6982\u7387\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u54cd\u5e94\u66f2\u7ebf\u8ddf\u8e2a\u3002", "method": "\u5efa\u7acb\u57fa\u4e8e\u53cd\u5bf9\u79f0\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u535a\u5f08\u8026\u5408\u8fc1\u79fb\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6a21\u7cca\u96c6\u7406\u8bba\u8fdb\u884c\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7b49\u4ef7\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6539\u8fdb\u7684Shapley\u503c\u5229\u6da6\u5206\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u4ea4\u66ff\u65b9\u5411\u4e58\u5b50\u6cd5\u6c42\u89e3\u9ad8\u7ef4\u975e\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u8c37\u6b4c\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u4eff\u771f\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u9700\u6c42\u54cd\u5e94\u66f2\u7ebf\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u8fd0\u8425\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u80fd\u91cf-\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u8026\u5408\u8fc1\u79fb\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u534f\u8c03\u8de8\u533a\u57df\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7406\u8bba\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u8ba1\u7b97\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u865a\u62df\u7535\u5382\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u534f\u540c\u8fd0\u8425\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

These perception modules are vulnerable to epistemic uncertainty, often failing when encountering out-of-distribution (OoD) measurements not seen during training. To address this gap, we introduce ATOM-CBF (Adaptive-To-OoD-Measurement Control Barrier Function), a novel safe control framework that explicitly computes and adapts to the epistemic uncertainty from OoD measurements, without the need for ground-truth labels or information on distribution shifts. Our approach features two key components: (1) an OoD-aware adaptive perception error margin and (2) a safety filter that integrates this adaptive error margin, enabling the filter to adjust its conservatism in real-time.

A widely accepted hypothesis is that these spatial patterns are correlated with morphology of the cells and their nuclei. Nevertheless, tools to quantify the correlation, with uncertainty, are scarce, and the state-of-the-art is based on low-dimensional numerical summaries of the shapes that are inadequate to fully encode shape information. To this end, we propose a marked point process framework to assess spatial correlation among shapes of planar closed curves, which represent cell or nuclei outlines. With shapes of curves as marks, the framework is based on a mark-weighted $K$ function, a second-order spatial statistic that accounts for the marks' variation by using test functions that capture only the shapes of cells and their nuclei.

We challenge this paradigm by asking: what if we explicitly architected RL systems as inference engines that can answer diverse queries about their environment? In deterministic settings, trained agents implicitly encode rich knowledge about reachability, distances, values, and dynamics - yet current architectures are not designed to expose this information efficiently. We introduce Query Conditioned Deterministic Inference Networks (QDIN), a unified architecture that treats different types of queries (policy, reachability, paths, comparisons) as first-class citizens, with specialized neural modules optimized for each inference pattern. Our key empirical finding reveals a fundamental decoupling: inference accuracy can reach near-perfect levels (99% reachability IoU) even when control performance remains suboptimal (31% return), suggesting that the representations needed for accurate world knowledge differ from those required for optimal control. Experiments demonstrate that query specialized architectures outperform both unified models and post-hoc extraction methods, while maintaining competitive control performance.

These efforts often operationalize justice at the upper and lower bounds of its continuum, defining it in terms of progressiveness or reform. Before characterizing the type of justice an AI tool should have baked in, we argue for a systematic discovery of how justice is executed by the recipient system: a method the Value Sensitive Design (VSD) framework terms Value Source analysis. The present work asks: how is justice operationalized within current child welfare administrative policy and what does it teach us about how to develop AI? We conduct a mixed-methods analysis of child welfare policy in the state of New York and find a range of functional definitions of justice (which we term principles). These principles reflect more nuanced understandings of justice across a spectrum of contexts: from established concepts like fairness and equity to less common foci like the proprietary rights of parents and children.

On the one hand, agents are stubborn, i.e., have a tendency for one of the two opinions; on the other hand, there is a disruptive bias, $p\\in[0,1]$, that drives the agents toward the other opinion. The disruptive bias models external factors, such as market innovations or social controllers, aiming to challenge the status quo, while agents' stubbornness reinforces the initial opinion making it harder for the external bias to drive the process toward change. Each agent updates its opinion according to a nonlinear function of the states of its neighbors and of the bias $p$. We consider the case of random directed graphs with prescribed in- and out-degree sequences and we prove that the dynamics exhibits a phase transition: when the disruptive bias $p$ is larger than a critical threshold $p_c$, the population converges in constant time to a consensus on the disruptive opinion. Conversely, when the bias $p$ is less than $p_c$, the system enters a metastable state in which only a fraction of agents $q_\\star(p)<1$ will share the new opinion for a long time. We characterize $p_c$ and $q_\\star(p)$ explicitly, showing that they only depend on few simple statistics of the degree sequences. Our analysis relies on a dual system of branching, coalescing, and dying particles, which we show exhibits equivalent behavior and allows a rigorous characterization of the system's dynamics.

This requires users to choose a time step, which is both critical and challenging: large steps can produce non-physical artifacts, while small steps force the simulation to run slowly.

But existing error-controlled integrators struggle with the stiff dynamics of contact, and cannot meet the speed and scalability requirements of modern robotics workflows. We introduce CENIC, a new continuous-time integrator that brings together recent advances in convex time-stepping and error-controlled integration, inheriting benefits from both continuous integration and discrete time-stepping.

Most state-of-the-art POMDP solvers (offline planners) follow the point-based value iteration scheme, which performs Bellman backups on $\u03b1$-vectors at reachable belief points until convergence. However, since each $\u03b1$-vector is $|S|$-dimensional, these methods quickly become intractable for large-scale problems due to the prohibitive computational cost of Bellman backups. In this work, we demonstrate that the PWLC property allows a POMDP's value function to be alternatively represented as a finite set of neural networks. This insight enables a novel POMDP planning algorithm called \\emph{Neural Value Iteration}, which combines the generalization capability of neural networks with the classical value iteration framework. Our approach achieves near-optimal solutions even in extremely large POMDPs that are intractable for existing offline solvers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684POMDP\u89c4\u5212\u7b97\u6cd5\u2014\u2014\u795e\u7ecf\u4ef7\u503c\u8fed\u4ee3\uff0c\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u03b1\u5411\u91cf\u6765\u8868\u793a\u4ef7\u503c\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21POMDP\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfPOMDP\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u4f7f\u7528\u03b1\u5411\u91cf\u8868\u793a\u4ef7\u503c\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u03b1\u5411\u91cf\u662f|S|\u7ef4\u7684\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u95ee\u9898\u4e2dBellman\u5907\u4efd\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u9ad8\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528PWLC\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5c06POMDP\u4ef7\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u6709\u9650\u4e2a\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u96c6\u5408\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u7ecf\u5178\u4ef7\u503c\u8fed\u4ee3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u795e\u7ecf\u4ef7\u503c\u8fed\u4ee3\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u73b0\u6709\u79bb\u7ebf\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21POMDP\u4e2d\u4ecd\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21POMDP\u89c4\u5212\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u4f18\u52bf\u548c\u4f20\u7edf\u4ef7\u503c\u8fed\u4ee3\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Existing methods are primarily offline and unsuitable for real-time learning. To address this issue, we first develop a first-order gradient-based algorithm that updates parameter estimates recursively using incoming data. Considering that persistent excitation (PE) conditions are difficult to satisfy in feedback control scenarios, a second-order quasi-Newton algorithm is proposed to achieve faster convergence without requiring the PE condition. For both algorithms, corresponding versions are developed to handle known and unknown tampering strategies, and their parameter estimates are proven to converge almost surely over time. In particular, the second-order algorithm ensures convergence under a signal condition that matches the minimal excitation required by classical least-squares estimation in stochastic regression models. The second-order algorithm is also extended to an adaptive control framework, providing an explicit upper bound on the tracking error for binary-output FIR systems under unknown tampering.

However, motion planning in real-time within unknown, changing environments remains a challenge for such robots due to the high dimensionality of the configuration space and the complex collision-avoidance constraints that must be obeyed. In this work, we propose a novel way to alleviate the curse of dimensionality by leveraging the structure imposed by shared joints (e.g. torso joints) in a dual-arm robot. First, we build two dynamic roadmaps (DRM) for each kinematic chain (i.e. left arm + torso, right arm + torso) with specific structure induced by the shared joints. Then, we show that we can leverage this structure to efficiently search through the composition of the two roadmaps and largely sidestep the curse of dimensionality. Finally, we run several experiments in a real-world grocery store with this motion planner on a 19 DoF mobile manipulation robot executing a grocery fulfillment task, achieving 0.4s average planning times with 99.9% success rate across more than 2000 motion plans.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u53cc\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u5171\u4eab\u5173\u8282\u7ed3\u6784\u6784\u5efa\u52a8\u6001\u8def\u6807\u56fe\uff0c\u572819\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u79fb\u52a8\u64cd\u4f5c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b00.4\u79d2\u5e73\u5747\u89c4\u5212\u65f6\u95f4\u548c99.9%\u6210\u529f\u7387", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u9ad8\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u53cc\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u672a\u77e5\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u65f6\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u914d\u7f6e\u7a7a\u95f4\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5ea6\u548c\u590d\u6742\u907f\u969c\u7ea6\u675f\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u7ef4\u5ea6\u707e\u96be\u95ee\u9898", "method": "\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8fd0\u52a8\u94fe\uff08\u5de6\u81c2+\u8eaf\u5e72\u3001\u53f3\u81c2+\u8eaf\u5e72\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u5177\u6709\u5171\u4eab\u5173\u8282\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8def\u6807\u56fe\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u79cd\u7ed3\u6784\u9ad8\u6548\u641c\u7d22\u4e24\u4e2a\u8def\u6807\u56fe\u7684\u7ec4\u5408", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u8d85\u5e02\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u6742\u8d27\u914d\u9001\u4efb\u52a1\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u8d85\u8fc72000\u6b21\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u89c4\u5212\u65f6\u95f4\u4e3a0.4\u79d2\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u7387\u8fbe\u523099.9%", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u53cc\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5171\u4eab\u5173\u8282\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u7ef4\u5ea6\u707e\u96be\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212"}}

Models can extract more information from this data, and explainable methods can make them more accessible to practitioners. The Expected Threat model has been praised for its explainability and offers an accessible option. However, selecting the grid size is a challenging key design choice that has to be made when applying the Expected Threat model. Using a finer grid leads to a more flexible model that can better distinguish between different situations, but the accuracy of the estimates deteriorates with a more flexible model. Consequently, practitioners face challenges in balancing the trade-off between model flexibility and model accuracy. In this study, the Expected Threat model is analyzed from a theoretical perspective and simulations are performed based on the Markov chain of the model to examine its behavior in practice. Our theoretical results establish an upper bound on the error of the Expected Threat model for different flexibilities. Based on the simulations, a more accurate characterization of the model's error is provided, improving over the theoretical bound.

Recent reinforcement learning approaches address this limitation but face two critical challenges. First, they evaluate teaching effectiveness solely based on whether students produce correct outputs, unable to distinguish whether students genuinely understand or echo teacher-provided answers during interaction. Second, they cannot perceive students' evolving cognitive states in real time through interactive dialogue, thus failing to adapt teaching strategies to match students' cognitive levels dynamically. We propose the Unidirectional Cognitive Optimization (UCO) method to address these challenges. UCO uses a multi-turn interactive reinforcement learning paradigm where the innovation lies in two synergistic reward functions: the Progress Reward captures students' cognitive advancement, evaluating whether students truly transition from confusion to comprehension, while the Scaffold Reward dynamically identifies each student's Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), encouraging teachers to maintain productive teaching within this zone. We evaluate UCO by comparing it against 11 baseline models on BigMath and MathTutorBench benchmarks.

This paper studies how LLMs, through lowering writing costs, disrupt markets that traditionally relied on writing as a costly signal of quality (e.g., job applications, college essays). Using data from Freelancer.com, a major digital labor platform, we explore the effects of LLMs' disruption of labor market signaling on equilibrium market outcomes. We develop a novel LLM-based measure to quantify the extent to which an application is tailored to a given job posting. Taking the measure to the data, we find that employers have a high willingness to pay for workers with more customized applications in the period before LLMs are introduced, but not after. To isolate and quantify the effect of LLMs' disruption of signaling on equilibrium outcomes, we develop and estimate a structural model of labor market signaling, in which workers invest costly effort to produce noisy signals that predict their ability in equilibrium. We use the estimated model to simulate a counterfactual equilibrium in which LLMs render written applications useless in signaling workers' ability. Without costly signaling, employers are less able to identify high-ability workers, causing the market to become significantly less meritocratic: compared to the pre-LLM equilibrium, workers in the top quintile of the ability distribution are hired 19% less often, workers in the bottom quintile are hired 14% more often.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u964d\u4f4e\u5199\u4f5c\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u7834\u574f\u4f20\u7edf\u4f9d\u8d56\u5199\u4f5c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8d28\u91cf\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u5e02\u573a\uff08\u5982\u6c42\u804c\u7533\u8bf7\u3001\u5927\u5b66\u8bba\u6587\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u91cf\u5316\u5176\u5bf9\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u5747\u8861\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "LLMs\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5199\u4f5c\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u7834\u574f\u4f20\u7edf\u4f9d\u8d56\u5199\u4f5c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8d28\u91cf\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u5e02\u573a\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\uff0c\u6c42\u804c\u7533\u8bf7\u4f5c\u4e3a\u80fd\u529b\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u524a\u5f31\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Freelancer.com\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u6307\u6807\u91cf\u5316\u7533\u8bf7\u4fe1\u4e0e\u804c\u4f4d\u5339\u914d\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u7ed3\u6784\u6a21\u578b\u6a21\u62dfLLMs\u7834\u574f\u4fe1\u53f7\u673a\u5236\u540e\u7684\u5747\u8861\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u96c7\u4e3b\u5728LLMs\u5f15\u5165\u524d\u613f\u610f\u4e3a\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u7533\u8bf7\u652f\u4ed8\u9ad8\u4ef7\uff0c\u4f46\u5f15\u5165\u540e\u4e0d\u518d\u5982\u6b64\u3002\u6a21\u62df\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u6210\u672c\u4fe1\u53f7\u673a\u5236\u65f6\uff0c\u96c7\u4e3b\u96be\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u9ad8\u80fd\u529b\u5de5\u4f5c\u8005\uff0c\u5e02\u573a\u53d8\u5f97\u4e0d\u516c\u6b63\uff1a\u80fd\u529b\u524d20%\u5de5\u4f5c\u8005\u88ab\u96c7\u4f63\u7387\u4e0b\u964d19%\uff0c\u540e20%\u4e0a\u534714%\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMs\u901a\u8fc7\u964d\u4f4e\u5199\u4f5c\u6210\u672c\u7834\u574f\u4e86\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5e02\u573a\u6548\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\u548c\u5206\u914d\u4e0d\u516c\uff0c\u9ad8\u80fd\u529b\u5de5\u4f5c\u8005\u66f4\u96be\u88ab\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u96c7\u4f63\u3002"}}

Because it does not consider inequality constraints, using AC power flow for feasibility post-processing can violate bounds on reactive power, voltage magnitudes, or thermal limits. There remains a need for a streamlined analytical approach that can guarantee AC feasibility while adhering to variable bounds. This paper suggests an augmented implementation of AC power flow that uses an additional two bus types (PQV and P) to help resolve voltage bound violations present in the traditional approach. The proposed method sacrifices the voltage setpoint at a generator in exchange for fixing the voltage at a load bus, thereby moving a degree of freedom around the network. Results on the IEEE 14-bus, 57-bus, and 300-bus test cases demonstrate how switching bus types can reduce overall network violations and help find feasible power system setpoints.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u4ea4\u6d41\u6f6e\u6d41\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u4e24\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6bcd\u7ebf\u7c7b\u578b(PQV\u548cP)\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u7535\u538b\u8fb9\u754c\u8fdd\u89c4\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u53d1\u7535\u673a\u548c\u8d1f\u8377\u6bcd\u7ebf\u4e4b\u95f4\u91cd\u65b0\u5206\u914d\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u4ee5\u5bfb\u627e\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u5b9a\u70b9\u3002", "motivation": "\u6279\u53d1\u7535\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u901a\u5e38\u4f7f\u7528\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u4f46\u4ea4\u6d41\u6f6e\u6d41\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u540e\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u8003\u8651\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u65e0\u529f\u529f\u7387\u3001\u7535\u538b\u5e45\u503c\u6216\u70ed\u6781\u9650\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u8fdd\u89c4\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4ea4\u6d41\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u5e76\u9075\u5b88\u53d8\u91cf\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u4ea4\u6d41\u6f6e\u6d41\u5b9e\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u989d\u5916\u7684\u4e24\u79cd\u6bcd\u7ebf\u7c7b\u578b(PQV\u548cP)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u727a\u7272\u53d1\u7535\u673a\u7684\u7535\u538b\u8bbe\u5b9a\u70b9\u6765\u4fee\u590d\u8d1f\u8377\u6bcd\u7ebf\u7684\u7535\u538b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u91cd\u65b0\u5206\u914d\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728IEEE 14\u6bcd\u7ebf\u300157\u6bcd\u7ebf\u548c300\u6bcd\u7ebf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6848\u4f8b\u4e0a\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5207\u6362\u6bcd\u7ebf\u7c7b\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u6574\u4f53\u7f51\u7edc\u8fdd\u89c4\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u627e\u5230\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u5b9a\u70b9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u4ea4\u6d41\u6f6e\u6d41\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u65b0\u5206\u914d\u7f51\u7edc\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u7535\u538b\u8fb9\u754c\u8fdd\u89c4\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u8bbe\u5b9a\u70b9\u3002"}}

It processes raw pixels at 5 Hz to produce precise 30 Hz keyboard-mouse actions and adaptively invokes reasoning only when necessary. Trained in Genshin Impact, Lumine successfully completes the entire five-hour Mondstadt main storyline on par with human-level efficiency and follows natural language instructions to perform a broad spectrum of tasks in both 3D open-world exploration and 2D GUI manipulation across collection, combat, puzzle-solving, and NPC interaction. In addition to its in-domain performance, Lumine demonstrates strong zero-shot cross-game generalization. Without any fine-tuning, it accomplishes 100-minute missions in Wuthering Waves and the full five-hour first chapter of Honkai: Star Rail.

However, these approaches overlook a fundamental question: what happens when one form of recursive cognition--AI systems with their attention mechanisms, iterative processing, and feedback loops--encounters the recursive communicative processes of other species? Drawing on philosopher Yuk Hui's work on recursivity and contingency, I argue that AI systems are not neutral pattern detectors but recursive cognitive agents whose own information processing may systematically obscure or distort other species' communicative structures. This creates a double contingency problem: each species' communication emerges through contingent ecological and evolutionary conditions, while AI systems process these signals through their own contingent architectural and training conditions.

Bennhoff", "Alessandro Ferrari"], "title": "Not-so-Cleansing Recessions", "comment": null, "summary": "Recessions are periods in which the least productive firms in the economy exit, and as the economy recovers, they are replaced by new and more productive entrants. These cleansing effects improve the average firm productivity. At the same time, recessions induce a loss of varieties. We show that the long-run welfare effects trade off these two forces. This trade-off is governed by love-of-variety and the elasticity of substitution in aggregate production. If industry output is aggregated with the standard CES aggregator, recessions do not bring about any improvement in GDP and welfare. If the economy features more love-of-variety than CES, the social planner optimally subsidizes economic activity both in steady state and even more so in recessions to avoid firm exit.

In the context of networked systems, controllability is a well-established concept. However, many real-world systems, from biological collectives to engineered infrastructures, exhibit higher-order interactions that cannot be captured by simple graphs. Moreover, the way in which agents interact and influence one another is often unknown and must be inferred from partial observations of the system. Here, we close the loop between a hypergraph representation and our recently developed hypergraph inference algorithm, THIS, to infer the underlying multibody couplings. Building on the inferred structure, we design a parsimonious controller that, given a minimal set of controllable nodes, steers the system toward a desired configuration.

We expect that this redesign of the training corpus will lead to an early commitment to values from the first training token onward, such that knowledge, skills, and values are intrinsically much harder to separate.

This paper addresses this gap using detailed data on Italian graduates and university programs. I study the labor market returns to combinations of bachelor's and master's degrees and investigate how curriculum characteristics affect outcomes. I exploit exogenous variation in access to bachelor's and master's degrees to causally estimate the returns to 43 combinations of degrees. I organize the data in a nested model with exogenous variation in admission requirements and explore the preference profile of the sample through policy simulations that shift these requirements. I then relate the estimated returns to the academic curriculum of degrees, focusing on the role of quantitative education and timing of courses. I contribute to the literature on returns to advanced degrees by incorporating master's degrees in the discussion on how higher education affects outcomes and providing evidence on the characteristics of curricula that are positively related to labor market returns. The findings reveal substantial variation in returns to degree combinations, even among combinations with the same bachelor's degree, indicating the need to consider both types of programs. Combinations of degrees in different disciplines positively impact economic outcomes, while those in the same field perform worse. Successful combinations feature more non-quantitative education in the bachelor's, and quantitative courses alone do not explain higher returns.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u610f\u5927\u5229\u6bd5\u4e1a\u751f\u5b66\u4f4d\u7ec4\u5408\u5bf9\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u56de\u62a5\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5b66\u58eb\u548c\u7855\u58eb\u5b66\u4f4d\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7ed3\u679c\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u7ec4\u5408\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u800c\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bfe\u7a0b\u672c\u8eab\u4e0d\u80fd\u89e3\u91ca\u66f4\u9ad8\u56de\u62a5\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u7b49\u6559\u80b2\u9700\u8981\u9009\u62e9\u5b66\u58eb\u548c\u7855\u58eb\u5b66\u4f4d\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ec4\u5408\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u56de\u62a5\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0d\u540c\u5b66\u79d1\u8bfe\u7a0b\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u610f\u5927\u5229\u6bd5\u4e1a\u751f\u548c\u5927\u5b66\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u8be6\u7ec6\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5165\u5b66\u8981\u6c42\u7684\u5916\u751f\u53d8\u5316\u6765\u56e0\u679c\u4f30\u8ba143\u79cd\u5b66\u4f4d\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u56de\u62a5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u653f\u7b56\u6a21\u62df\u5206\u6790\u504f\u597d\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u4f30\u8ba1\u56de\u62a5\u4e0e\u5b66\u4f4d\u8bfe\u7a0b\u7279\u5f81\u76f8\u5173\u8054\u3002", "result": "\u5b66\u4f4d\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u56de\u62a5\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u662f\u540c\u4e00\u5b66\u58eb\u5b66\u4f4d\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u7ec4\u5408\uff1b\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u7ec4\u5408\u5bf9\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7ed3\u679c\u6709\u79ef\u6781\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u800c\u540c\u9886\u57df\u7ec4\u5408\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u5dee\uff1b\u6210\u529f\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u5728\u5b66\u58eb\u9636\u6bb5\u5305\u542b\u66f4\u591a\u975e\u5b9a\u91cf\u6559\u80b2\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u8981\u8003\u8651\u5b66\u58eb\u548c\u7855\u58eb\u4e24\u79cd\u5b66\u4f4d\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u7ec4\u5408\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bfe\u7a0b\u672c\u8eab\u4e0d\u80fd\u89e3\u91ca\u66f4\u9ad8\u56de\u62a5\uff0c\u8bfe\u7a0b\u8bbe\u7f6e\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5b89\u6392\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u7ed3\u679c\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

We bridge hierarchical game-theoretic modeling with online feedback optimization by casting urban mobility as a tri-level Stackelberg game (travelers, operators, municipality) closed in a feedback loop. The municipality iteratively updates taxes, subsidies, and operational constraints using a projected two-point (gradient-free) scheme, while lower levels respond through equilibrium computations (Frank-Wolfe for traveler equilibrium; operator best responses). This model-free pipeline enforces constraints, accommodates heterogeneous users and modes, and scales to higher-dimensional policy vectors without differentiating through equilibrium maps.\n  On a real multimodal network for Zurich, Switzerland, our method attains substantially better municipal objectives than Bayesian optimization and Genetic algorithms, and identifies integration incentives that increase multimodal usage while improving both operator objectives. The results show that feedback-based regulation can steer competition toward cooperative outcomes and deliver tangible welfare gains in complex, data-rich mobility ecosystems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06\u5206\u5c42\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u5728\u7ebf\u53cd\u9988\u4f18\u5316\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u57ce\u5e02\u4ea4\u901a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u4e09\u5c42Stackelberg\u535a\u5f08\uff08\u51fa\u884c\u8005\u3001\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\u3001\u5e02\u653f\u5f53\u5c40\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u9988\u5faa\u73af\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ea4\u901a\u7cfb\u7edf\u662f\u590d\u6742\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u6280\u672f\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u53d7\u591a\u4e2a\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u51b3\u7b56\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u6709\u6548\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u8fd9\u79cd\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e09\u5c42Stackelberg\u535a\u5f08\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e02\u653f\u5f53\u5c40\u901a\u8fc7\u6295\u5f71\u4e24\u70b9\uff08\u65e0\u68af\u5ea6\uff09\u65b9\u6848\u8fed\u4ee3\u66f4\u65b0\u7a0e\u6536\u3001\u8865\u8d34\u548c\u8fd0\u8425\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u4e0b\u5c42\u901a\u8fc7\u5747\u8861\u8ba1\u7b97\uff08Frank-Wolfe\u7b97\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u51fa\u884c\u8005\u5747\u8861\uff1b\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\u6700\u4f73\u54cd\u5e94\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u54cd\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u82cf\u9ece\u4e16\u771f\u5b9e\u591a\u6a21\u5f0f\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u9057\u4f20\u7b97\u6cd5\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5e02\u653f\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u80fd\u591f\u589e\u52a0\u591a\u6a21\u5f0f\u4f7f\u7528\u5e76\u6539\u5584\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u6574\u5408\u6fc0\u52b1\u63aa\u65bd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u76d1\u7ba1\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c06\u7ade\u4e89\u5f15\u5bfc\u5411\u5408\u4f5c\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u3001\u6570\u636e\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u4ea4\u901a\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u5207\u5b9e\u7684\u798f\u5229\u6536\u76ca\u3002"}}

Different case studies on networks of varying sizes demonstrate that an objective-based ADMM approach, denominated as OB-ADMM, is significantly more robust to the choice of \\r{ho}, consistently yielding solutions closer to the centralized optimal benchmark by preventing premature algorithm stopping.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684ADMM\u516c\u5f0f\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u7f51\u7edc\u5fae\u7535\u7f51\u80fd\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u5982\u4f55\u786e\u5b9a\u5408\u9002\u7684\u505c\u6b62\u70b9\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u89e3\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u57fa\u4e8e\u76ee\u6807\u7684OB-ADMM\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u60e9\u7f5a\u53c2\u6570\u03c1\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\uff0c\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "ADMM\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u60e9\u7f5a\u53c2\u6570\u03c1\u7684\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u4e0d\u5f53\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6536\u655b\u7f13\u6162\u3001\u6b21\u4f18\u89e3\u751a\u81f3\u7b97\u6cd5\u53d1\u6563\u3002", "method": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684ADMM\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u878d\u5165\u4e86\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u60e9\u7f5a\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u76ee\u6807\u7684OB-ADMM\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u60e9\u7f5a\u53c2\u6570\u03c1\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\uff0c\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u6700\u4f18\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fc7\u65e9\u505c\u6b62\u3002", "conclusion": "OB-ADMM\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u7f51\u7edc\u5fae\u7535\u7f51\u80fd\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u89e3\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u662f\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684ADMM\u53d8\u4f53\u3002"}}

This paper presents a novel shared control framework featuring planning-level intention prediction. A path replanning algorithm is designed to adjust the robot's desired trajectory according to inferred human intentions. To represent future motion intentions, we introduce the concept of an intention domain, which serves as a constraint for path replanning. The intention-domain prediction and path replanning problems are jointly formulated as a Markov Decision Process and solved through deep reinforcement learning. In addition, a Voronoi-based human trajectory generation algorithm is developed, allowing the model to be trained entirely in simulation without human participation or demonstration data.

Although recent advances have improved accuracy, most approaches still treat forecasting as a static one-time mapping task, lacking the interaction, reasoning, and adaptability of human experts. This gap limits their usefulness in complex real-world environments. To address this, we propose AlphaCast, a human wisdom-large language model (LLM) intelligence co-reasoning framework that redefines forecasting as an interactive process. The key idea is to enable step-by-step collaboration between human wisdom and LLM intelligence to jointly prepare, generate, and verify forecasts. The framework consists of two stages: (1) automated prediction preparation, where AlphaCast builds a multi-source cognitive foundation comprising a feature set that captures key statistics and time patterns, a domain knowledge base distilled from corpora and historical series, a contextual repository that stores rich information for each time window, and a case base that retrieves optimal strategies via pattern clustering and matching; and (2) generative reasoning and reflective optimization, where AlphaCast integrates statistical temporal features, prior knowledge, contextual information, and forecasting strategies, triggering a meta-reasoning loop for continuous self-correction and strategy refinement. Extensive experiments on short- and long-term datasets show that AlphaCast consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in predictive accuracy.

This formulation links guidance, control, and FDI by using the same cost function to drive both global task allocation and local sensing or motion decisions. Fault detection is achieved through comparisons between expected and observed task metrics, while higher-order cost-gradient measures enable the identification of faults among sensors, actuators, and state estimators.

Existing zero-shot studies have shown that incorporating memory mechanisms to support goal-directed behavior can improve long-horizon planning performance. However, they overlook visual frontier boundaries, which fundamentally dictate future trajectories and observations, and fall short of inferring the relationship between partial visual observations and navigation goals. In this paper, we propose Semantic Cognition Over Potential-based Exploration (SCOPE), a zero-shot framework that explicitly leverages frontier information to drive potential-based exploration, enabling more informed and goal-relevant decisions. SCOPE estimates exploration potential with a Vision-Language Model and organizes it into a spatio-temporal potential graph, capturing boundary dynamics to support long-horizon planning. In addition, SCOPE incorporates a self-reconsideration mechanism that revisits and refines prior decisions, enhancing reliability and reducing overconfident errors. Experimental results on two diverse embodied navigation tasks show that SCOPE outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 4.6\\% in accuracy.

We present the first Graph Neural Network (GNN) approach to approximate credulous acceptance in ABA. To leverage GNNs, we model ABA frameworks via a dependency graph representation encoding assumptions, claims and rules as nodes, with heterogeneous edge labels distinguishing support, derive and attack relations. We propose two GNN architectures - ABAGCN and ABAGAT - that stack residual heterogeneous convolution or attention layers, respectively, to learn node embeddings. Our models are trained on the ICCMA 2023 benchmark, augmented with synthetic ABAFs, with hyperparameters optimised via Bayesian search. Empirically, both ABAGCN and ABAGAT outperform a state-of-the-art GNN baseline that we adapt from the abstract argumentation literature, achieving a node-level F1 score of up to 0.71 on the ICCMA instances. Finally, we develop a sound polynomial time extension-reconstruction algorithm driven by our predictor: it reconstructs stable extensions with F1 above 0.85 on small ABAFs and maintains an F1 of about 0.58 on large frameworks.

The rapid expansion of artificial intelligence is driving unprecedented growth in data center capacity, with global electricity demand from data centers projected to double by 2026. This growth creates substantial challenges for power transmission networks, as large concentrated loads can cause congestion and threaten grid reliability. Meanwhile, the intermittent nature of solar and wind generation requires flexible resources to maintain grid reliability and minimize curtailment. This paper assesses whether data center spatial flexibility-the ability to migrate computational workloads geographically-can serve as a grid resource to address these challenges. An optimal power flow model is developed to co-optimize generation dispatch, security reserves, and flexible data center loads. Case studies on a modified IEEE 73-bus system show that inflexible data center placement can lead to severe transmission violations, with line overloads reaching 30.1%. Enabling spatial flexibility mitigates these violations in the studied scenarios and restores system feasibility. This flexibility also reduces solar curtailment by up to 61.0% by strategically reallocating load to solar-rich areas. The results suggest that spatial flexibility offers a viable approach to defer transmission upgrades and enhance renewable utilization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7535\u7f51\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5730\u7406\u8fc1\u79fb\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u8f7d\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u8f93\u7535\u62e5\u5835\u3001\u51cf\u5c11\u592a\u9633\u80fd\u5f03\u5149\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u8fdf\u8f93\u7535\u5347\u7ea7\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "motivation": "\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\u5bfc\u81f4\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7535\u529b\u9700\u6c42\u6fc0\u589e\uff0c\u7ed9\u7535\u7f51\u5e26\u6765\u62e5\u5835\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u592a\u9633\u80fd\u548c\u98ce\u80fd\u7684\u95f4\u6b47\u6027\u9700\u8981\u7075\u6d3b\u8d44\u6e90\u6765\u7ef4\u6301\u7535\u7f51\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u6700\u4f18\u6f6e\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\u53d1\u7535\u8c03\u5ea6\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u5907\u7528\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8d1f\u8f7d\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6539\u8fdb\u7684IEEE 73\u8282\u70b9\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "\u4e0d\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5e03\u5c40\u5bfc\u81f4\u8f93\u7535\u8fdd\u89c4\u4e25\u91cd\uff08\u7ebf\u8def\u8fc7\u8f7d\u8fbe30.1%\uff09\uff0c\u65f6\u7a7a\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u53ef\u6d88\u9664\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8fdd\u89c4\u5e76\u6062\u590d\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5c06\u592a\u9633\u80fd\u5f03\u5149\u51cf\u5c11\u9ad8\u8fbe61.0%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u65f6\u7a7a\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u662f\u63a8\u8fdf\u8f93\u7535\u5347\u7ea7\u548c\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u7387\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Code and data available at https://github.com/alvco/Founding_Fathers_AI", "summary": "Although Large Language Models (LLMs) show exceptional fluency, efforts persist to extract stronger reasoning capabilities from them. Drawing on search-based interpretations of LLM computation, this paper advances a systematic framework for understanding LLM reasoning and optimization. Namely, that enhancing reasoning is best achieved by structuring a multi-agent pipeline to ensure a traversal of the search space in a gradual, incremental, and sequential (GIS) manner. Stated succinctly, high-quality reasoning is a controlled, incremental search. To test this framework, we investigate the efficacy of recursive refinement (RR)--an iterative process of self-criticism, adversarial stress-testing, and integrating critical feedback--as a practical method for implementing GIS search. We designed an experiment comparing a simple, linear pipeline against a complex, explicitly structured pipeline leveraging a recursive refinement layer. The multi-agent models were constructed to reflect the historical personas of three US Founding Fathers (Hamilton, Jefferson, and Madison) using RAG-powered corpora and were prompted to generate responses to three contemporary political issues. Model performance was evaluated using a two-tiered approach: a quantitative score from an LLM arbiter agent and qualitative human judgment. Our results revealed that the complex model consistently outperformed the simple model across all nine test cases with an average arbiter-outputted score of 88.3 versus 71.7. The complex model's arguments were superior in analytical depth, structural nuance, and strategic framing. We conclude that recursive refinement is a robust architectural feature for enhancing LLM reasoning via GIS search.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u589e\u5f3aLLM\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8ba4\u4e3a\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u63a8\u7406\u662f\u53d7\u63a7\u7684\u589e\u91cf\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7ba1\u9053\u5b9e\u73b0\u9010\u6b65\u3001\u589e\u91cf\u3001\u987a\u5e8f\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u904d\u5386\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u6d41\u7545\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u4ecd\u5728\u52aa\u529b\u63d0\u53d6\u5176\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u672c\u6587\u57fa\u4e8e\u641c\u7d22\u5bfc\u5411\u7684LLM\u8ba1\u7b97\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u63a8\u8fdb\u5bf9LLM\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u9012\u5f52\u7cbe\u70bc\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0GIS\u641c\u7d22\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u7b80\u5355\u7ebf\u6027\u7ba1\u9053\u4e0e\u590d\u6742\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7ba1\u9053\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u5305\u542b\u9012\u5f52\u7cbe\u70bc\u5c42\u3002\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u53cd\u6620\u7f8e\u56fd\u5f00\u56fd\u5143\u52cb\u5386\u53f2\u4eba\u7269\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528RAG\u589e\u5f3a\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u4e09\u4e2a\u5f53\u4ee3\u653f\u6cbb\u8bae\u9898\u751f\u6210\u56de\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u590d\u6742\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6240\u6709\u4e5d\u4e2a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u7b80\u5355\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u4ef2\u88c1\u5f97\u5206\u4e3a88.3\u5bf971.7\u3002\u590d\u6742\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bba\u8bc1\u5728\u5206\u6790\u6df1\u5ea6\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u7ec6\u5fae\u5dee\u522b\u548c\u6218\u7565\u6846\u67b6\u65b9\u9762\u66f4\u4f18\u8d8a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9012\u5f52\u7cbe\u70bc\u662f\u901a\u8fc7GIS\u641c\u7d22\u589e\u5f3aLLM\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u67b6\u6784\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7ba1\u9053\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

For nonlinear systems, carefully selected sensor motion can be exploited to extract information that is otherwise unavailable, i.e. active sensing. Empirical, yet mathematically rigorous, tools are needed to (1) quantify how sensor movement can contribute to estimation performance, and (2) leverage this knowledge to improve state estimates. Here, we introduce \"BOUNDS: Bounding Observability for Uncertain Nonlinear Dynamic Systems\", and Python package pybounds, which can discover patterns of sensor motion that increase information for individual state variables. Crucially, it is suitable for partially observable nonlinear systems, accounts for sensor noise, and can be applied to either simulated or observed trajectories. We demonstrate BOUNDS through a case study on a flying agent with limited sensors, showing how active sensing can be leveraged to estimate key variables such as ground speed, altitude, and ambient wind direction. Finally, we present a framework to refine sporadic estimates from bouts of active sensing that combines data-driven state and observability estimation from artificial neural networks with model-based estimation, which we call the Augmented Information Kalman Filter (AI-KF). We validate our framework using altitude estimation given GPS-denied data from an outdoor quadcopter flight.

While recent multi-agent approaches introduce cooperation, they often focus merely on perception-level tasks, overlooking the alignment with downstream planning and control, or fall short in leveraging the full capacity of the recent emerging end-to-end autonomous driving. In this paper, we present UniMM-V2X, a novel end-to-end multi-agent framework that enables hierarchical cooperation across perception, prediction, and planning. At the core of our framework is a multi-level fusion strategy that unifies perception and prediction cooperation, allowing agents to share queries and reason cooperatively for consistent and safe decision-making. To adapt to diverse downstream tasks and further enhance the quality of multi-level fusion, we incorporate a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture to dynamically enhance the BEV representations. We further extend MoE into the decoder to better capture diverse motion patterns. Extensive experiments on the DAIR-V2X dataset demonstrate our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with a 39.7% improvement in perception accuracy, a 7.2% reduction in prediction error, and a 33.2% improvement in planning performance compared with UniV2X, showcasing the strength of our MoE-enhanced multi-level cooperative paradigm.", "AI": {"tldr": "UniMM-V2X\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5c42\u6b21\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u5b9e\u73b0\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u534f\u4f5c\uff0c\u91c7\u7528MoE\u67b6\u6784\u52a8\u6001\u589e\u5f3aBEV\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5728DAIR-V2X\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728\u611f\u77e5\u6709\u9650\u548c\u5b64\u7acb\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u65b9\u6cd5\u5927\u591a\u53ea\u5173\u6ce8\u611f\u77e5\u5c42\u9762\u534f\u4f5c\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u4e0e\u4e0b\u6e38\u89c4\u5212\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u534f\u8c03\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u5c42\u6b21\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u7edf\u4e00\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u534f\u4f5c\uff0c\u91c7\u7528MoE\u67b6\u6784\u52a8\u6001\u589e\u5f3aBEV\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06MoE\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u6355\u6349\u591a\u6837\u5316\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u5728DAIR-V2X\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u611f\u77e5\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u534739.7%\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e7.2%\uff0c\u89c4\u5212\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u534733.2%\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4UniV2X\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "MoE\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u591a\u5c42\u6b21\u534f\u4f5c\u8303\u5f0f\u5c55\u73b0\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

The models have a persistent error rate that prevents scale-up: for instance, recent experiments in the Towers of Hanoi benchmark domain showed that the process inevitably becomes derailed after at most a few hundred steps. Thus, although LLM research is often still benchmarked on tasks with relatively few dependent logical steps, there is increasing attention on the ability (or inability) of LLMs to perform long range tasks. This paper describes MAKER, the first system that successfully solves a task with over one million LLM steps with zero errors, and, in principle, scales far beyond this level. The approach relies on an extreme decomposition of a task into subtasks, each of which can be tackled by focused microagents. The high level of modularity resulting from the decomposition allows error correction to be applied at each step through an efficient multi-agent voting scheme. This combination of extreme decomposition and error correction makes scaling possible.

Although traditional search methods have been extensively applied, metaheuristic algorithms have gained popularity due to their efficiency and problem-specific heuristics.

To address these issues, this paper proposes an Enhanced Multi-Strategy Dwarf Mongoose Optimization (EDMO) algorithm, tailored for three-dimensional UAV trajectory planning in dynamic and obstacle-rich environments.

EDMO is benchmarked on 39 standard test functions from CEC2017 and CEC2020, outperforming 14 advanced algorithms in convergence speed, robustness, and optimization accuracy.

However, once deployed on public roads, ADSs are inevitably exposed to diverse driving hazards that may compromise safety and degrade system performance. This raises a strong demand for resilience of ADSs, particularly the capability to continuously monitor driving hazards and adaptively respond to potential safety violations, which is crucial for maintaining robust driving behaviors in complex driving scenarios.\n  To bridge this gap, we propose a runtime resilience-oriented framework, Argus, to mitigate the driving hazards, thus preventing potential safety violations and improving the driving performance of an ADS. Argus continuously monitors the trajectories generated by the ADS for potential hazards and, whenever the EGO vehicle is deemed unsafe, seamlessly takes control through a hazard mitigator. We integrate Argus with three state-of-the-art end-to-end ADSs, i.e., TCP, UniAD and VAD.

However, MHR design entails a comprehensive evaluation of multiple possible configurations and demands extremely time-consuming simulation of key parameters combination. To address this problem, this paper proposed a rapid prediction method of modal frequency and actual anchor radius of designed MHR using an improved Transformer-LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model for rapid design sizing. High-temperature-induced softening deformation at the anchor point reduces the actual anchor radius below the designed value. By varying key parameters such as resonator height, anchor radius and edge thickness, finite element glassblowing simulation and modal analyse were conducted to obtain the first six modal frequencies and actual anchor radius. To address regression prediction challenges with limited data, dual multi-head self-attention (MHSA) mechanisms replaced the transformer's standard Feed Forward Network, to improve hidden information capture for high-accuracy predictions of modal frequencies and anchor radius.

To overcome these limitations, we introduce Sparse Motion Field Visual Odometry (SMF-VO), a lightweight, 'motion-centric' framework. Our approach directly estimates instantaneous linear and angular velocity from sparse optical flow, bypassing the need for explicit pose estimation or expensive landmark tracking. We also employed a generalized 3D ray-based motion field formulation that works accurately with various camera models, including wide-field-of-view lenses.

This version includes minor lstlisting configuration adjustments for successful compilation. No changes to content or layout. Originally published at Euromicro DSD 2025", "summary": "Autonomous driving systems have achieved significant advances, and full autonomy within defined operational design domains near practical deployment. Expanding these domains requires addressing safety assurance under diverse conditions. Information sharing through vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication, enabled by a Dynamic Map platform built from vehicle and roadside sensor data, offers a promising solution. Real-world experiments with numerous infrastructure sensors incur high costs and regulatory challenges. Conventional single-host simulators lack the capacity for large-scale urban traffic scenarios. This paper proposes D-AWSIM, a distributed simulator that partitions its workload across multiple machines to support the simulation of extensive sensor deployment and dense traffic environments.

In this work, we present OR-R1, a data-efficient training framework for automated optimization modeling and solving. OR-R1 first employs supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to help the model acquire the essential reasoning patterns for problem formulation and code generation from limited labeled data. In addition, it improves the capability and consistency through Test-Time Group Relative Policy Optimization (TGRPO). This two-stage design enables OR-R1 to leverage both scarce labeled and abundant unlabeled data for effective learning. Experiments show that OR-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average solving accuracy of $67.7\\%$, using only $1/10$ the synthetic data required by prior methods such as ORLM, exceeding ORLM's solving accuracy by up to $4.2\\%$. Remarkably, OR-R1 outperforms ORLM by over $2.4\\%$ with just $100$ synthetic samples. Furthermore, TGRPO contributes an additional $3.1\\%-6.4\\%$ improvement in accuracy, significantly narrowing the gap between single-attempt (Pass@1) and multi-attempt (Pass@8) performance from $13\\%$ to $7\\%$.

Despite the recent advancements in motion tracking, most existing methods demand extensive tuning and rely on reference data during deployment, limiting adaptability. We present APEX (Action Priors enable Efficient Exploration), a plug-and-play extension to state-of-the-art motion tracking algorithms that eliminates any dependence on reference data during deployment, improves sample efficiency, and reduces parameter tuning effort. APEX integrates expert demonstrations directly into reinforcement learning (RL) by incorporating decaying action priors, which initially bias exploration toward expert demonstrations but gradually allow the policy to explore independently. This is combined with a multi-critic framework that balances task performance with motion style. Moreover, APEX enables a single policy to learn diverse motions and transfer reference-like styles across different terrains and velocities, while remaining robust to variations in reward design. We validate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experiments in both simulation and on a Unitree Go2 robot. By leveraging demonstrations to guide exploration during RL training, without imposing explicit bias toward them, APEX enables legged robots to learn with greater stability, efficiency, and generalization. We believe this approach paves the way for guidance-driven RL to boost natural skill acquisition in a wide array of robotic tasks, from locomotion to manipulation.

Equipping GUI agents with reliable episodic reasoning capabilities is essential for bridging the gap between users' concise task descriptions and the complexities of real-world execution. Current methods integrate Reinforcement Learning (RL) with System-2 Chain-of-Thought, yielding notable gains in reasoning enhancement. For long-horizon GUI tasks, historical interactions connect each screen to the goal-oriented episode chain, and effectively leveraging these clues is crucial for the current decision. However, existing native GUI agents exhibit weak short-term memory in their explicit reasoning, interpreting the chained interactions as discrete screen understanding, i.e., unawareness of the historical interactions within the episode. This history-agnostic reasoning challenges their performance in GUI automation. To alleviate this weakness, we propose a History-Aware Reasoning (HAR) framework, which encourages an agent to reflect on its own errors and acquire episodic reasoning knowledge from them via tailored strategies that enhance short-term memory in long-horizon interaction. The framework mainly comprises constructing a reflective learning scenario, synthesizing tailored correction guidelines, and designing a hybrid RL reward function. Using the HAR framework, we develop a native end-to-end model, HAR-GUI-3B, which alters the inherent reasoning mode from history-agnostic to history-aware, equipping the GUI agent with stable short-term memory and reliable perception of screen details. Comprehensive evaluations across a range of GUI-related benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our method.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5386\u53f2\u611f\u77e5\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6HAR\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3GUI\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5386\u53f2\u4ea4\u4e92\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5f31\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u601d\u9519\u8bef\u548c\u83b7\u53d6\u60c5\u8282\u63a8\u7406\u77e5\u8bc6\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u77ed\u671f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709GUI\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u663e\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u77ed\u671f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8f83\u5f31\uff0c\u5c06\u94fe\u5f0f\u4ea4\u4e92\u89c6\u4e3a\u79bb\u6563\u5c4f\u5e55\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5386\u53f2\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u8fd9\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86GUI\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHAR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6784\u5efa\u53cd\u601d\u5b66\u4e60\u573a\u666f\u3001\u5408\u6210\u5b9a\u5236\u6821\u6b63\u6307\u5357\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6df7\u5408RL\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6a21\u578bHAR-GUI-3B\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2aGUI\u76f8\u5173\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "HAR\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u5c06GUI\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\u4ece\u5386\u53f2\u65e0\u5173\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u5386\u53f2\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u8d4b\u4e88\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u77ed\u671f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5c4f\u5e55\u7ec6\u8282\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Owing to the open nature of its communication environment, illegitimate malicious UAVs (MUs) can infer the position of the source UAV (SU) by analyzing received signals, thus compromising the SU location privacy. To protect the SU location privacy while ensuring efficient communication with legitimate receiving UAVs (RUs), we propose an Active Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (ARIS)-assisted covert communication scheme based on virtual partitioning and artificial noise (AN). Specifically, we design a novel ARIS architecture integrated with an AN module. This architecture dynamically partitions its reflecting elements into multiple sub-regions: one subset is optimized to enhance the communication rate between the SU and RUs, while the other subset generates AN to interfere with the localization of the SU by MUs. We first derive the Cram\u00e9r-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) for the localization with received signal strength (RSS), based on which, we establish a joint optimization framework for communication enhancement and localization interference. Subsequently, we derive and validate the optimal ARIS partitioning and power allocation under average channel conditions. Finally, tailored optimization methods are proposed for the reflection precoding and AN design of the two partitions. Simulation results validate that, compared to baseline schemes, the proposed scheme significantly increases the localization error of the SU by MUs while maintaining efficient communication between the SU and RUs, thereby effectively protecting the SU location privacy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e3b\u52a8\u53ef\u91cd\u6784\u667a\u80fd\u8868\u9762(ARIS)\u7684\u9690\u853d\u901a\u4fe1\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u865a\u62df\u5206\u533a\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u566a\u58f0\u4fdd\u62a4\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u4f4d\u7f6e\u9690\u79c1\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5408\u6cd5\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5e72\u6270\u6076\u610f\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u901a\u4fe1\u73af\u5883\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u6027\uff0c\u6076\u610f\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u63a5\u6536\u4fe1\u53f7\u63a8\u65ad\u6e90\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5a01\u80c1\u4f4d\u7f6e\u9690\u79c1\u5b89\u5168\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5728\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u5408\u6cd5\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u4fdd\u62a4\u6e90\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u4f4d\u7f6e\u9690\u79c1\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b0\u578bARIS\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5c06\u53cd\u5c04\u5143\u4ef6\u52a8\u6001\u5212\u5206\u4e3a\u591a\u4e2a\u5b50\u533a\u57df\uff1a\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\u4f18\u5316SU\u4e0eRU\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u901f\u7387\uff0c\u53e6\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\u751f\u6210\u4eba\u5de5\u566a\u58f0\u5e72\u6270MU\u5bf9SU\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002\u5efa\u7acb\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u6700\u4f18\u5206\u533a\u548c\u529f\u7387\u5206\u914d\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6848\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u6076\u610f\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5bf9\u6e90\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u6e90\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u4e0e\u5408\u6cd5\u63a5\u6536\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u901a\u4fe1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6848\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u62a4\u6e90\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u4f4d\u7f6e\u9690\u79c1\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u901a\u4fe1\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5e72\u6270\u6076\u610f\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002"}}

We present a unified framework enabling independent torque and stiffness commands in real-time for diverse soft actuator types. Our unified force law captures diverse soft muscle physics in a single model with sub-ms computation, while our cascaded controller with analytical inverse dynamics maintains decoupling despite model errors and disturbances. Using co-contraction/bias coordinates, the controller independently modulates torque via bias and stiffness via co-contraction-replicating biological impedance strategies. Simulation-based validation through contact experiments demonstrates maintained independence: 200x faster settling on soft surfaces, 81% force reduction on rigid surfaces, and stable interaction vs 22-54% stability for fixed policies.

Using the differential formulation of the LPV-MPC, we demonstrate how SQP and LPV-MPC can be unified through a specific choice of scheduling variable and the 2nd Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (FTC) embedding technique and compare their convergence properties. This enables the unification of the zero-order approach of SQP with the LPV-MPC scheduling technique to enhance the computational efficiency of stochastic and robust MPC problems. To demonstrate our findings, we compare the two schemes in a simulation example.

The two most critical attributes of a dataset are the amount of information it provides and how easily this information can be learned by models. However, the multimodal nature of embodied data makes evaluating these properties particularly challenging. Prior work has largely focused on diversity, typically counting tasks and scenes or evaluating isolated modalities, which fails to provide a comprehensive picture of dataset diversity. On the other hand, the learnability of datasets has received little attention and is usually assessed post-hoc through model training, an expensive, time-consuming process that also lacks interpretability, offering little guidance on how to improve a dataset. In this work, we address both challenges by introducing two principled, data-driven tools. First, we construct a unified multimodal representation for each data sample and, based on it, propose diversity entropy, a continuous measure that characterizes the amount of information contained in a dataset. Second, we introduce the first interpretable, data-driven algorithm to efficiently quantify dataset learnability without training, enabling researchers to assess a dataset's learnability immediately upon its release. We validate our algorithm on both simulated and real-world embodied datasets, demonstrating that it yields faithful, actionable insights that enable researchers to jointly improve diversity and learnability.

However, LRMs such as DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1 often generate verbose responses containing redundant or irrelevant reasoning step-a phenomenon known as overthinking-which substantially increases computational costs. Prior efforts to mitigate this issue commonly incorporate length penalties into the reward function, but we find they frequently suffer from two critical issues: length collapse and training collapse, resulting in sub-optimal performance. To address them, we propose a pipeline for training a Conciseness Reward Model (CRM) that scores the conciseness of reasoning path. Additionally, we introduce a novel reward formulation named Conciseness Reward Function (CRF) with explicit dependency between the outcome reward and conciseness score, thereby fostering both more effective and more efficient reasoning. From a theoretical standpoint, we demonstrate the superiority of the new reward from the perspective of variance reduction and improved convergence properties. Besides, on the practical side, extensive experiments on five mathematical benchmark datasets demonstrate the method's effectiveness and token efficiency, which achieves an 8.1% accuracy improvement and a 19.9% reduction in response token length on Qwen2.5-7B.

When a sensor node depletes its energy reserves, manual intervention is often required to resume node operation. While lowering the duty cycle would help extend the network lifetime, this is often undesirable, especially in time-critical applications, where rapid collection and dissemination of information is vital. In this paper, we propose a context-aware energy management policy that helps balance the two opposing objectives of timely data collection and dissemination with energy conservation. We capture these objectives through the Value of Information (VoI) of observations made by a sensor node and the State of Energy (SoE) of the energy buffer. We formulate the energy management policy as a Model Predictive Control (MPC) problem which computes device sampling and transmission frequencies to maximize a defined utility criterion over a finite, receding, time-horizon. In the process, we also develop a unique mathematical representation for VoI, that adequately captures aspects related to continuity in monitoring, urgency of dissemination, and representation of the phenomena being observed.

However, current research predominantly relies on data-driven approaches that necessitate extensive training datasets to achieve robust multimodal decision-making capabilities and generalizable visuomotor control. These methods raise concerns due to the neglect of geometric reasoning in unseen scenarios and the inefficient modeling of robot-target relationships within the training data, resulting in significant waste of training resources. To address these limitations, we present the Recurrent Geometric-prior Multimodal Policy (RGMP), an end-to-end framework that unifies geometric-semantic skill reasoning with data-efficient visuomotor control. For perception capabilities, we propose the Geometric-prior Skill Selector, which infuses geometric inductive biases into a vision language model, producing adaptive skill sequences for unseen scenes with minimal spatial common sense tuning. To achieve data-efficient robotic motion synthesis, we introduce the Adaptive Recursive Gaussian Network, which parameterizes robot-object interactions as a compact hierarchy of Gaussian processes that recursively encode multi-scale spatial relationships, yielding dexterous, data-efficient motion synthesis even from sparse demonstrations. Evaluated on both our humanoid robot and desktop dual-arm robot, the RGMP framework achieves 87% task success in generalization tests and exhibits 5x greater data efficiency than the state-of-the-art model. This performance underscores its superior cross-domain generalization, enabled by geometric-semantic reasoning and recursive-Gaussion adaptation.", "AI": {"tldr": "RGMP\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u5148\u9a8c\u6280\u80fd\u9009\u62e9\u5668\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9012\u5f52\u9ad8\u65af\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u51e0\u4f55\u8bed\u4e49\u6280\u80fd\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8fd0\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u6cdb\u5316\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u523087%\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u9ad85\u500d\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u51b3\u7b56\u548c\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8fd0\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u4f46\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u672a\u89c1\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u673a\u5668\u4eba-\u76ee\u6807\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u9020\u6210\u8bad\u7ec3\u8d44\u6e90\u6d6a\u8d39\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRGMP\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u51e0\u4f55\u5148\u9a8c\u6280\u80fd\u9009\u62e9\u5668\uff0c\u5c06\u51e0\u4f55\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u6ce8\u5165\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u89c1\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6280\u80fd\u5e8f\u5217\uff1b2) \u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9012\u5f52\u9ad8\u65af\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5c06\u673a\u5668\u4eba-\u7269\u4f53\u4ea4\u4e92\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u4e3a\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u9012\u5f52\u7f16\u7801\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7c7b\u4eba\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u548c\u684c\u9762\u53cc\u81c2\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cRGMP\u5728\u6cdb\u5316\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u523087%\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u9ad85\u500d\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u8de8\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "RGMP\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u8bed\u4e49\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u9012\u5f52\u9ad8\u65af\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u5408\u6210\u548c\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u8de8\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6280\u80fd\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

These systems work autonomously towards a defined goal with reduced external control. Despite their potential, one of their flaws is the insufficient reliability which makes them especially unsuitable for high-risk domains such as healthcare or process industry. Unreliable systems pose a risk in terms of unexpected behavior during operation and mitigation techniques are needed. In this work, we derive the main reliability challenges of agentic AI systems during operation based on their characteristics. We draw the connection to traditional AI systems and formulate a fundamental reliability challenge during operation which is inherent to traditional and agentic AI systems. As our main contribution, we propose a two-layered reliability monitoring framework for agentic AI systems which consists of a out-of-distribution detection layer for novel inputs and AI transparency layer to reveal internal operations. This two-layered monitoring approach gives a human operator the decision support which is needed to decide whether an output is potential unreliable or not and intervene.

The dynamics of each agent's state follow a Laplacian-based update rule driven by both cooperative and antagonistic interactions in the presence of exogenous factors.

Our approach leverages upper Dini derivative analysis and Gr\u00f6nwall-type inequalities to establish exponential convergence for opinion magnitude towards the desired steady state configuration on networks with uniform quasi-strong $\u03b4$-connectivity.

However, its performance degrades in degenerate environments, such as long corridors and high-altitude flights, where LiDAR measurements are imbalanced or sparse, leading to ill-posed state estimation. In this letter, we present LODESTAR, a novel LIO method that addresses these degeneracies through two key modules: degeneracy-aware adaptive Schmidt-Kalman filter (DA-ASKF) and degeneracy-aware data exploitation (DA-DE). DA-ASKF employs a sliding window to utilize past states and measurements as additional constraints. Specifically, it introduces degeneracy-aware sliding modes that adaptively classify states as active or fixed based on their degeneracy level. Using Schmidt-Kalman update, it partially optimizes active states while preserving fixed states. These fixed states influence the update of active states via their covariances, serving as reference anchors--akin to a lodestar. Additionally, DA-DE prunes less-informative measurements from active states and selectively exploits measurements from fixed states, based on their localizability contribution and the condition number of the Jacobian matrix. Consequently, DA-ASKF enables degeneracy-aware constrained optimization and mitigates measurement sparsity, while DA-DE addresses measurement imbalance. Experimental results show that LODESTAR outperforms existing LiDAR-based odometry methods and degeneracy-aware modules in terms of accuracy and robustness under various degenerate conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "LODESTAR\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684LiDAR-\u60ef\u6027\u91cc\u7a0b\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9000\u5316\u611f\u77e5\u81ea\u9002\u5e94Schmidt-Kalman\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u548c\u9000\u5316\u611f\u77e5\u6570\u636e\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u5728\u9000\u5316\u73af\u5883\uff08\u5982\u957f\u8d70\u5eca\u3001\u9ad8\u7a7a\u98de\u884c\uff09\u4e2dLiDAR\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u6216\u7a00\u758f\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfLiDAR-\u60ef\u6027\u91cc\u7a0b\u8ba1\u5728\u9000\u5316\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3aLiDAR\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u6216\u7a00\u758f\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u9000\u5316\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6a21\u5757\uff1aDA-ASKF\uff08\u9000\u5316\u611f\u77e5\u81ea\u9002\u5e94Schmidt-Kalman\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u548c\u9000\u5316\u611f\u77e5\u6ed1\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c06\u72b6\u6001\u5206\u7c7b\u4e3a\u6d3b\u52a8\u6216\u56fa\u5b9a\uff1bDA-DE\uff08\u9000\u5316\u611f\u77e5\u6570\u636e\u5229\u7528\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c40\u90e8\u5316\u8d21\u732e\u548c\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\u77e9\u9635\u6761\u4ef6\u6570\uff0c\u4fee\u526a\u975e\u4fe1\u606f\u6027\u6d4b\u91cf\u5e76\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5229\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLODESTAR\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u9000\u5316\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8eLiDAR\u7684\u91cc\u7a0b\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u9000\u5316\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u5757\u3002", "conclusion": "LODESTAR\u901a\u8fc7\u9000\u5316\u611f\u77e5\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u6d4b\u91cf\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u7f13\u89e3\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86LiDAR-\u60ef\u6027\u91cc\u7a0b\u8ba1\u5728\u9000\u5316\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

We propose MedFuse, a framework for irregular clinical time series centered on the MuFuse (Multiplicative Embedding Fusion) module. MuFuse fuses value and feature embeddings through multiplicative modulation, preserving feature-specific information while modeling higher-order dependencies across features. Experiments on three real-world datasets covering both intensive and chronic care show that MedFuse consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on key predictive tasks. Analysis of the learned representations further demonstrates that multiplicative fusion enhances expressiveness and supports cross-dataset pretraining.

Unlike traditional approaches that rely solely on offline models, we propose a framework that incorporates real-time observations to dynamically refine probability estimates for safety and reach-avoid events. By introducing observation-aware barrier functions, our method adaptively updates probability bounds as new observations are collected, combining efficient offline computation with online backward iteration.

To address this, we introduce Humanoid-Union, a large-scale dataset generated through an autonomous pipeline, comprising over 260 hours of diverse, high-quality humanoid robot motion data with semantic annotations derived from human motion videos.

Building on this data resource, we propose SCHUR, a scalable learning framework designed to explore the impact of large-scale data on high-level control in humanoid robots. Experimental results demonstrate that SCHUR achieves high robot motion generation quality and strong text-motion alignment under data and model scaling, with 37\\% reconstruction improvement under MPJPE and 25\\% alignment improvement under FID comparing with previous methods.

To tackle these challenges, we propose HyperD (Hybrid Periodic Decoupling), a novel framework that decouples traffic data into periodic and residual components. The periodic component is handled by the Hybrid Periodic Representation Module, which extracts fine-grained daily and weekly patterns using learnable periodic embeddings and spatial-temporal attention. The residual component, which captures non-periodic, high-frequency fluctuations, is modeled by the Frequency-Aware Residual Representation Module, leveraging complex-valued MLP in frequency domain. To enforce semantic separation between the two components, we further introduce a Dual-View Alignment Loss, which aligns low-frequency information with the periodic branch and high-frequency information with the residual branch.

The findings indicate that electrical resonance is primarily pronounced in weak networks with long cables, as confirmed by the Nyquist criterion applied to frequency responses. Two real cases were successfully simulated in the time domain by introducing network changes, such as temporary faults and alterations in network's power strength, to activate the identified resonances. Notably, in a strong network with short cables, electrical resonance occurred alongside interactions between the network and the converter's protection system.

The Universal Manipulation Interface (UMI) relaxes the strict hardware requirements for data collection, but it is restricted to capturing only RGB images of a scene and omits the 3D geometric information on which many tasks rely. Inspired by DemoGen, we propose UMIGen, a unified framework that consists of two key components: (1) Cloud-UMI, a handheld data collection device that requires no visual SLAM and simultaneously records point cloud observation-action pairs; and (2) a visibility-aware optimization mechanism that extends the DemoGen pipeline to egocentric 3D observations by generating only points within the camera's field of view. These two components enable efficient data generation that aligns with real egocentric observations and can be directly transferred across different robot embodiments without any post-processing. Experiments in both simulated and real-world settings demonstrate that UMIGen supports strong cross-embodiment generalization and accelerates data collection in diverse manipulation tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "UMIGen\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u624b\u6301\u8bbe\u5907Cloud-UMI\u91c7\u96c6\u70b9\u4e91\u89c2\u6d4b-\u52a8\u4f5c\u5bf9\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u4f18\u5316\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u548c\u8de8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5177\u8eab\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b66\u4e60\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u96c6\u96be\u9898\uff1a\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6f14\u793a\u6570\u636e\u9700\u6c42\u5927\u4f46\u91c7\u96c6\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e13\u7528\u786c\u4ef6\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u3002UMI\u65b9\u6cd5\u653e\u5bbd\u4e86\u786c\u4ef6\u8981\u6c42\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f3D\u51e0\u4f55\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a(1) Cloud-UMI\u624b\u6301\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u96c6\u8bbe\u5907\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u89c6\u89c9SLAM\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8bb0\u5f55\u70b9\u4e91\u89c2\u6d4b-\u52a8\u4f5c\u5bf9\uff1b(2) \u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u4f18\u5316\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6269\u5c55DemoGen\u6d41\u7a0b\u5230\u81ea\u6211\u4e2d\u5fc33D\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u4ec5\u751f\u6210\u76f8\u673a\u89c6\u91ce\u5185\u7684\u70b9\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cUMIGen\u652f\u6301\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u8de8\u5177\u8eab\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u52a0\u901f\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u3002", "conclusion": "UMIGen\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u81ea\u6211\u4e2d\u5fc3\u89c2\u6d4b\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u53ef\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5177\u8eab\u95f4\u8fc1\u79fb\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u540e\u5904\u7406\u3002"}}

In the proposed input/state observer, each agent estimates the state and input of agents located two or more hops away using only local information exchanged with 1-hop neighbors, while guaranteeing that transient estimation errors satisfy predefined performance bounds. Conditions are established under which the input observer can be omitted, allowing the state observer convergence to be independent of the input estimates. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that if a closed-loop controller with full state knowledge achieves the control objective and the estimation-based closed-loop system is set-Input to State Stable (set-ISS) with respect to the goal set, then the estimated states can be used to achieve the system objective with an arbitrarily small worst-case error governed by the accuracy of the states estimates.

One of the promising approaches to tackle this problem is Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) -- a framework that is naturally suited to handle any robot motion model and provides strong theoretical guarantees. Still, in practice MPPI-based controller may provide suboptimal trajectories as its performance relies heavily on uninformed random sampling. In this work, we introduce CoRL-MPPI, a novel fusion of Cooperative Reinforcement Learning and MPPI to address this limitation. We train an action policy (approximated as deep neural network) in simulation that learns local cooperative collision avoidance behaviors. This learned policy is then embedded into the MPPI framework to guide its sampling distribution, biasing it towards more intelligent and cooperative actions. Notably, CoRL-MPPI preserves all the theoretical guarantees of regular MPPI. We evaluate our approach in dense, dynamic simulation environments against state-of-the-art baselines, including ORCA, BVC, and a multi-agent MPPI implementation. Our results demonstrate that CoRL-MPPI significantly improves navigation efficiency (measured by success rate and makespan) and safety, enabling agile and robust multi-robot navigation.", "AI": {"tldr": "CoRL-MPPI\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u5408\u4f5c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548cMPPI\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5b66\u4e60\u5c40\u90e8\u5408\u4f5c\u907f\u78b0\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u5d4c\u5165MPPI\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u5f15\u5bfc\u91c7\u6837\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5bfc\u822a\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5206\u6563\u5f0f\u907f\u78b0\u95ee\u9898\uff0cMPPI\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u56e0\u4f9d\u8d56\u65e0\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u968f\u673a\u91c7\u6837\u800c\u63d0\u4f9b\u6b21\u4f18\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u5176\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5408\u4f5c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff09\u5d4c\u5165MPPI\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfc\u5176\u91c7\u6837\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u5411\u66f4\u667a\u80fd\u548c\u5408\u4f5c\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5bc6\u96c6\u52a8\u6001\u4eff\u771f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4ORCA\u3001BVC\u548c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53MPPI\u7b49\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cCoRL-MPPI\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5bfc\u822a\u6548\u7387\uff08\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3001\u5b8c\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\uff09\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "CoRL-MPPI\u5728\u4fdd\u6301MPPI\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u654f\u6377\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5bfc\u822a\u3002"}}

We show a sufficient condition under which the data-driven security index coincides with the model-based security index, which implies that the exact risk level of each component can be identified solely from the data. We provide an algorithm for computing the data-driven security index. Although computing this index is NP-hard, we derive a polynomial-time computable upper bound. Numerical examples on vehicle platooning illustrate the efficacy and limitations of the proposed index and algorithms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4ec5\u4ece\u8f93\u5165/\u8f93\u51fa\u6570\u636e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5b89\u5168\u6307\u6570\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u53ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u4e0a\u754c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b89\u5168\u6307\u6570\u53ef\u4ee5\u91cf\u5316\u7ec4\u4ef6\u88ab\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u4ec5\u4ece\u6570\u636e\u5c31\u80fd\u8ba1\u7b97\u5b89\u5168\u6307\u6570\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u672a\u77e5\u7684\u573a\u666f\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6307\u6570\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6307\u6570\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u8ba1\u7b97\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u754c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8f66\u8f86\u7f16\u961f\u63a7\u5236\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u6307\u6570\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u5b89\u5168\u6307\u6570\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u672a\u77e5\u65f6\u6709\u6548\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ec4\u4ef6\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b89\u5168\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

In contrast, abundant human motion data is readily available from motion capture, videos, and virtual reality, which could help address the data scarcity problem. However, due to the embodiment gap and missing dynamic information like force and torque, these demonstrations cannot be directly executed on robots. To bridge this gap, we propose Scalable Physics-Informed DExterous Retargeting (SPIDER), a physics-based retargeting framework to transform and augment kinematic-only human demonstrations to dynamically feasible robot trajectories at scale. Our key insight is that human demonstrations should provide global task structure and objective, while large-scale physics-based sampling with curriculum-style virtual contact guidance should refine trajectories to ensure dynamical feasibility and correct contact sequences. SPIDER scales across diverse 9 humanoid/dexterous hand embodiments and 6 datasets, improving success rates by 18% compared to standard sampling, while being 10X faster than reinforcement learning (RL) baselines, and enabling the generation of a 2.4M frames dynamic-feasible robot dataset for policy learning.

Synthesizing these certificates involves discovering mathematical functions with current methods suffering from poor scalability, dependence on carefully designed templates, and exhaustive or incremental function-space searches. They also demand substantial manual expertise--selecting templates, solvers, and hyperparameters, and designing sampling strategies--requiring both theoretical and practical knowledge traditionally shared through linguistic reasoning rather than formalized methods.\n  This motivates a key question: can such expert reasoning be captured and operationalized by language models? We address this by introducing an LLM-based agentic framework for barrier certificate synthesis. The framework uses natural language reasoning to propose, refine, and validate candidate certificates, integrating LLM-driven template discovery with SMT-based verification, and supporting barrier-controller co-synthesis to ensure consistency between safety certificates and controllers.\n  To evaluate this capability, we introduce BarrierBench, a benchmark of 100 dynamical systems spanning linear, nonlinear, discrete-time, and continuous-time settings. Our experiments assess not only the effectiveness of LLM-guided barrier synthesis but also the utility of retrieval-augmented generation and agentic coordination strategies in improving its reliability and performance. Across these tasks, the framework achieves more than 90% success in generating valid certificates. By releasing BarrierBench and the accompanying toolchain, we aim to establish a community testbed for advancing the integration of language-based reasoning with formal verification in dynamical systems.\n  The benchmark is publicly available at https://hycodev.com/dataset/barrierbench", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u5c4f\u969c\u8bc1\u4e66\u5408\u6210\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u6765\u63d0\u51fa\u3001\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5019\u9009\u8bc1\u4e66\uff0c\u5728100\u4e2a\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u523090%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5c4f\u969c\u8bc1\u4e66\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5dee\u3001\u4f9d\u8d56\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6a21\u677f\u3001\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u624b\u52a8\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u63a2\u7d22\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6355\u6349\u4e13\u5bb6\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u677f\u53d1\u73b0\u548cSMT\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5c4f\u969c-\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u534f\u540c\u5408\u6210\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u5b89\u5168\u8bc1\u4e66\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7684\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728BarrierBench\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u751f\u6210\u6709\u6548\u8bc1\u4e66\u65b9\u9762\u8fbe\u523090%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6210\u529f\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u6355\u6349\u4e13\u5bb6\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f62\u5f0f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u5728\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

We provide an updated evaluation of the end-to-end planning performance of three frontier LLMs as of 2025, where models are prompted to generate a plan from PDDL domain and task descriptions. We evaluate DeepSeek R1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-5 and as reference the planner LAMA on a subset of domains from the most recent Learning Track of the International Planning Competition. Our results show that on standard PDDL domains, the performance of GPT-5 in terms of solved tasks is competitive with LAMA. When the PDDL domains and tasks are obfuscated to test for pure reasoning, the performance of all LLMs degrades, though less severely than previously reported for other models.

However, these models struggle with long-horizon tasks due to their lack of memory and reliance solely on immediate sensory inputs. To address this limitation, we propose Memory-Augmented Prompting for Vision-Language-Action model (MAP-VLA), a novel framework that empowers pre-trained VLA models with demonstration-derived memory prompts to augment action generation for long-horizon robotic manipulation tasks. To achieve this, MAP-VLA first constructs a memory library from historical demonstrations, where each memory unit captures information about a specific stage of a task. These memory units are implemented as learnable soft prompts optimized through prompt tuning. Then, during real-time task execution, MAP-VLA retrieves relevant memory through trajectory similarity matching and dynamically integrates it into the VLA model for augmented action generation. Importantly, this prompt tuning and retrieval augmentation approach operates as a plug-and-play module for a frozen VLA model, offering a lightweight and flexible solution to improve task performance. Experimental results show that MAP-VLA delivers up to 7.0% absolute performance gains in the simulation benchmark and 25.0% on real robot evaluations for long-horizon tasks, surpassing the current state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "MAP-VLA\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u589e\u5f3a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u4efb\u52a1\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u5386\u53f2\u6f14\u793a\u6784\u5efa\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5e93\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6267\u884c\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u68c0\u7d22\u76f8\u5173\u8bb0\u5fc6\u63d0\u793a\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u52a8\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3VLA\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u4eec\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5373\u65f6\u611f\u5b98\u8f93\u5165\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5386\u53f2\u6f14\u793a\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5e93\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5355\u5143\u6355\u83b7\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f68\u8ff9\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5339\u914d\u68c0\u7d22\u76f8\u5173\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u5e76\u52a8\u6001\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684VLA\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b07.0%\u7684\u7edd\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b025.0%\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "MAP-VLA\u4e3a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3VLA\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Point-based methods suffer from sparse sampling, leading to the loss of fine-grained semantics. Image-based methods typically feed RGB and depth into 2D backbones pre-trained on 3D auxiliary tasks, but their entangled semantics and geometry are sensitive to inherent depth noise in real-world that disrupts semantic understanding. Moreover, these methods focus on high-level geometry while overlooking low-level spatial cues essential for precise interaction. We propose SpatialActor, a disentangled framework for robust robotic manipulation that explicitly decouples semantics and geometry. The Semantic-guided Geometric Module adaptively fuses two complementary geometry from noisy depth and semantic-guided expert priors. Also, a Spatial Transformer leverages low-level spatial cues for accurate 2D-3D mapping and enables interaction among spatial features. We evaluate SpatialActor on multiple simulation and real-world scenarios across 50+ tasks. It achieves state-of-the-art performance with 87.4% on RLBench and improves by 13.9% to 19.4% under varying noisy conditions, showing strong robustness. Moreover, it significantly enhances few-shot generalization to new tasks and maintains robustness under various spatial perturbations.

Unlike prior benchmarks that focus on high-level description or visual question answering, CrochetBench shifts the emphasis from describing to doing: models are required to recognize stitches, select structurally appropriate instructions, and generate compilable crochet procedures. We adopt the CrochetPARADE DSL as our intermediate representation, enabling structural validation and functional evaluation via execution. The benchmark covers tasks including stitch classification, instruction grounding, and both natural language and image-to-DSL translation. Across all tasks, performance sharply declines as the evaluation shifts from surface-level similarity to executable correctness, exposing limitations in long-range symbolic reasoning and 3D-aware procedural synthesis. CrochetBench offers a new lens for assessing procedural competence in multimodal models and highlights the gap between surface-level understanding and executable precision in real-world creative domains.

However, while these models can direct a robot toward the general region of an object, they lack the geometric understanding required to precisely control dexterous robotic hands for 3D grasping. To overcome this, our key insight is to leverage simulation with a force-closure grasping generation pipeline that understands local geometries of the hand and object in the scene. Because this pipeline is slow and requires ground-truth observations, the resulting data is distilled into a diffusion model that operates in real-time on camera point clouds. By combining the global semantic understanding of internet-scale models with the geometric precision of a simulation-based locally-aware force-closure, \\our achieves high-performance semantic grasping without any manually collected training data.

We propose a complementary, architecture-agnostic approach that enhances safety through the aggregation of multiple generative models, with the aggregated model inheriting its safety from the safest subset of a given size among them. Specifically, we present a consensus sampling algorithm that, given $k$ models and a prompt, achieves risk competitive with the average risk of the safest $s$ of the $k$ models, where $s$ is a chosen parameter, while abstaining when there is insufficient agreement between them. The approach leverages the models' ability to compute output probabilities, and we bound the probability of abstention when sufficiently many models are safe and exhibit adequate agreement. The algorithm is inspired by the provable copyright protection algorithm of Vyas et al. (2023). It requires some overlap among safe models, offers no protection when all models are unsafe, and may accumulate risk over repeated use.

The aim is to create a theoretical foundation that describes the physical embodiment, sensory perception, ability to act, learning processes, and context sensitivity of intelligent systems within a coherent framework. While classical AI approaches rely on symbolic processing and data driven models, Physical AI understands intelligence as an emergent phenomenon of real interaction between body, environment, and experience. The six fundamentals presented here are embodiment, sensory perception, motor action, learning, autonomy, and context sensitivity, and form the conceptual basis for designing and evaluating physically intelligent systems. Theoretically, it is shown that these six principles do not represent loose functional modules but rather act as a closed control loop in which energy, information, control, and context are in constant interaction. This circular interaction enables a system to generate meaning not from databases, but from physical experience, a paradigm shift that understands intelligence as an physical embodied process. Physical AI understands learning not as parameter adjustment, but as a change in the structural coupling between agents and the environment. To illustrate this, the theoretical model is explained using a practical scenario: An adaptive assistant robot supports patients in a rehabilitation clinic. This example illustrates that physical intelligence does not arise from abstract calculation, but from immediate, embodied experience. It shows how the six fundamentals interact in a real system: embodiment as a prerequisite, perception as input, movement as expression, learning as adaptation, autonomy as regulation, and context as orientation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ece\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u89d2\u5ea6\u9610\u8ff0\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5305\u542b\u5177\u8eab\u5316\u3001\u611f\u5b98\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u8fd0\u52a8\u884c\u52a8\u3001\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u654f\u611f\u6027\u7684\u516d\u4e2a\u57fa\u672c\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u539f\u5219\u6784\u6210\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c01\u95ed\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u5faa\u73af\uff0c\u5c06\u667a\u80fd\u7406\u89e3\u4e3a\u8eab\u4f53\u3001\u73af\u5883\u548c\u7ecf\u9a8c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e92\u52a8\u7684\u6d8c\u73b0\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "motivation": "\u5efa\u7acb\u7269\u7406\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u63cf\u8ff0\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7269\u7406\u5177\u8eab\u5316\u3001\u611f\u5b98\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u884c\u52a8\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u5c06\u667a\u80fd\u7406\u89e3\u4e3a\u7269\u7406\u5177\u8eab\u8fc7\u7a0b\u800c\u975e\u7b26\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u516d\u4e2a\u57fa\u672c\u539f\u5219\uff08\u5177\u8eab\u5316\u3001\u611f\u5b98\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u8fd0\u52a8\u884c\u52a8\u3001\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6982\u5ff5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5eb7\u590d\u8bca\u6240\u4e2d\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8f85\u52a9\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u6765\u8bf4\u660e\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u516d\u4e2a\u539f\u5219\u5982\u4f55\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5c01\u95ed\u63a7\u5236\u5faa\u73af\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4f7f\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u7269\u7406\u7ecf\u9a8c\u800c\u975e\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7269\u7406\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5c06\u667a\u80fd\u7406\u89e3\u4e3a\u7269\u7406\u5177\u8eab\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u662f\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u4e4b\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u8026\u5408\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u8fd9\u4ee3\u8868\u4e86\u4ece\u62bd\u8c61\u8ba1\u7b97\u5230\u5177\u8eab\u4f53\u9a8c\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\u8f6c\u53d8\u3002"}}

However, the success of adversarial optimization has been largely limited to zero-sum settings because its naive application in cooperative settings leads to a critical failure mode: agents are irrationally incentivized to self-sabotage, blocking the completion of tasks and halting further learning. To address this, we introduce Rationality-preserving Policy Optimization (RPO), a formalism for adversarial optimization that avoids self-sabotage by ensuring agents remain rational--that is, their policies are optimal with respect to some possible partner policy. To solve RPO, we develop Rational Policy Gradient (RPG), which trains agents to maximize their own reward in a modified version of the original game in which we use opponent shaping techniques to optimize the adversarial objective. RPG enables us to extend a variety of existing adversarial optimization algorithms that, no longer subject to the limitations of self-sabotage, can find adversarial examples, improve robustness and adaptability, and learn diverse policies. We empirically validate that our approach achieves strong performance in several popular cooperative and general-sum environments.

In this work, we theoretically and empirically compare two popular methods for escaping UHRs in breadth-first search (BrFS) and restarting random walks (RRWs). We first derive the expected runtime of escaping a UHR using BrFS and RRWs, based on properties of the UHR and the random walk procedure, and then use these results to identify when RRWs will be faster in expectation than BrFS. We then evaluate these methods for escaping UHRs by comparing standard EHC, which uses BrFS to escape UHRs, to variants of EHC called EHC-RRW, which use RRWs for that purpose. EHC-RRW is shown to have strong expected runtime guarantees in cases where EHC has previously been shown to be effective. We also run experiments with these approaches on PDDL planning benchmarks to better understand their relative effectiveness for escaping UHRs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u5e7f\u5ea6\u4f18\u5148\u641c\u7d22(BrFS)\u548c\u91cd\u542f\u968f\u673a\u6e38\u8d70(RRW)\u4e24\u79cd\u9003\u79bb\u65e0\u4fe1\u606f\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u533a\u57df(UHR)\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u671f\u671b\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528RRW\u7684EHC-RRW\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u5728PDDL\u89c4\u5212\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u8d2a\u5a6a\u641c\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982GBFS\u548cEHC\u5728\u9047\u5230\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u5c40\u90e8\u6781\u5c0f\u503c\u6216\u5e73\u53f0\u7b49\u65e0\u4fe1\u606f\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u533a\u57df(UHR)\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9003\u79bb\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u7406\u8bba\u63a8\u5bfcBrFS\u548cRRW\u9003\u79bbUHR\u7684\u671f\u671b\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1EHC-RRW\u53d8\u4f53\u4f7f\u7528RRW\u66ff\u4ee3BrFS\uff0c\u5e76\u5728PDDL\u89c4\u5212\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86RRW\u6bd4BrFS\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\uff0cEHC-RRW\u5728EHC\u6709\u6548\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u671f\u671b\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86RRW\u5728\u9003\u79bbUHR\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91cd\u542f\u968f\u673a\u6e38\u8d70(RRW)\u662f\u9003\u79bb\u65e0\u4fe1\u606f\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u533a\u57df\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cEHC-RRW\u53d8\u4f53\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u90fd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}
