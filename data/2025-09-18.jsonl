To address this, we introduce a framework\nthat confronts higher-order network theory with empirical evidence from a\nlarge-scale, real-world multimodal transport network. Our findings confirm a\nfundamental duality: network integration enhances static robustness metrics but\nsimultaneously creates the structural pathways for catastrophic cascades.\nCrucially, we uncover the source of this paradox: a profound disconnect between\nstatic network structure and dynamic functional failure. We provide strong\nevidence that metrics derived from the network's static blueprint-encompassing\nboth conventional low-order centrality and novel higher-order structural\nanalyses-are fundamentally disconnected from and thus poor predictors of a\nsystem's dynamic functional resilience. This result highlights the inherent\nlimitations of static analysis and underscores the need for a paradigm shift\ntowards dynamic models to design and manage truly resilient urban systems."}

Customers\ninteract sequentially with the menu following a cascade click model, and their\npurchase decisions are influenced by price sensitivity and positions of various\nitems in the menu. We model the seller-platform interaction as a Stackelberg\ngame with sellers as leaders and consider two different games depending on\nwhether the prices are set by the platform or prefixed by the sellers. It is\ncomplicated to find the optimal policy of the platform in complete generality;\nhence, we solve the problem in an important asymptotic regime.\n  The core contribution of this paper lies in characterizing the equilibrium\nstructure of the limit game. We show that when sellers are of different\nstrengths, the standard Nash equilibrium does not exist due to discontinuities\nin utilities. We instead establish the existence of a novel equilibrium\nsolution, namely `$\\mu$-connected equilibrium cycle' ($\\mu$-EC), which captures\noscillatory strategic responses at the equilibrium. Unlike the (pure) Nash\nequilibrium, which defines a fixed point of mutual best responses, this is a\nset-valued solution concept of connected components. This novel equilibrium\nconcept identifies a Cartesian product set of connected action profiles in the\ncontinuous action space that satisfies four important properties: stability\nagainst external deviations, no external chains, instability against internal\ndeviations, and minimality. We extend a recently introduced solution concept\nequilibrium cycle to include stability against measure-zero violations and, by\navoiding topological difficulties to propose $\\mu$-EC."}

The current transport is explained by a\ntrap-to-trap tunneling process, and the resistive switching by a modulation of\nthe defect density within the sub-band of the TaOx that behaves as electric\nfield and temperature confinement layer. The local temperature and electric\nfield distributions are derived from the solution of the electric and heat\ntransport equations in a 3D finite element ReRAM model.

In this work, we present a systematic\ncomparison of \"thinking\" and \"non-thinking\" LLMs in the LLM-as-a-judge paradigm\nusing open-source Qwen 3 models of relatively small sizes (0.6B, 1.7B, and 4B\nparameters). We evaluate both accuracy and computational efficiency (FLOPs) on\nRewardBench tasks, and further examine augmentation strategies for non-thinking\nmodels, including in-context learning, rubric-guided judging, reference-based\nevaluation, and n-best aggregation. Our results show that despite these\nenhancements, non-thinking models generally fall short of their thinking\ncounterparts. Our results show that thinking models achieve approximately 10%\npoints higher accuracy with little overhead (under 2x), in contrast to\naugmentation strategies like few-shot learning, which deliver modest gains at a\nhigher cost (>8x). Bias and robustness analyses further demonstrate that\nthinking models maintain significantly greater consistency under a variety of\nbias conditions such as positional, bandwagon, identity, diversity, and random\nbiases (6% higher on average). We further extend our experiments to the\nmultilingual setting and our results confirm that explicit reasoning extends\nits benefits beyond English.

Hallucinations, the\ngeneration of fabricated, misleading, oversimplified or untrustworthy outputs,\nhas emerged as imperative challenges. While regulatory, academic, and technical\ndiscourse position accuracy as the principal benchmark for mitigating such\nharms, this article contends that overreliance on accuracy misdiagnoses the\nproblem and has counterproductive effect: the accuracy paradox. Drawing on\ninterdisciplinary literatures, this article develops a taxonomy of\nhallucination types and shows the paradox along three intertwining dimensions:\noutputs, individuals and society. First, accuracy functions as a superficial\nproxy for reliability, incentivising the optimisation of rhetorical fluency and\nsurface-level correctness over epistemic trustworthiness. This encourages\npassive user trust in outputs that appear accurate but epistemically untenable.\nSecond, accuracy as a singular metric fails to detect harms that are not\nfactually false but are nonetheless misleading, value-laden, or socially\ndistorting, including consensus illusions, sycophantic alignment, and subtle\nmanipulation. Third, regulatory overemphasis on accuracy obscures the wider\nsocietal consequences of hallucination, including social sorting, privacy\nviolations, equity harms, epistemic convergence that marginalises dissent,\nreduces pluralism, and causes social deskilling. By examining the EU AI Act,\nGDPR, and DSA, the article argues that current regulations are not yet\nstructurally equipped to address these epistemic, relational, and systemic\nharms and exacerbated by the overreliance on accuracy. By exposing such\nconceptual and practical challenges, this article calls for a fundamental shift\ntowards pluralistic, context-aware, and manipulation-resilient approaches to AI\ntrustworthy governance."}

Synthetic data mimic real-world\nobservations, but do not refer to external features. This lack of a\nrepresentational relationship, however, not prevent researchers from using\nsynthetic data as training data for AI models and ground truth repositories. It\nis claimed that the lack of data realism is not merely an acceptable tradeoff,\nbut often leads to better model performance than realistic data: compensate for\nknown biases, prevent overfitting and support generalization, and make the\nmodels more robust in dealing with unexpected outliers. Indeed, injecting noisy\nand outright implausible data into training sets can be beneficial for the\nmodel. This greatly complicates usual assumptions based on which\nrepresentational accuracy determines data fidelity (garbage in - garbage out).\nFurthermore, ground truth becomes a self-referential affair, in which the\nlabels used as a ground truth repository are themselves synthetic products of a\ngenerative model and as such not connected to real-world observations.

Recent advances allow robotic interventions with lesser risk.\nThe combination of robot interventions with scene understanding and mapping\nalso opens up the possibilities for automation. We present a novel pipeline\nthat enables real-time, semantically informed 3D reconstructions of the central\nairway using monocular endoscopic video.\n  Our approach combines DROID-SLAM with a segmentation model trained to\nidentify obstructive tissues. The SLAM module reconstructs the 3D geometry of\nthe airway in real time, while the segmentation masks guide the annotation of\nobstruction regions within the reconstructed point cloud. To validate our\npipeline, we evaluate the reconstruction quality using ex vivo models.\n  Qualitative and quantitative results show high similarity between ground\ntruth CT scans and the 3D reconstructions (0.62 mm Chamfer distance). By\nintegrating segmentation directly into the SLAM workflow, our system produces\nannotated 3D maps that highlight clinically relevant regions in real time.\nHigh-speed capabilities of the pipeline allows quicker reconstructions compared\nto previous work, reflecting the surgical scene more accurately.\n  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to integrate semantic\nsegmentation with real-time monocular SLAM for endoscopic CAO scenarios. Our\nframework is modular and can generalize to other anatomies or procedures with\nminimal changes, offering a promising step toward autonomous robotic\ninterventions."}

This paper introduces $Agent^2$, a novel\nagent-generates-agent framework that achieves fully automated RL agent design\nthrough intelligent LLM-driven generation. The system autonomously transforms\nnatural language task descriptions and environment code into comprehensive,\nhigh-performance reinforcement learning solutions without human intervention.\n$Agent^2$ features a revolutionary dual-agent architecture. The Generator Agent\nserves as an autonomous AI designer that analyzes tasks and generates\nexecutable RL agents, while the Target Agent is the resulting automatically\ngenerated RL agent. The framework decomposes RL development into two distinct\nstages: MDP modeling and algorithmic optimization, enabling more targeted and\neffective agent generation. Built on the Model Context Protocol, $Agent^2$\nprovides a unified framework that standardizes intelligent agent creation\nacross diverse environments and algorithms, while incorporating adaptive\ntraining management and intelligent feedback analysis for continuous\nimprovement. Extensive experiments on a wide range of benchmarks, including\nMuJoCo, MetaDrive, MPE, and SMAC, demonstrate that $Agent^2$ consistently\noutperforms manually designed solutions across all tasks, achieving up to 55%\nperformance improvement and substantial gains on average.

Hallucinations, the\ngeneration of fabricated, misleading, oversimplified or untrustworthy outputs,\nhas emerged as imperative challenges. While regulatory, academic, and technical\ndiscourse position accuracy as the principal benchmark for mitigating such\nharms, this article contends that overreliance on accuracy misdiagnoses the\nproblem and has counterproductive effect: the accuracy paradox. Drawing on\ninterdisciplinary literatures, this article develops a taxonomy of\nhallucination types and shows the paradox along three intertwining dimensions:\noutputs, individuals and society. First, accuracy functions as a superficial\nproxy for reliability, incentivising the optimisation of rhetorical fluency and\nsurface-level correctness over epistemic trustworthiness. This encourages\npassive user trust in outputs that appear accurate but epistemically untenable.\nSecond, accuracy as a singular metric fails to detect harms that are not\nfactually false but are nonetheless misleading, value-laden, or socially\ndistorting, including consensus illusions, sycophantic alignment, and subtle\nmanipulation. Third, regulatory overemphasis on accuracy obscures the wider\nsocietal consequences of hallucination, including social sorting, privacy\nviolations, equity harms, epistemic convergence that marginalises dissent,\nreduces pluralism, and causes social deskilling. By examining the EU AI Act,\nGDPR, and DSA, the article argues that current regulations are not yet\nstructurally equipped to address these epistemic, relational, and systemic\nharms and exacerbated by the overreliance on accuracy. By exposing such\nconceptual and practical challenges, this article calls for a fundamental shift\ntowards pluralistic, context-aware, and manipulation-resilient approaches to AI\ntrustworthy governance."}

We collect a dataset of safety-relevant primary\nand secondary behaviors to evaluate steering effectiveness and behavioral\nentanglement centered around five popular steering methods.

Our results on Qwen-2.5-7B and\nLlama-3.1-8B find that strong steering performance is dependent on the specific\ncombination of steering method, model, and targeted behavior, and that severe\nconcept entanglement can result from poor combinations of these three as well.\nWe release our code here:\nhttps://github.com/wang-research-lab/SteeringControl.git."}

This greatly complicates usual assumptions based on which\nrepresentational accuracy determines data fidelity (garbage in - garbage out).\nFurthermore, ground truth becomes a self-referential affair, in which the\nlabels used as a ground truth repository are themselves synthetic products of a\ngenerative model and as such not connected to real-world observations. My paper\nexamines how ML researchers and practitioners bootstrap ground truth under such\nparadoxical circumstances without relying on the stable ground of\nrepresentation and real-world reference. It will also reflect on the broader\nimplications of a shift from a representational to what could be described as a\nmimetic or iconic concept of data."}

Offline RL mitigates\nthese issues but remains susceptible to unstable training and heavily rely on\nexpert-quality datasets. To address these challenges, we formulate a joint UAV\ntrajectory planning and resource allocation problem to maximize energy\nefficiency of data collection. The resource allocation subproblem is first\ntransformed into an equivalent linear programming formulation and solved\noptimally with polynomial-time complexity. Then, we propose a large language\nmodel (LLM)-empowered critic-regularized decision transformer (DT) framework,\ntermed LLM-CRDT, to learn effective UAV control policies. In LLM-CRDT, we\nincorporate critic networks to regularize the DT model training, thereby\nintegrating the sequence modeling capabilities of DT with critic-based value\nguidance to enable learning effective policies from suboptimal datasets.\nFurthermore, to mitigate the data-hungry nature of transformer models, we\nemploy a pre-trained LLM as the transformer backbone of the DT model and adopt\na parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy, i.e., LoRA, enabling rapid\nadaptation to UAV control tasks with small-scale dataset and low computational\noverhead.

Our analysis shows that students primarily use prompting\nto generate initial solutions, and then often enter short edit-run loops to\nrefine their code following a failed execution.

This\nstudy investigates whether traditional closed-book mathematics examinations\nretain their pedagogical relevance when hypothetically administered in\nuninvigilated, open-book settings with GenAI access. Adopting an empirical\napproach, we generate, transcribe, and blind-mark GenAI submissions to eight\nundergraduate mathematics examinations at a Russel Group university, spanning\nthe entirety of the first-year curriculum. By combining independent GenAI\nresponses to individual questions, we enable a meaningful evaluation of GenAI\nperformance, both at the level of modules and across the first-year curriculum.\nWe find that GenAI attainment is at the level of a first-class degree, though\ncurrent performance can vary between modules. Further, we find that GenAI\nperformance is remarkably consistent when viewed across the entire curriculum,\nsignificantly more so than that of students in invigilated examinations. Our\nfindings evidence the need for redesigning assessments in mathematics for\nunsupervised settings, and highlight the potential reduction in pedagogical\nvalue of current standards in the era of generative artificial intelligence."}

Any2Track\nreformulates dynamics adaptability as an additional capability on top of basic\naction execution and consists of two key components: AnyTracker and AnyAdapter.\nAnyTracker is a general motion tracker with a series of careful designs to\ntrack various motions within a single policy. AnyAdapter is a history-informed\nadaptation module that endows the tracker with online dynamics adaptability to\novercome the sim2real gap and multiple real-world disturbances. We deploy\nAny2Track on Unitree G1 hardware and achieve a successful sim2real transfer in\na zero-shot manner. Any2Track performs exceptionally well in tracking various\nmotions under multiple real-world disturbances."}

We use this to suggest a more precise definition of\nthe term. Methods: We analyse 172 value alignment research articles that have\nbeen published in recent years and synthesise their content using thematic\nanalyses. Results: Our analysis leads to six themes: value alignment drivers &\napproaches; challenges in value alignment; values in value alignment; cognitive\nprocesses in humans and AI; human-agent teaming; and designing and developing\nvalue-aligned systems. Conclusions: By analysing these themes in the context of\nthe literature we define value alignment as an ongoing process between humans\nand autonomous agents that aims to express and implement abstract values in\ndiverse contexts, while managing the cognitive limits of both humans and AI\nagents and also balancing the conflicting ethical and political demands\ngenerated by the values in different groups.

These prompts are then consumed by $\\pi_0$,\na flow-based VLA policy, which integrates the prompts with multi-view camera\nobservations to produce continuous robot actions. This design enables CLAW to\ncombine symbolic weight reasoning with high-frequency visuomotor control. We\nvalidate CLAW on three experimental setups: single-object grasping and\nmixed-object tasks requiring dual-arm manipulation. Across all conditions, CLAW\nreliably executes weight-aware behaviors and outperforms both raw-$\\pi_0$ and\nfine-tuned $\\pi_0$ models. We have uploaded the videos as supplementary\nmaterials."}

We found that conventional\napproaches that specify agent behaviors through implicit natural language\ndescriptions cannot yield consistent behaviors across models, and the produced\nagent behaviors do not capture the nuances of the descriptions. In contrast,\nCoBRA presents a new approach to program agents' cognitive biases explicitly,\nby grounding agents' expected behaviors using classic social science\nexperiments. CoBRA has two components: (1) Cognitive Bias Index that measures\nthe cognitive bias of a social agent, by quantifying the agent's reactions in a\nset of validated classical social science experiments; (2) Behavioral\nRegulation Engine that aligns the agent's behavior to demonstrate controlled\ncognitive bias. We evaluated CoBRA as an HCI toolkit through demonstration and\ntechnical benchmarks.

At the same time, the existing transmission grid is\noften already congested, and urgently needed reinforcements are frequently\ndelayed due to several constraints. To address these challenges, adjusting the\ngrid topology based on congestion patterns is considered a non-costly remedy to\nguarantee efficient power transmission. Based on this idea, this paper proposes\na grid topology optimization model combining optimal transmission switching and\nbusbar splitting for AC and hybrid AC/DC grids. The methodology incorporates\nRES forecast uncertainty through a scenario-based stochastic optimization\napproach, using real offshore wind data and K-means clustering to generate\nrepresentative forecast error scenarios. The proposed model includes several\nformulations to be compared with a plain optimal power flow (OPF) model: hourly\noptimizing the topology, one topology for 24 hours, or a limited number of\nswitching actions over a day. The grid topology optimization model is\nformulated as a Mixed-Integer Quadratic Convex Problem, optimized based on the\nday-ahead (D-1) RES forecast and validated for AC-feasibility via an AC-OPF\nformulation. Based on the generation setpoints of the feasibility check, a\nredispatch simulation based on the measured (D) RES realization is then\ncomputed. The methodology is tested on an AC 30-bus test case and a hybrid\nAC/DC 50-bus test case, for a 24-hours (30-bus) and a 14-days (both test cases)\ntime series. The results highlight the economic benefits brought by grid\ntopology optimization for congested test cases with high penetration of RES. In\naddition, the results demonstrate that accounting for RES uncertainty with at\nleast 6 to 8 scenarios leads to lower or comparable total costs to\ndeterministic day-ahead forecasts, even when limiting the frequency of\ntopological actions."}

In this\nwork, we propose CLAW (CLIP-Language-Action for Weight), a framework that\ndecouples condition evaluation from action generation. CLAW leverages a\nfine-tuned CLIP model as a lightweight prompt generator, which continuously\nmonitors the digital readout of a scale and produces discrete directives based\non task-specific weight thresholds. These prompts are then consumed by $\\pi_0$,\na flow-based VLA policy, which integrates the prompts with multi-view camera\nobservations to produce continuous robot actions. This design enables CLAW to\ncombine symbolic weight reasoning with high-frequency visuomotor control. We\nvalidate CLAW on three experimental setups: single-object grasping and\nmixed-object tasks requiring dual-arm manipulation. Across all conditions, CLAW\nreliably executes weight-aware behaviors and outperforms both raw-$\\pi_0$ and\nfine-tuned $\\pi_0$ models. We have uploaded the videos as supplementary\nmaterials."}

We propose to learn such behaviors from expert\ndemonstrations via imitation learning (IL). However, when expert demonstrations\nare multi-modal, standard IL approaches can struggle to capture the diverse\nstrategies, hindering effective coordination. Diffusion models are known to be\neffective at handling complex multi-modal trajectory distributions in\nsingle-agent systems. Diffusion models have also excelled in multi-agent\nscenarios where multi-modality is more common and crucial to learning\ncoordinated behaviors. Typically, diffusion-based approaches require a\ncentralized planner or explicit communication among agents, but this assumption\ncan fail in real-world scenarios where robots must operate independently or\nwith agents like humans that they cannot directly communicate with. Therefore,\nwe propose MIMIC-D, a Centralized Training, Decentralized Execution (CTDE)\nparadigm for multi-modal multi-agent imitation learning using diffusion\npolicies. Agents are trained jointly with full information, but execute\npolicies using only local information to achieve implicit coordination.

Empirical studies\ndocument serious shortcomings: long publication delays, escalating reviewer\nburden concentrated on a small minority of scholars, inconsistent quality and\nlow inter-reviewer agreement, and systematic biases by gender, language, and\ninstitutional prestige. Decades of human-centered reforms have yielded only\nmarginal improvements. Meanwhile, artificial intelligence, especially large\nlanguage models (LLMs), is being piloted across the peer-review pipeline by\njournals, funders, and individual reviewers. Early studies suggest that AI\nassistance can produce reviews comparable in quality to humans, accelerate\nreviewer selection and feedback, and reduce certain biases, but also raise\ndistinctive concerns about hallucination, confidentiality, gaming, novelty\nrecognition, and loss of trust. In this paper, we map the aims and persistent\nfailure modes of peer review to specific LLM applications and systematically\nanalyze the objections they raise alongside safeguards that could make their\nuse acceptable. Drawing on emerging evidence, we show that targeted, supervised\nLLM assistance can plausibly improve error detection, timeliness, and reviewer\nworkload without displacing human judgment. We highlight advanced\narchitectures, including fine-tuned, retrieval-augmented, and multi-agent\nsystems, that may enable more reliable, auditable, and interdisciplinary\nreview. We argue that ethical and practical considerations are not peripheral\nbut constitutive: the legitimacy of AI-assisted peer review depends on\ngovernance choices as much as technical capacity.
