We develop\na stylized, spatially explicit global model that links exogenous food-demand\ntrajectories to crop and livestock production, land conversion, and feedbacks\nfrom ecosystem integrity that, in turn, shape future yields and land needs.\nCalibrated to post-1960 trends in population, income, yields, input use, and\nland use, the model reproduces the joint rise of crop and meat demand and the\nassociated expansion and intensification of agriculture. We use it to compare\nbusiness-as-usual, supply-side, demand-side, and mixed-policy scenarios. Three\nresults stand out. First, productivity-oriented supply-side measures (e.g.\nreduced chemical inputs, organic conversion, lower livestock density) often\ntrigger compensatory land expansion that undermines ecological gains-so that\nsupply-side action alone cannot halt deforestation or widespread degradation.\nSecond, demand-side change, particularly reduced meat consumption, consistently\nrelieves both intensification and expansion pressures; in our simulations, only\nsubstantial demand reductions (on the order of 40% of projected excess demand\nby 2100) deliver simultaneous increases in forest area and declines in degraded\nland. Third, integrated policy portfolios that jointly constrain land\nconversion, temper input intensification, and curb demand outperform any single\nlever. Together, these findings clarify the system-level trade-offs that\nfrustrate piecemeal interventions and identify the policy combinations most\nlikely to keep global food provision within ecological limits."}

Our results validate key\ntheoretical predictions: crowdfunding mechanisms induce distinct strategic\nbehaviors compared to voting, where participants are more likely to follow\nprivate signals (odds ratio: 0.139, $p < 0.001$). Additionally, the study\ndemonstrates that higher signal accuracy (85\\% vs. 55\\%) decreases risk\naversion (odds ratio: 0.414, $p = 0.024$) but increases reliance on mutual\ninsurance (odds ratio: 2.532, $p = 0.026$).

In restricted\nand complex environments, high-precision maneuvers are required to achieve a\nhigh success rate in planning, yet existing approaches often rely on explicit\naction modeling, which faces challenges when accurately modeling the optimal\naction distribution. In this paper, we propose DRIP, a diffusion-refined\nplanner anchored in reinforcement learning (RL) prior action distribution, in\nwhich an RL-pretrained policy provides prior action distributions to regularize\nthe diffusion training process.

We use differential\nevolution to generate geometric patrol routes that localize unknown signals\nindependently of emitter parameters, a key challenge in electromagnetic\nsurveillance. Patrol shape and antenna type are shown to influence information\ngain, which in turn determines the effective triangulation coverage. We\nsimulate a four-robot swarm across eight configurations, assigning\npre-generated patrol routes based on a specified patrol shape and sensing\ncapability (antenna type: omnidirectional or directional). An emitter is placed\nwithin the map for each trial, with randomized position, transmission power and\nfrequency. Results show that omnidirectional localization success rates are\ndriven primarily by source location rather than signal properties, with\nfailures occurring most often when sources are placed in peripheral areas of\nthe map. Directional antennas are able to overcome this limitation due to their\nhigher gain and directivity, with an average detection success rate of 98.75%\ncompared to 80.25% for omnidirectional. Average localization errors range from\n1.01-1.30 m for directional sensing and 1.67-1.90 m for omnidirectional\nsensing; while directional sensing also benefits from shorter patrol edges.\nThese results demonstrate that a swarm's ability to predict electromagnetic\nphenomena is directly dependent on its physical interaction with the\nenvironment. Consequently, spatial intelligence, realized here through\noptimized patrol routes and antenna selection, is a critical design\nconsideration for effective robotic surveillance."}

In restricted\nand complex environments, high-precision maneuvers are required to achieve a\nhigh success rate in planning, yet existing approaches often rely on explicit\naction modeling, which faces challenges when accurately modeling the optimal\naction distribution. In this paper, we propose DRIP, a diffusion-refined\nplanner anchored in reinforcement learning (RL) prior action distribution, in\nwhich an RL-pretrained policy provides prior action distributions to regularize\nthe diffusion training process. During the inference phase the denoising\nprocess refines these coarse priors into more precise action distributions. By\nsteering the denoising trajectory through the reinforcement learning prior\ndistribution during training, the diffusion model inherits a well-informed\ninitialization, resulting in more accurate action modeling, a higher planning\nsuccess rate, and reduced inference steps. We evaluate our approach across\nparking scenarios with varying degrees of spatial constraints.

We use differential\nevolution to generate geometric patrol routes that localize unknown signals\nindependently of emitter parameters, a key challenge in electromagnetic\nsurveillance. Patrol shape and antenna type are shown to influence information\ngain, which in turn determines the effective triangulation coverage. We\nsimulate a four-robot swarm across eight configurations, assigning\npre-generated patrol routes based on a specified patrol shape and sensing\ncapability (antenna type: omnidirectional or directional). An emitter is placed\nwithin the map for each trial, with randomized position, transmission power and\nfrequency. Results show that omnidirectional localization success rates are\ndriven primarily by source location rather than signal properties, with\nfailures occurring most often when sources are placed in peripheral areas of\nthe map. Directional antennas are able to overcome this limitation due to their\nhigher gain and directivity, with an average detection success rate of 98.75%\ncompared to 80.25% for omnidirectional. Average localization errors range from\n1.01-1.30 m for directional sensing and 1.67-1.90 m for omnidirectional\nsensing; while directional sensing also benefits from shorter patrol edges.\nThese results demonstrate that a swarm's ability to predict electromagnetic\nphenomena is directly dependent on its physical interaction with the\nenvironment.

The safety, security, and functionality of these systems are critical,\nespecially in high-stakes applications. However, the current ecosystem of\ninter-agent communication is fragmented, with protocols such as the Model\nContext Protocol (MCP) for tool access and the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol\nfor coordination being analyzed in isolation. This fragmentation creates a\nsemantic gap that prevents the rigorous analysis of system properties and\nintroduces risks such as architectural misalignment and exploitable\ncoordination issues. To address these challenges, we introduce a modeling\nframework for agentic AI systems composed of two foundational models. The\nfirst, the host agent model, formalizes the top-level entity that interacts\nwith the user, decomposes tasks, and orchestrates their execution by leveraging\nexternal agents and tools. The second, the task lifecycle model, details the\nstates and transitions of individual sub-tasks from creation to completion,\nproviding a fine-grained view of task management and error handling. Together,\nthese models provide a unified semantic framework for reasoning about the\nbehavior of multi-AI agent systems. Grounded in this framework, we define 17\nproperties for the host agent and 14 for the task lifecycle, categorized into\nliveness, safety, completeness, and fairness. Expressed in temporal logic,\nthese properties enable formal verification of system behavior, detection of\ncoordination edge cases, and prevention of deadlocks and security\nvulnerabilities.

(2) Real-time control requires carefully balancing\nmodel capacity with computational efficiency. To address these challenges, We\npropose AdaMoE, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture that inherits\npretrained weights from dense VLA models, and scales up the action expert by\nsubstituting the feedforward layers into sparsely activated MoE layers. AdaMoE\nemploys a decoupling technique that decouples expert selection from expert\nweighting through an independent scale adapter working alongside the\ntraditional router. This enables experts to be selected based on task relevance\nwhile contributing with independently controlled weights, allowing\ncollaborative expert utilization rather than winner-takes-all dynamics.

Addressing the challenges\nfaced in designing active transtibial prostheses, such as maintaining energetic\nautonomy and minimizing weight, is vital for the study. With this aim, we try\nto imitate the human ankle by providing extensive push-off assistance to\nachieve a natural-like torque profile. Thus, Energy Store and Extended Release\nmechanism (ESER) is employed with a novel Extra Energy Storage (EES) mechanism.\nKinematic and kinetic analyses are carried out to determine the design\nparameters and assess the design performance. Subsequently, a Computer-Aided\nDesign (CAD) model is built and used in comprehensive dynamic and structural\nanalyses. These analyses are used for the design performance evaluation and\ndetermine the forces and torques applied to the prosthesis, which aids in\noptimizing the design for minimal weight via structural analysis and topology\noptimization. The design of the prototype is then finalized and manufactured\nfor experimental evaluation to validate the design and functionality.

However, widely used\nadditive, fixed-noise models are not representative of complex sensor\nmodalities with state-dependent error characteristics. Although CBFs have been\ndesigned to mitigate uncertainty using fixed worst-case bounds on measurement\nnoise, this approach can lead to overly-conservative control. To solve this\nproblem, we extend the Belief Control Barrier Function (BCBF) framework to\naccommodate state-dependent measurement noise via the Generalized Extended\nKalman Filter (GEKF) algorithm, which models measurement noise as a linear\nfunction of the state. Using the original BCBF framework as baseline, we\ndemonstrate the performance of the BCBF-GEKF approach through simulation\nresults on a 1D single integrator setpoint tracking scenario and 2D unicycle\nkinematics trajectory tracking scenario. Our results confirm that the BCBF-GEKF\napproach offers less conservative control with greater safety."}

However, most of\nthe current approaches train their model for a single environment, limiting\ntheir generalization to environments not seen during training. The techniques\nthat do train a model for multiple environments rely on a specific camera to\nprovide the model with the necessary environmental information and therefore\nalways require that sensor. To effectively adapt to diverse scenarios without\nthe need for retraining, this research proposes Context-Aware Motion Planning\nDiffusion (CAMPD). CAMPD leverages a classifier-free denoising probabilistic\ndiffusion model, conditioned on sensor-agnostic contextual information. An\nattention mechanism, integrated in the well-known U-Net architecture,\nconditions the model on an arbitrary number of contextual parameters. CAMPD is\nevaluated on a 7-DoF robot manipulator and benchmarked against state-of-the-art\napproaches on real-world tasks, showing its ability to generalize to unseen\nenvironments and generate high-quality, multi-modal trajectories, at a fraction\nof the time required by existing methods."}

To address this challenge, we propose GuardSpace, a guardrail framework\nfor preserving safety alignment throughout fine-tuning, composed of two key\ncomponents: a safety-sensitive subspace and a harmful-resistant null space.\nFirst, we explicitly decompose pre-trained weights into safety-relevant and\nsafety-irrelevant components using covariance-preconditioned singular value\ndecomposition, and initialize low-rank adapters from the safety-irrelevant\nones, while freezing safety-relevant components to preserve their associated\nsafety mechanism. Second, we construct a null space projector that restricts\nadapter updates from altering safe outputs on harmful prompts, thereby\nmaintaining the original refusal behavior.

This design alleviates the path explosion issue encountered by\nGroup Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) in long-horizon tasks and enables\nstable, critic-free joint training. Hi-Agent achieves a new State-Of-The-Art\n(SOTA) 87.9% task success rate on the Android-in-the-Wild (AitW) benchmark,\nsignificantly outperforming prior methods across three paradigms: prompt-based\n(AppAgent: 17.7%), supervised (Filtered BC: 54.5%), and reinforcement\nlearning-based (DigiRL: 71.9%). It also demonstrates competitive zero-shot\ngeneralization on the ScreenSpot-v2 benchmark. On the more challenging\nAndroidWorld benchmark, Hi-Agent also scales effectively with larger backbones,\nshowing strong adaptability in high-complexity mobile control scenarios."}

Today's\napplications often require LLMs to interact with external tools, marking a\nshift toward more complex agentic systems. To support this, standards such as\nthe Model Context Protocol (MCP) have emerged, enabling agents to access tools\nby including a specification of the capabilities of each tool within the\nprompt. Although this approach expands what agents can do, it also introduces a\ngrowing problem: prompt bloating.

While their outputs\nare fluent, emotionally resonant, and coherent, they are generated through\nstatistical prediction rather than grounded reasoning. This creates the risk of\nhallucination, responses that sound convincing but lack factual validity.\nBuilding on Geoffrey Hinton's observation that AI mirrors human intuition\nrather than reasoning, this paper argues that LLMs operationalize System 1\ncognition at scale: fast, associative, and persuasive, but without reflection\nor falsification. To address this, we introduce the Rose-Frame, a\nthree-dimensional framework for diagnosing cognitive and epistemic drift in\nhuman-AI interaction. The three axes are: (i) Map vs. Territory, which\ndistinguishes representations of reality (epistemology) from reality itself\n(ontology); (ii) Intuition vs. Reason, drawing on dual-process theory to\nseparate fast, emotional judgments from slow, reflective thinking; and (iii)\nConflict vs. Confirmation, which examines whether ideas are critically tested\nthrough disagreement or simply reinforced through mutual validation.

To address this challenge, we propose GuardSpace, a guardrail framework\nfor preserving safety alignment throughout fine-tuning, composed of two key\ncomponents: a safety-sensitive subspace and a harmful-resistant null space.\nFirst, we explicitly decompose pre-trained weights into safety-relevant and\nsafety-irrelevant components using covariance-preconditioned singular value\ndecomposition, and initialize low-rank adapters from the safety-irrelevant\nones, while freezing safety-relevant components to preserve their associated\nsafety mechanism.

However, the effectiveness of search depends on where\nto search, namely, how to encode the domain prior into an operationally\nstructured hypothesis space. To this end, this paper proposes a compact formal\ntheory that describes and measures LLM-assisted iterative search guided by\ndomain priors. We represent an agent as a fuzzy relation operator on inputs and\noutputs to capture feasible transitions; the agent is thereby constrained by a\nfixed safety envelope. To describe multi-step reasoning/search, we weight all\nreachable paths by a single continuation parameter and sum them to obtain a\ncoverage generating function; this induces a measure of reachability\ndifficulty; and it provides a geometric interpretation of search on the graph\ninduced by the safety envelope.

The\nnormal system behavior captured from historical data is integrated into system\nidentification through a Bayesian treatment, to make solutions robust to\ntargeted false data. We experiment on mixed random anomalies (bad data,\ntopology error) and targeted false data injection attack (FDIA) to demonstrate\nour method's 1) cyber resilience: achieving over 70% reduction in estimation\nerror under FDIA; 2) anomalous data identification: being able to alarm and\nlocate anomalous data; 3) almost linear scalability: achieving comparable speed\nwith the snapshot-based baseline, both taking <1min per time tick on the large\n2,383-bus system using a laptop CPU."}

Today's\napplications often require LLMs to interact with external tools, marking a\nshift toward more complex agentic systems. To support this, standards such as\nthe Model Context Protocol (MCP) have emerged, enabling agents to access tools\nby including a specification of the capabilities of each tool within the\nprompt. Although this approach expands what agents can do, it also introduces a\ngrowing problem: prompt bloating. As the number of tools increases, the prompts\nbecome longer, leading to high prompt token costs, increased latency, and\nreduced task success resulting from the selection of tools irrelevant to the\nprompt. To address this issue, we introduce JSPLIT, a taxonomy-driven framework\ndesigned to help agents manage prompt size more effectively when using large\nsets of MCP tools. JSPLIT organizes the tools into a hierarchical taxonomy and\nuses the user's prompt to identify and include only the most relevant tools,\nbased on both the query and the taxonomy structure. In this paper, we describe\nthe design of the taxonomy, the tool selection algorithm, and the dataset used\nto evaluate JSPLIT. Our results show that JSPLIT significantly reduces prompt\nsize without significantly compromising the agent's ability to respond\neffectively. As the number of available tools for the agent grows\nsubstantially, JSPLIT even improves the tool selection accuracy of the agent,\neffectively reducing costs while simultaneously improving task success in\nhigh-complexity agent environments."}

Yet safety violations can lead\nto catastrophic outcomes in real-world deployments. Control Barrier Functions\n(CBFs) offer a principled method to enforce dynamic safety -- traditionally\ndeployed \\emph{online} via safety filters. While the result is safe behavior,\nthe fact that the RL policy does not have knowledge of the CBF can lead to\nconservative behaviors. This paper proposes CBF-RL, a framework for generating\nsafe behaviors with RL by enforcing CBFs \\emph{in training}. CBF-RL has two key\nattributes: (1) minimally modifying a nominal RL policy to encode safety\nconstraints via a CBF term, (2) and safety filtering of the policy rollouts in\ntraining. Theoretically, we prove that continuous-time safety filters can be\ndeployed via closed-form expressions on discrete-time roll-outs. Practically,\nwe demonstrate that CBF-RL internalizes the safety constraints in the learned\npolicy -- both enforcing safer actions and biasing towards safer rewards --\nenabling safe deployment without the need for an online safety filter. We\nvalidate our framework through ablation studies on navigation tasks and on the\nUnitree G1 humanoid robot, where CBF-RL enables safer exploration, faster\nconvergence, and robust performance under uncertainty, enabling the humanoid\nrobot to avoid obstacles and climb stairs safely in real-world settings without\na runtime safety filter."}

To address this, we introduce the Rose-Frame, a\nthree-dimensional framework for diagnosing cognitive and epistemic drift in\nhuman-AI interaction. The three axes are: (i) Map vs. Territory, which\ndistinguishes representations of reality (epistemology) from reality itself\n(ontology); (ii) Intuition vs. Reason, drawing on dual-process theory to\nseparate fast, emotional judgments from slow, reflective thinking; and (iii)\nConflict vs. Confirmation, which examines whether ideas are critically tested\nthrough disagreement or simply reinforced through mutual validation.

To\nunderstand this issue, we analyze training dynamics of RLVR methods by tracking\nthe token-level probability distributions over vocabulary candidates. Our\nanalysis reveals a consistent probability concentration effect where the top-1\ncandidate increasingly accumulates probability mass and suppresses that of\nother candidates. More importantly, stronger over-concentration correlates with\nworse pass@K performance. Inspired by this finding, we propose Simple Pass@K\nOptimization (SimKO), a method designed to mitigate the over-concentration\nissue, thereby encouraging exploration. SimKO operates in an asymmetrical\nmanner. For verified-correct responses, it boosts the probabilities of the\ntop-K candidates. For verified-incorrect responses, it applies stronger\npenalties to the top-1 candidate. We observe that this asymmetric design is\nparticularly effective at mitigating over-concentration when applied at tokens\nwith high entropy.

To\naddress these challenges, we introduce GroundedPRM, a tree-guided and\nfidelity-aware framework for automatic process supervision. To reduce reward\nnoise and enable fine-grained credit assignment, we construct structured\nreasoning paths via Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). To eliminate hallucinated\nsupervision, we validate each intermediate step using an external tool,\nproviding execution-grounded correctness signals.
